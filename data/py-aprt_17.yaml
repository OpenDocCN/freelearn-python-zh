- en: As we said at the beginning, Python is a big language. Our goal with this book
    is get you started in the right direction, to give you the foundation you need
    to not just program Python effectively but direct your own growth with the language.
    Hopefully we’ve done our job!

  zh: 正如我们在开头所说，Python是一门庞大的语言。我们的目标是通过本书让您朝着正确的方向开始，为您提供不仅能有效地编写Python程序，而且能够引导自己的语言成长所需的基础。希望我们做到了！
- en: We encourage you to use what you’ve learned here whenever you can. Practicing
    these skills really is the only way to master them, and we’re sure that your appreciation
    for Python will deepen as you put the language to use. Perhaps you can use Python
    immediately in your job or school work, but if not there are countless open-source
    projects that would love to have your help. Or you could start your own project!
    There are so many ways to get experience with Python that the real problem may
    be finding the one that suits you best.

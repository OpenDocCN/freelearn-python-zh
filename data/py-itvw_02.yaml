    of the Python Software Foundation (PSF). He is the author of *Python Web Programming*
    and co-authored the third edition of *Python in a Nutshell* with Alex Martelli
    and Anna Ravenscroft. Steve works as chief technical officer at Global Stress
    Index, a stress management start-up in the UK, where he oversees the application
    of technology producing systems. A career promoting the Python language has taken
    Steve around the world. He continues to support open source Python projects and

    a television factory. After 18 months, that wasn't really going as well as it
    should. I began to look around for new employment and I saw a job advertising
    a junior technician role at the computing laboratory, at my local university in
    Bradford. So I applied for the job and when I got there, it turned out that junior
    technician was just a job grade. What they actually wanted was a keypunch operator.

- en: The director of the lab thought that I was in danger of going off the rails.
    He decided that I should take a job with the laboratory for six months and learn
    about computers. So obviously I didn't get into the electronics side of it, because
    in those days, computer maintenance was an extremely specialized job. But I learned
    how to operate a computer and I learned how to program. That was the start of
    my career in computing.

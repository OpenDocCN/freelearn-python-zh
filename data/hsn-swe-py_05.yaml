    an imaginary company, *Hand Made Stuff*, that specializes in connecting consumers
    with artisans who create and sell a variety of unique handmade items. Those products
    cover a wide range of materials and purposes, and include furniture, craft, and
    jewelry items, such as beads and bits and pieces for costuming. Pretty much anything

- en: '***Hand Made Stuff** (**HMS**)* is now looking for a way to streamline the
    business process that they use to allow artisans to make their wares available
    through the main website. At present, when an Artisan has created something that
    they''re willing to sell, they send an email to someone at the *HMS* central office,
    with one or more attached photos if it''s something new, sometimes with new photos
    if it''s a new version or set of a previously-offered products. Someone in the
    *HMS* central office copies the relevant information into their web system and
    does a bit of basic setup to make the items available. From there, once a consumer
    decides that they want to order something an Artisan has made, the order goes
    through another manual process that involves the *HMS* central office emailing
    the Artisan with the order information.'

    is developed under it, the development of `hms_sys` will be broken down into several
    iterations. Each iteration, with a single, high-level goal, covers one or more
    chapters, and is concerned with a common set of Stories. Of the agile methodologies
    discussed in [Chapter 4](5d9146f5-67e4-4aee-b9d7-bc945eadc93d.xhtml), *Methodologies,
    Paradigms, and Practices*, these chapters are closer to being a Kanban approach
    than anything else, since the number and total sizes of stories being completed
    in each iteration vary significantly between iterations. In a Scrum setting, these
    iterations would be time-constrained, broken out into time-limited chunks – that
    is, each iteration would be planned to last for some specific length of time.
    The following chapters and their corresponding iterations are goal-oriented instead,
    with each intended to achieve some milestone of system functionality. In that
    respect, they are also close to following a **Feature-Driven Development** model.

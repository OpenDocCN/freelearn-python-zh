    TRS-80 and an Apple II. I always liked programming because it was about exploring
    something new. There was no internet then, so you pretty much just had the source

    to use for teaching and f-strings have greatly simplified string formatting. MicroPython,
    CircuitPython, Raspberry Pi, micro:bit, and Jupyter have inspired more young people
    to make some really interesting projects. It was great fun to see the young developers
    at PyCon UK far exceed our expectations with their projects and lightning talks.

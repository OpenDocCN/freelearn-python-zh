- en: Near the end of 2016, I was brainstorming with my editor about the kinds of
    books might be of interest. I had been doing a series of articles on my blog called
    *PyDev of the Week* that inspired us into crafting a book based on interviewing
    core members of the Python community. I spent some time hashing out 20 names of
    people that I thought would be good for the book and then I started contacting
    them in 2017.

  zh: 在2016年年底，我和我的编辑一起头脑风暴，讨论哪些类型的书籍可能会引起人们的兴趣。我一直在我的博客上写一系列名为 *PyDev of the Week*
    的文章，这激发了我们基于采访Python社区核心成员来编写一本书的想法。我花了一些时间列出了20个我认为适合这本书的人名，然后在2017年开始联系他们。
- en: Over the course of about 8-12 months, I ended up interviewing 20 pillars of
    the Python community, although my list changed several times over that period.
    Some people weren't available or couldn't be reached. But I persevered and managed
    to pull together a well-rounded set of representatives of the Python programming
    community.

  zh: 在大约8-12个月的时间里，我最终采访了20位Python社区的支柱人物，尽管在这段时间里我的名单改变了好几次。有些人不可用或无法联系上。但我坚持不懈，并设法聚集了一组全面代表Python编程社区的代表性人物。
- en: In this book, you will get interesting anecdotes about the history of Python
    and its creators, such as Brett Cannon and Nick Coghlan. You will discover why
    Python didn't have Unicode support in its first release, and you'll hear from
    core developers about where they think Python is going in the future. You will
    also hear from some well-known Python authors, like Al Sweigart, Luciano Ramalho,
    and Doug Hellman.

    Sweigart、Luciano Ramalho和Doug Hellman的观点。
- en: I also spoke with some of the creators or core developers of popular third-party
    packages in Python, such as web2py (Massimo Di Pierro), SQLAlchemy (Mike Bayer),
    and the Twisted Framework (Glyph Lefkowitz), among others.

  zh: 我还与一些Python中流行的第三方包的创建者或核心开发者进行了交谈，例如web2py（Massimo Di Pierro）、SQLAlchemy（Mike
    Bayer）和Twisted框架（Glyph Lefkowitz）等。
- en: My interview with Carol Willing was a lot of fun. She is also a core developer
    of the Python language itself, so learning her views on women in technology and
    Python was quite enlightening. She is also a contributor to Project Jupyter, so
    learning more about that project was exciting.

    Jupyter的贡献者，因此了解更多关于这个项目的内容非常令人兴奋。
- en: I think you will find Alex Martelli and Steve Holden's interviews to be especially
    compelling as they have been working with Python for a very long time and have
    many interesting insights.

- en: There is a lot to learn from all the individuals that I spoke with. If you happen
    to know them, you know that even better than I do. All of them were great to chat
    with and very responsive to me even on the shortest of timelines. If you happen
    to meet them at a conference, be sure to thank them for their contributions.

- en: Special thanks go out to all the people I interviewed. They took time out of
    their lives to help me with this project and I truly appreciate it. I also want
    to thank my editors for keeping this project on track. Finally, I would like to
    thank my wife, Evangeline, for putting up with me interviewing people at random
    times throughout the summer. And finally, I want to thank you, dear reader, for
    checking out this book.

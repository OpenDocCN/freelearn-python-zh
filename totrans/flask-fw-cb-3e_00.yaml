- en: Flask, the lightweight Python web framework, is popular due to its powerful
    modular design that lets you build scalable web apps. With this recipe-based guide,
    you’ll explore modern solutions and the best practices to build web applications
    using Flask.

- en: Updated to the latest version of Flask 2.2.x and Python 3.11.x, this third edition
    of *Flask Framework Cookbook* moves away from some of the old and obsolete libraries
    and introduces recipes on bleeding-edge technologies. You’ll discover different
    ways of using Flask to create, deploy, and manage microservices.

- en: This book takes you through a number of recipes that will help you understand
    the power of Flask and its extensions. You will start by exploring the different
    configurations that a Flask application can make use of. From here, you will learn
    how to work with templates, before learning about the ORM and view layers, which
    act as the foundation of web applications. Then, you will learn how to write RESTful
    APIs with Flask, after learning various authentication techniques.

- en: As you move ahead, you will learn how to write an admin interface, followed
    by debugging and logging errors in Flask. You will also learn how to make your
    applications multilingual and gain insight into the various testing techniques.
    You will learn about the different deployment and post-deployment techniques on
    platforms such as Apache, Tornado, NGINX, Gunicorn, Sentry, New Relic, and Datadog.
    Finally, you will learn about popular microservices tools, such as Docker, Kubernetes,
    Google Cloud Run, and GitHub Actions, that can be used to build highly scalable
    services.

    – that is, GPT. Here, you will learn about some simple and basic yet powerful
    implementations of GPT to build automated text completion fields, chatbots, and
    AI-powered image generations. Before you complete the book, you will learn about
    some additional tips and tricks that will be helpful to handle specific use cases,
    such as full-text searching, caching, email, and asynchronous operations.

- en: If you are a web developer who wants to learn more about developing scalable
    and production-ready applications in Flask, this is the book for you. You’ll also
    find this book useful even if you are already aware of Flask’s major extensions
    and want to use them for better application development. This book can also come
    in handy if you quickly want to refer to any specific topic on Flask, any of its
    popular extensions, or some specific use cases. Basic Python programming experience
    along with some understanding of web development and its related terminology is
    assumed.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19111_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016), *Flask Configurations*, explains
    the different ways in which Flask can be configured to suit the various needs
    of any project. It starts by telling us how to set up a development environment
    and moves on to the different configuration techniques.'

    the basics of Jinja2 templating from the perspective of Flask and explains how
    to make applications with modular and extensible templates.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19111_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129), *Data Modeling in Flask*,
    deals with one of the most important parts of any application – that is, its interaction
    with database systems. We will see how Flask can connect to different database
    systems, define models, and query databases to retrieve and feed data.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B19111_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184), *Working with Views*, deals
    with the core of web frameworks. It talks about how to interact with web requests
    and the proper responses to these requests. It covers various methods of handling
    requests properly and designing them in the best way.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19111_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor273), *Web Forms with WTForms*,
    covers form handling, which is an important part of any web application. As much
    as forms are important, their validation holds equal importance, if not more.
    Presenting this information to users in an interactive fashion adds a lot of value
    to an application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B19111_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor328), *Authenticating in Flask*,
    talks about authentication, which acts as the red line between an application
    being secure and insecure. It deals with multiple social and enterprise login
    techniques in detail. Authentication is an important part of any application,
    be it web-based, desktop, or mobile.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B19111_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor385), *RESTful API Building*, explains
    REST as a protocol and then discusses writing RESTful APIs for Flask applications
    using libraries, as well as completely customized APIs. An API can be summarized
    as a developer’s interface to an application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B19111_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor414), *Admin Interface for Flask
    Apps*, focuses on writing admin views for Flask applications. First, we will write
    completely custom-made views and then write them with the help of an extension.
    As opposed to the very popular Python-based web framework Django, Flask does not
    provide an admin interface by default. Although this can be seen as a shortcoming
    by many, this gives developers the flexibility to create an admin interface as
    per their requirements and have complete control over an application.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B19111_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor469), *Internationalization and
    Localization*, expands the scope of Flask applications and covers the basics of
    how to enable support for multiple languages. Web applications usually are not
    limited to one geographical region or to serving people from one linguistic domain.
    For example, a web application intended for users in Europe will be expected to
    support other European languages, such as German, French, Italian, Spanish, and
    so on, apart from English.'

- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B19111_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor502), *Debugging, Error Handling,
    and Testing*, moves on from being completely development-oriented to testing our
    application. With better error handling and tests, the robustness of the application
    increases manifold, and debugging makes the lives of developers easier. It is
    very important to know how robust our application is and to keep track of how
    it has worked and performed. This, in turn, gives rise to the need to be informed
    when something goes wrong in the application. Testing in itself is a very huge
    topic and has several books devoted to it.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 11*](B19111_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor610), *Deployment and Post-Deployment*,
    covers the various ways and tools with which an application can be deployed. Then,
    you will learn about application monitoring, which helps us to keep track of the
    performance of the application. Deployment of an application and managing the
    application post-deployment is as important as developing it. There can be various
    ways of deploying an application, and choosing the best way depends on the requirements.'

    explores how to package Flask applications with Docker and deploy them with Kubernetes.
    We will also see how to serve applications in a serverless fashion by leveraging
    Google Cloud Run and GitHub Actions. *Microservices* is one of the biggest buzzwords
    in modern software technology. These are as useful as they are popular and make
    the lives of developers easier. They allows people to focus on development rather
    than investing that time in thinking about the deployment of applications.'

- en: In the third edition of this book, we will explore the beautiful world of **graphical
    user interfaces** (**GUIs**) using the Python programming language. We will be
    using the latest version of Python 3\. All of the recipes from the first and second
    editions are included in this edition, except for the outdated `OpenGL` library,
    which is not very Pythonic, after all. We have added an entirely new chapter to
    the third edition, and we have dramatically changed the style of this third edition
    to give it more of a cookbook format. By doing so, hopefully, it is easier to
    apply the recipes to real-world programming situations, providing tested and working
    solutions.

- en: This is a programming cookbook. Every chapter is self-contained and explains
    a certain programming solution. We will start very simply, yet throughout the
    course of this book, we will build a working application written in Python 3\.
    Each recipe will extend the building of this application. Along the way, we will
    talk about networks, queues, databases, the PyQt5 graphical library, and many
    more technologies. We will apply design patterns and use best practices.

    language, but that is not really required to successfully use this book. This
    book can also be used as an introduction to the Python programming language, if,
    and only if, you are dedicated in your desire to become a Pythonic programmer.

    time extending your professional toolbox by adding the ability to write GUIs using
    Python to your toolbox.

- en: This book is for programmers who wish to create a GUI. You might be surprised
    by what we can achieve by creating beautiful, functional, and powerful GUIs using
    the Python programming language. Python is a wonderful, intuitive programming
    language, and is very easy to learn.

- en: All the recipes in this book were developed using Python 3.7 on a Windows 10
    64-bit OS. They have not been tested on any other configuration. As Python is
    a cross-platform language, the code from each recipe is expected to run everywhere.

    some modules such as `tkinter`, which we will use throughout this book.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are using Python 3.7, and the creator of Python intentionally chose not to
    make it backward-compatible with Python 2\. If you are using a Mac or Python 2,
    you might have to install Python 3.7 from [www.python.org](http://www.python.org) in
    order to successfully run the recipes in this book.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you really wish to run the code in this book on Python 2.7, you will have
    to make some adjustments. For example, `tkinter` in Python 2.x has an uppercase *T*.
    The Python 2.7 print statement is a function in Python 3.7 and requires parentheses.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the **End of Life** (**EOL**) for the Python 2.x branch has been extended
    to the year 2020, I would strongly recommend that you start using Python 3.7 and
    later.

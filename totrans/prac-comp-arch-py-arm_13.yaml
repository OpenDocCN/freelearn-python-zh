  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ARM implements 12-bit literals in an unusual way, using a technique borrowed
    from the world of floating-point arithmetic. Four of the 12 bits of a literal
    are used to scale an 8-bit constant. That is, the 8-bit constant is rotated right
    by twice the number in the 4-bit scaling field. The four most-significant bits
    of the literal field specify the literal’s alignment within a 32-bit word. If
    the 8-bit immediate value is `N` and the 4-bit alignment is `n`, then the value
    of the literal is given by `N` rotated *right* by *2n* places. For example, if
    the 8-bit literal is `0xAB` and `n` is `4`, the resulting 32-bit literal is `0xAB000000`
    because of the eight-position right rotation (2 x 4). Remember that an eight rotate
    right position is equivalent to a 32 - 8 = 24 bit shift left. *Figure 11**.1*
    demonstrates some 32-bit literals and the 12-bit literal codes that generate them.

    to provide a number in the range 0 to 4,095, rather than a number in the range
    0 to 255 scaled by the power of 2? The answer is that ARM’s designers determined
    that the scaled literals were more useful in real-world applications than unscaled
    numbers. For example, suppose you wanted to clear all bits of a 32-bit word, except
    bits 8 to 15\. You would need to `AND` it with the literal `0b00000000000000001111111100000000`
    or `0x0000FF00` in hexadecimal. Using the scaling mechanism, we can take 8 bits
    `0x11111111` and shift them left by 8 bits (i.e., right by 24 bits) to get the
    required constant. However, the scaling factor `n` needs twice the number of rotation
    rights to achieve this. That is (32 – 8)/2, which is 12\. Consequently, the literal
    stored in the 12-bit instruction field is 12,255, or CFF in hexadecimal.

    relative addressing to access it. In other words, you dump a 32-value in memory
    near (or within) the program and then access it using program counter relative
    addressing. This is the reason for pseudo-instructions. Without pseudo-instructions,
    you’d have to calculate the relative address between the current `pc` and the

    a lot of other names (indexed and pointer-based). In this case, the address is
    given by the contents of a register. The instruction specifies not the actual
    address of an operand but the register that points to it. Because you can manipulate
    data in a register, you can manipulate addresses and access data structures such
    as arrays and tables.

    can use a pointer and increment it or decrement it beforehand (or after it is
    used).

- en: We also looked at a special form of register indirect addressing, relative addressing,
    where the pointer is the program counter itself – that is, the address of an operand
    is specified with respect to the instruction that accesses it. This means that
    code using program counter relative addressing can be moved around in memory without
    any addresses being recalculated.

    – the subroutine and the stack. This topic is also heavily related to addressing
    modes.

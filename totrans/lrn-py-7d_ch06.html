<p>In&#160;this chapter, we will understand the principles and working of different control statements, namely,&#160;<kbd>if</kbd>, <kbd>if...else</kbd>, and&#160;<kbd>if...elif...else</kbd>. We will also be understanding the principles and working of various loops, namely, the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> and <kbd>while</kbd> loops. We will also get acquainted with the&#160;<kbd>xrange</kbd>&#160;function and statements such as&#160;<kbd>break</kbd>, <kbd>continue</kbd>, and <kbd>pass</kbd>.</p>

<p>Now, most of the beginners must be wondering what are control statements. Control statements are nothing but a series of statements that a program follows to get the desired results. Let's first try to understand what are control statements and why they form an essential part of any programming language. You might have used the ATM machine to withdraw money. What do you do when you insert your debit card? The very first thing you watch on the screen are the options to chose from the menu. Now you have to perform certain actions, else your card would be turned away after some time, in case you keep the computer waiting for a long time. When you choose to withdraw, you have to provide the correct amount, which is required to be withdrawn from the machine. If you provide the wrong amount, the computer will&#160;immediately give the message "Please enter the correct amount". What happened here? Did you notice? Here computer is merely following instructions. It has been ordered to accept only the correct amount and prompt an error message on input of the wrong amount. This is one such scenario where you can see the use of control statements.</p>

            <article>
                
<p><em>If</em> can be understood as metaphorical English <em>what if</em> which most people use in their day to day life. What if this doesn't happen? If I were to become a billionaire. If this match is drawn we are out of the champions' league. If Churchill had not come to power Battle of Britain would have been lost. If this car doesn't start, use the other one. We are loaded with numerous examples from across the globe on usage of <em>if</em>. Same is the case with programming languages. Majority of the programming languages have control statements and you will find majority of them use the keyword <kbd>if</kbd> in their control statements. Python is no different and also facilitates the usage of if. &#160;Let's understand with an example:</p>
<pre><span class="command">password= raw_input("Enter the passwordt")</span><span> </span><br/><span class="syntex">if </span><span class="command">password=="MI6"</span><span>: </span><br/><span>    </span><span> </span><span class="syntex">print </span><span class="command">"Welcome Mr. Bond."</span>
</pre>
<div class="packt_tip">For entering&#160;inputs through command line <kbd>raw_input()</kbd> function&#160;is used in Python.<br/>
Any function or control statement block in Python is started by placing the colon at the end of the line. Colon here marks the beginning of the <kbd>if</kbd> block and <kbd>print</kbd> statement begins after one tab space right after the colon. Programmers usually make a mistake by mixing space with tab right after the colon.&#160;</div>
<p>In the preceding example, after password is entered, the interpreter checks for the entered string and compares with <kbd>"MI6"</kbd>; if password entered is correct, it prints <kbd>Welcome Mr. Bond.</kbd>. If the password is wrong, it will skip the <kbd>if</kbd> block and terminate the program:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="235" width="482" class="image-border" src="images/image-1-4.jpg"/></div>
<p>But merely using only if doesn't give much of the choice to the interpreter and it has to terminate the program. What if the interpreter is given an alternative for a failed <kbd>if</kbd> test. In that case,&#160;<kbd>else</kbd> can be used to give choice to the interpreter.&#160;</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Syntax</strong></div>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>if condition :<br/>        statements-1<br/>else:<br/>       statements-2
</pre>
</div>
<p>Let's take an example to understand <kbd>if</kbd> and <kbd>else</kbd> conditions:</p>
<pre>password= raw_input("Enter the passwordt") <br/>if password=="MI6":        <br/>   print "Welcome Mr. Bond." <br/>else:        <br/>   print "Access Denied."
</pre>
<p>Here, if the password is entered wrongly, the interpreter will immediately execute statement inside the <kbd>else</kbd> block. Here, the control statement is divided into two blocks one is the&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> block and the other&#160;is the&#160;<kbd>else</kbd> block. At one time, the interpreter will execute either of the two blocks:</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">If there are a series of actions to be executed, then the&#160;<kbd>if...elif...else</kbd> block can be used. Most of the programming languages provide the&#160;<kbd>if...else if...else</kbd> control block, while Python has shortened <kbd>else if</kbd> to <kbd>elif</kbd> but the principle remains the same, that is, it divides the complete control block into number of blocks for specific action to be executed. It can be interpreted with day-to-day examples, for example, if this debit card doesn't work, use this credit card, else pay with a cheque.&#160;</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Syntax</strong></div>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">

<p>Here, in the syntax, we are illustrating a series of branching statements under different conditions which is also called <strong>conditional branching</strong> in any language. First, we encounter an&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> block and if the condition inside the <kbd>if</kbd> block is satisfied or becomes true, only then will the&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> block be executed. If while&#160;executing the condition inside the <kbd>if</kbd> block is not satisfied, then the control is handed over to the immediate condition statement, that is,&#160;<kbd>elif</kbd> block, where the condition would be checked differently, and, finally, we have the&#160;<kbd>else</kbd> block, where if all the conditions before the&#160;<kbd>else</kbd> condition fail, then the&#160;<kbd>else</kbd> block will process the code.</p>
<p>Now, let's try to put college grades into use and understand how we can put the grades through programming:</p>
<table class="gridtable">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Grade</th>
<th>Score</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>All grades above 4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>All grades above 3 and below 3.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>All grades above 2.5 and below 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>All grades below 2.5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<pre>num =float(raw_input("Enter the number:"))<br/>if num &gt; 4:<br/>         letter = 'A'<br/>elif num &gt; 3:<br/>          letter = 'B'<br/>elif num &gt; 2:<br/>          letter = 'C'<br/>else:<br/>          letter = 'D'<br/>print "The Grade is " , letter
</pre>
<p>Here we have declared a variable <kbd>num</kbd> to store the marks entered and we have created a set of conditions, which will check the marks input. For example, if the marks entered are greater than <kbd>4</kbd>, then the code inside the&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> condition would be executed and the&#160;<kbd>letter</kbd> variable would be assigned the value <kbd>'A'</kbd> or grade A. Likewise, if the marks entered are less than or equal to <kbd>4</kbd>, but greater than <kbd>3</kbd>, then the <kbd>if</kbd> condition would fail and the control will be passed onto the&#160;<kbd>elif num&gt;3</kbd> conditional block and the <kbd>letter</kbd> variable would be assigned the value of <kbd>'B'</kbd> or the grades B would be assigned to the entered marks. Here, the interpreter checks for the entered input and executes the correct block as per the correct marks entered. We entered marks <kbd>4.5</kbd> and the interpreter gives us grade <kbd>A</kbd> as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There might be a situation where you might require to run a single block of code a number of times, in that situation, loops come in handy. Loops come handy in situations such as&#160;iterating through data structures in any programming language or traversing through large sets of data to filter out junk data, followed by certain keywords followed by alphanumeric characters followed by certain special characters.&#160;</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Types of loops</h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>There are two types of loops, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Definite</strong>: In this case, the code of block runs for a defined number of times. This is useful when the programmer exactly knows in how many counts the task will be executed or let's assume that he knows the number of elements inside the data structure. For example, the strength of a classroom.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Indefinite</strong>: In this case, the code of block runs until&#160;the condition is true. This is useful where the count is unknown. For example, trying to figure out the number of times London appears in a literary article.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before further delving into loops, let's try to understand the&#160;<kbd>range()</kbd> and <kbd>xrange()</kbd> functions in Python.</p>
<p>The <kbd>range()</kbd> function comes handy when you want to generate a list on-the-fly. Its syntax is as follows:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Syntax</strong></div>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>range(start-value, end-value, difference between the values)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image4-2.jpg"/></div>
<p>Here,&#160;<kbd>range(10)</kbd> will generate a list, which has elements starting from <kbd>0</kbd>&#160;upto <kbd>9</kbd>. <kbd>range(2,10)</kbd> means the list will be generated starting from <kbd>2</kbd> and will have elements upto&#160;<kbd>9</kbd>. The <kbd>range(2,10,3)</kbd> means the list will be generated starting with <kbd>2</kbd> and having a difference of <kbd>3</kbd> after each element.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Syntax</strong></div>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>xrange(start-value, end-value, difference between the values)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign packt_infobox">The <kbd>xrange()</kbd> is quite similar to <kbd>range()</kbd> except that <kbd>xrange()</kbd> releases or frees the memory when not in use, whereas <kbd>range()</kbd> doesn't release the memory.&#160;</div>

            <header>
                <h1 class="header-title">Definite loop</h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>It is a loop which&#160;is executed a set&#160;number of times. The best example that can be thought of a definite loop is a <kbd>for</kbd> loop. Let's take a look at the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Syntax</strong></div>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>for &lt;variable&gt; in xrange(&lt;an integer expression &gt;):<br/>  &lt;statement-1 &gt;<br/>        &lt;statement-n &gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>The first line of code in the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop is sometimes called the <strong>loop header</strong>. An integer expression&#160;specifies the number of times the loop has to run. The colon <kbd>:</kbd> ends the loop header. Python's&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop block or body consists of the statements below the header that will be executed a set&#160;number of times. The <kbd>for</kbd> loop body must be indented. The statements inside the loop body are executed sequentially on each run.&#160;</p>
<p>Let's try some example:</p>
<pre>for a in xrange(4):<br/>    print "Hello all"
</pre>
<p>Here, in the preceding example, we are trying to print <kbd>"Hello all"</kbd> four times.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image5-3.jpg"/></div>
<p>Here, a is any variable or iterating variable or counter variable whose initial value is <kbd>0</kbd> and will execute <kbd>4</kbd> times. Let's take another example:</p>
<pre><span class="syntex">for</span><span> count </span><span class="syntex">in</span><span> xrange(4): </span><br/><span>   </span><span class="syntex">print </span><span class="command">count</span>
</pre>
<p>Here the value of <kbd>count</kbd> will be printed one at a time and always on a new line.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="290" width="602" class="image-border" src="images/image6-2.jpg"/></div>
<p>In the preceding examples, the output is printed on a&#160;new line, but the output can be formatted to be printed in one line. For this, comma or <kbd>,</kbd> can be used as shown:</p>
<pre><span class="syntex">for</span><span> count </span><span class="syntex">in</span><span> xrange(4): </span><br/><span>   </span><span class="syntex">print </span><span class="command">count</span><span>,</span>
</pre>
<p>The use of <kbd>,</kbd> will give you an output similar to this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="277" width="587" class="image-border" src="images/image7-2.jpg"/></div>
<div>Let's consider some more examples:</div>
<pre><span>product =1 </span><br/><span class="syntex">for</span><span> count </span><span class="syntex">in</span><span> xrange(1,5): </span><br/><span>  product = product*count </span><br/><span>  </span><span class="syntex">print </span><span>product,</span>
</pre>
<p>We are interested to print the product times count. For this, we create a variable product whose value we initialize with <kbd>1</kbd> and generate a list of numbers from <kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>5</kbd>, but not including <kbd>5</kbd>. For one iteration of the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop, the product is multiplied the number of times the&#160;<kbd>count</kbd> value.</p>
<p>Here, the&#160;<kbd>count</kbd> value is nothing but the numbers from our list. We will be getting an output as shown here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image-8.jpg"/></div>
<p>Let's take another example of the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop. Here, we are interested in printing each character in a given string:</p>
<pre>for each in 'VIENNA PHILHARMONIC' :<br/>       print each,
</pre>
<p>For every single iteration of the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop variable,&#160;<kbd>each</kbd> will store the value of every single character and will print them one by one in a single line, as shown here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image9-2.jpg"/></div>

                <h1 class="header-title">Indefinite loop</h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">So far we learned about definite loop, now we will understand what is an indefinite loop?&#160;Indefinite loop is a loop that will continue to run infinite number of times until and unless it is asked to stop. In order to execute an indefinite loop, we use the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> statement.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Syntax</strong></div>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>while &lt;condition&gt;:<br/>  &lt;statements&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>This loop will continue to execute until&#160;the condition is met&#160;and will terminate once the condition is not met. Let's try to understand with an example:</p>
<pre> checking_acc = 5678143<br/> num = int(raw_input("Enter the account numbert"))<br/> while checking_acc != num:<br/>     print "Wrong number "<br/>     num = int(raw_input("Enter the right account numbert"))<br/> print "n*********"<br/> print "Your account number is" , num
</pre>
<p>Here, we are interested to validate a checking bank account. We take a variable <kbd>checking_acc</kbd>, which stores the value of a checking bank account. We take input from the user for his/her checking bank account number and store it in the <kbd>num</kbd> variable. We check the condition in the <kbd>while</kbd> loop and compare the input entered with our existing record of checking bank account. Here, until the&#160;correct account number is entered, the condition will keep on failing. So, in our case, if checking account is falsely entered, the user will get the message <kbd>Wrong number</kbd> and will be prompted to enter the correct number. Once he enters the correct number, the condition becomes true and the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop terminates. You can see the output here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image10-2.jpg"/></div>
<p>But there is a little tweak with which the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop can be used and made to behave like&#160;a definite loop. Let's try to understand with an example:</p>
<pre>sum = 0<br/> for counter in xrange(1,10):<br/>    sum = sum+counter<br/>    print sum,<br/>    print "n"<br/> sum = 0<br/> counter = 1<br/> while (counter &lt; 10):<br/>     sum = sum + counter<br/>     print sum,<br/>     counter= counter + 1
</pre>
<p>In our previous example, either the condition needs to be failed or it needs to be passed for the <kbd>while</kbd> loop to terminate. But if we&#160;insert a condition inside the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop in such a manner that it will run for that definite time, then we can make the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop to behave like a definite loop. In the preceding example, we are interested to print the sum of numbers from <kbd>1</kbd> to <kbd>10</kbd>. We are achieving the same result using the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop as well, when using the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop. The <kbd>for</kbd> loop is simple and self-explanatory. To achieve similar results, we create a&#160;<kbd>counter</kbd> variable just before the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop and initialize the variable with the value of <kbd>1</kbd>. Now, until the value of <kbd>counter</kbd> is less than <kbd>10</kbd>, it will continue to execute. Inside the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop, we will increment the value of <kbd>counter</kbd> by <kbd>1</kbd> for every iteration. Thus, the loop will run only <kbd>10</kbd> times and on the tenth iteration, it will terminate. In the succeeding screenshot, the output of the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop is displayed one by one on a new line, while the output of the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop is displayed in a single line to differentiate the execution of both the loops (that is, &#160;<kbd>for</kbd> and <kbd>while</kbd>):</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="275" width="543" class="image-border" src="images/image11-2.jpg"/></div>
<p>Both the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> <span>loop</span>&#160;and <kbd>while</kbd> loop produce the same outcome. But the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop block is a bit large, containing extra statements. The <kbd>counter</kbd>&#160;is the loop control variable, which must be explicitly initialized before the loop header. The <kbd>while</kbd> loop requires extra effort to make it work as a definite loop, but there would be several situations where the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop will be the only solution available at hand.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Execution of an infinite <kbd>while</kbd> loop can be broken by the use of the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement. Let's understand with an example:</p>
<pre><span>sum = 0</span><br/><span class="syntex">while True:</span><span> </span><br/><span>   data = int(raw_input("Enter the data or press 0 to quit :")) </span><br/><span>   </span><span class="syntex">if </span><span>data == 0: </span><br/><span>      </span><span class="syntex">break </span><br/><span>   sum = sum+data </span><br/><span class="syntex">print </span><span>"Sum is ", sum</span>
</pre>
<p>Here we intend to print the sum of numbers being entered. In the preceding example, the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop condition has been set to be Boolean, that is,&#160;<kbd>True</kbd>. In this case, the <kbd>while</kbd> loop will continue to execute infinitely as the condition will always be true. However, we can break this loop by setting up a condition check inside the <kbd>while</kbd> loop and then using a <kbd>break</kbd> statement. So, the loop will continue to run until&#160;the user keeps on entering numbers, but it will terminate as soon as the number <kbd>0</kbd> is entered. Here, once <kbd>0</kbd> is entered, the <kbd>if</kbd> condition inside the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop will check and as the number entered is <kbd>0</kbd>, the code inside the&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> block will execute, which is a <kbd>break</kbd> statement. This will terminate the loop and print the sum of the numbers entered as shown here:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="316" width="648" class="image-border" src="images/image12-1.jpg"/></div>
<p>Here, the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop has Boolean value <kbd>True</kbd>, which is an entry condition for the <kbd>while</kbd> loop. In this case, the loop would execute at least once. But there is another way to achieve the preceding outcome without using the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement. Let's have look at another example:</p>
<pre><span>sum = 0</span><br/><span>flag = 1 </span><br/><span class="syntex">while </span><span>flag == 1: </span><br/><span>   data = int(raw_input("Enter the number or press 0 to quit :")) </span><br/><span>   </span><span class="syntex">if </span><span>data == 0: </span><br/><span>      </span><span class="syntex">flag =0 </span><br/><span>   sum = sum+data </span><br/><span class="syntex">print </span><span>"Sum is ", sum </span>
</pre>
<p>We have achieved the same output without using the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement. Here, we have used a <kbd>flag</kbd> variable instead of a <kbd>break</kbd> statement:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image13-1.jpg"/></div>
<p>The initial entry point of the <kbd>while</kbd> loop is the value of the&#160;<kbd>flag</kbd> variable as <kbd>1</kbd>. Until&#160;the <kbd>flag</kbd> variable is <kbd>0</kbd>, the loop will continue to execute. When <kbd>0</kbd> is entered, the value of <kbd>flag</kbd> variable becomes <kbd>0</kbd> and the loop terminates.</p>

<p>The <kbd>break</kbd> statements are used to change the flow of any block of statements. There might be a situation where we might need to break the loop in between; in that scenario, using the <kbd>break</kbd> statement will help us achieve our goal. Let's have a look:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>attraction_in_Vienna = ['Stephen plaz', 'Maria-Hilfer strasse', 'Donau-insel', 'Vienna-Philharmonic']<br/>first = "Donau-insel"<br/>for each in attraction_in_Vienna:<br/>     if(each == first):<br/>          break<br/>print each
</pre>
</div>
<p>Here we have created a list of attractions available in the city of Vienna. We take a variable <kbd>first</kbd> and assign it a value as <kbd>"Donau-insel"</kbd>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image14-1.jpg"/></div>
<p>We want to print all the places of attraction in Vienna. But there is a twist. We would like to stop the moment <kbd>Donau-insel</kbd> occurs in the list. Hence, for every iteration of the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop, the&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> block will check each and every element inside the list and compare it with the value we have given to compare, that is, <kbd>"Donau-insel"</kbd>. So the program will print all the names appearing before <kbd>Donau-insel</kbd>, and the moment <kbd>Donau-insel</kbd> occurs, the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement terminates the loop. There can be several situations where the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement can be handy such as&#160;searching for a keyword in a stack of words, searching a palindrome, and so on.</p>

<p>They are loops inside loops and there could be more than two loops each within another loop. In most situations, we generally use the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement to break the inner loop while the outer loop will continue to execute. Let's try to understand its working with an example:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>list1 = ["London","Paris","New York","Berlin"]<br/>for each in list1:<br/> str1 = each<br/> for s in str1:<br/>     if (s =="o"):<br/>        break<br/>     print s,<br/> print "n"
</pre>
</div>
<p>Here we are interested to print all the city's names and are not interested to print anything after character <kbd>o</kbd>. For this, we create a list of cities and we use the&#160;<kbd>for</kbd> loop to iterate through the list. We will use the second <kbd>for</kbd> loop to eliminate any characters appearing after character o. This condition is checked inside the second <kbd>for</kbd> loop, which is nested inside the first <kbd>for</kbd> loop with the help of the&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> statement:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image15-1.jpg"/></div>
<p>In this case, the inner loop breaks whenever char <kbd>o</kbd> is encountered, while the outer loop continues to execute.</p>

<p>While the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement terminates, the entire loop <kbd>continue</kbd> statement will skip that step and the loop will continue thereafter.</p>
<p>Let's discuss with an example:</p>
<pre>movies = ['P.S I Love You', 'Shutter Island', 'Les Miserables play', 'King's Speech', 'Forest Gump']
</pre>
<p>Here is the list of movies but <em>Les Miserables</em> is the&#160;name of a play and we would like to skip this name and want the program to print all the names of the movies:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>movies = ["P.S I Love You", "Shutter Island", "Les Miserables Play", "King's Speech", "Forest Gump"] <br/><br/>for each in movies:<br/>    if (each== "Les Miserables Play"):<br/>          continue<br/>    print each
</pre>
</div>
<p>The <kbd>for</kbd> loop iterates through each element of the list and the&#160;<kbd>if</kbd> block checks the condition for the occurrence of <kbd>"Les Miserables Play"</kbd>.&#160;</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image16-1.jpg"/></div>
<p>Here, the <kbd>continue</kbd> statement just skipped <kbd>"Les Miserables Play"</kbd> and the loop continued to print the rest of the names of the movies.</p>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">There can be scenarios in various programming problems, where you might&#160;want to reserve a loop for future use. We may not want to write anything inside the block, but at the same time the block cannot have an empty body. In this case, we use the <kbd>pass</kbd> statement to construct a body that does nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">
<pre>def fun():<br/>    pass<br/>for each in "Australia":<br/>    pass
</pre>
</div>
<p>If you are wondering what is <kbd>def fun()</kbd>, it's nothing but defining the function with an empty body. In this case, the body does nothing:</p>

<p>We started with understanding the concept of control statements and why they are essential in our day-to-day programming problems. We had a chance to look into two functions <kbd>range()</kbd> and <kbd>xrange()</kbd> that are used to generate a list on-the-fly. We learned about definite loops and indefinite loops. We also learned about the difference between definite and indefinite loops. Under definite loops, we learned about various control statements such as <kbd>if</kbd>, <kbd>if...else</kbd>, <kbd>if...elif...else</kbd>, and <kbd>for</kbd> loop. While, in indefinite loops, we had a chance to study the while statement and how we can also use the&#160;<kbd>while</kbd> loop to work as a definite loop. We saw the usage of while with the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement and without the&#160;<kbd>break</kbd> statement. We also looked into the working of the&#160;<kbd>continue</kbd> and <kbd>pass</kbd> statements.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn about functions and scope of variables.</p>

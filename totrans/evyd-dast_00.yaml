- en: Quite often, as software developers, when presented with a new task or challenge,
    we find ourselves grabbing code fragments or patterns that we are most familiar
    with. We typically make this choice because those fragments and patterns represent
    the shortest path between two points, namely, the client’s requirements and a
    deadline (also known as payday). However, this approach sometimes prevents us
    from learning new skills and ideas that will make us better and more efficient
    developers.

- en: This book was written to give aspiring, new, or relatively inexperienced but
    busy developers an opportunity to step back and examine some of the fundamental
    concepts regarding data types and data structures. To that, we will examine how
    these types and structures are built, how they function, and how we can leverage
    them in our everyday applications. By doing so, we will gain new knowledge, skills,
    abilities and, hopefully, get some new ideas on how to leverage these basic components.

    "Chapter 1. Data Types: Foundational Structures"), *Data Types: Foundational Structures*,
    is a very brief overview of basic data types that comprise of data structures.
    This will be a rapid overview as even new programmers will already be familiar
    with some or most of these components. Attention will be paid to applications
    for each type, best practices, and a high-level comparison of any variations between
    platforms.'

    programming concepts related to data structures. More specifically, this book
    is for new or self-taught programmers or programmers who range in experience from
    relatively new to having three or four years of experience. This book focuses
    on the four languages most commonly used in mobile software development, so the
    audience also includes those interested in mobile software development. The reader
    should have a basic understanding of programming, including how to create console
    applications, and how to use an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, for

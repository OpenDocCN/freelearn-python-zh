    has for team structure and communication. As the successful building of any non-tiny
    piece of software depends heavily on successful communication and collaboration
    between one or more teams of multiple developers, this factor should be taken
    into consideration. Also, the structure of the software can have a profound effect
    on how different elements are accessed, so how software is structured has ramifications
    for security.

    perhaps could calculate a parabolic trajectory or factorize numbers. The very
    first computer program, designed in 1843 by Ada Lovelace, calculated a sequence
    of Bernoulli numbers. A hundred years after that, during the Second World War,
    electronic computers were invented to break encryption codes. As the possibilities
    of the new invention started to be explored, more and more complex operations
    and systems were designed. Tools like compilers and high-level languages multiplied
    the number of possibilities and the rapid advancement of hardware allowed more
    and more operations to be performed. This quickly created a need to manage the
    growing complexity and apply consistent engineering principles to the creation
    of software.

    or using out-of-the-box modules and packages. With this great power comes the
    great responsibility of managing the explosion of complexity that it produces.

    system. This architecture can develop organically, usually in the early stages
    of a project, but after system growth and a few change requests, the need to think
    carefully about the architecture becomes more and more important. As the system
    becomes bigger, the structure becomes more difficult to change, which affects
    future efforts. It's easier to make changes following the structure rather than
    against the structure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a bad thing. Changes that *should* be made difficult could involve elements that
    need to be overseen by different teams or perhaps elements that can affect external
    customers. While the main focus is to create a system that's easy and efficient
    to change in the future, a smart architectural design will have a proper balance
    of ease and difficulty based on the requirements. Later in the chapter, we will
    study security as a clear example of when to keep certain operations difficult
    to implement.

    used to define the divisions between functions or other blocks. So, it can be
    applied in smaller and smaller scopes. It's turtles all the way down! But, from
    the point of view of architecture, the higher-level elements are the most important,
    as it's the higher level that defines the structure. Knowing how far to go in
    terms of detail is clearly important, but when taking an architectural approach,
    it is better to err on the "big picture" side rather than the "too much detail"
    one.

    but it could also be certain modules within a code base. For example, you could
    create a module that performs all the external HTTP calls and handles all the
    complexity of keeping connections, retries, handling errors, and so on, or you
    could create a module to produce reports in multiple formats, based on some parameters.

    the API needs to be clearly defined and the responsibility needs to be well defined.

    called a monolithic architecture. The LAMP architecture described above is an
    example of that, as most of the code is defined inside the web worker. Monoliths
    are the usual de facto starts of projects, as normally at the start there's no
    big plan and dividing things strictly into multiple components doesn't have a
    big advantage when the code base is small. As the code base and system grow more
    and more complex, the division of elements inside the monolith starts to make
    sense, and later it may start to make sense to split it into several components.

    In a very simple example, a company that has two big departments – say, purchases
    and sales – will tend to create two big systems, one focused on buying and another

    than communication within teams. Communication between teams would need to be
    more structured and require more active work. Communication inside a single group
    would be more fluid and less rigid. These elements are key for the design of a
    good software architecture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main thing for the successful application of any software architecture is
    that the team structure needs to follow the designed architecture quite closely.
    Trying to deviate too much will result in difficulties, as the tendency will be
    to structure, de facto, everything following group divisions. In the same way,
    changing the architecture of a system would likely necessitate restructuring the
    organization. This is a difficult and painful process, as anyone who has experienced
    a company reorganization will attest.

    different parts of the world, communication is also impacted. That's why it has
    become very common to set up different branches to take care of different elements
    of the system and to use detailed APIs to overcome the physical barriers of geographical
    distance. Communication improvements also have an effect on the capacity for collaboration,
    making remote work more effective and allowing fully remote teams to work closely
    together on the same code base.

    learning to work effectively in full-remote mode. Remember that Conway's Law is
    very much dependent on the communication dependencies of organizations, but communication

    to be 100 times more secure than, say, an internet forum for discussing cats.
    The most common example of this is the storage of passwords. The most naive approach
    to passwords is to store them, in plain text, associated with a username or email
    address – say, in a file or a database table. When the user tries to log in, we

    storing data from the user to keep privacy or reducing the data exposed in internal

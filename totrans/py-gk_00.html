			<p>Python is a multipurpose language that can be used for solving any medium to complex problems in several fields. <em class="italic">Python for Geeks</em> will teach you how to advance in your career with the help of expert tips and tricks.</p>
			<p>You'll start by exploring the different ways of using Python optimally, both from a design and implementation point of view. Next, you'll understand the lifecycle of a large-scale Python project. As you advance, you'll focus on different ways of creating an elegant design by modularizing a Python project and learn best practices and design patterns for using Python. You'll also discover how to scale out Python beyond a single thread and how to implement multiprocessing and multithreading in Python. In addition to this, you'll understand how you can not only use Python to deploy on a single machine but also using clusters in a private environment as well as in public cloud computing environments. You'll then explore data processing techniques, focus on reusable, scalable data pipelines, and learn how to use these advanced techniques for network automation, serverless functions, and machine learning. Finally, you'll focus on strategizing web development design using the techniques and best practices covered in the book.</p>
			<p>By the end of this Python book, you'll be able to do some serious Python programming for large-scale complex projects.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Prior knowledge of Python is a must to get real benefits from this book. You will need Python version 3.7 or later installed on your system. All code examples have been tested with Python 3.7 and Python 3.8 and expected to work with any future 3.x release. A Google Cloud Platform account (a free trial will work fine) will be helpful to deploy some code examples in the cloud. </p>

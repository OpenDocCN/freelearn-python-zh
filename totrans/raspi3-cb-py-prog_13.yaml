    computer is its ability to interface with and control hardware. In this chapter,
    we use Raspberry Pi to control remotely activated mains sockets, send commands
    over serial connections from another computer, and control the GPIO remotely.
    We make use of SPI (another useful protocol) to drive an 8 x 8 LED matrix display.

    to be transferred wirelessly between devices. Finally, we take control of USB
    devices by tapping into the commands sent over USB.

    default, A, which will slightly reduce the chance of someone else accidentally

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first script defines a class called `Switch`; it sets up the GPIO pins required
    to control the five relays (within the `setup` function). It also defines the
    `__enter__` and `__exit__` functions, which are special functions used by the
    `with..as` statement. When a class is created using `with..as`, it uses `__enter__`
    to perform any extra initialization or setup (if required), and then it performs
    any cleanup by calling `__exit__`. When the `Switch` class has been executed,
    all the relays are switched off to preserve the remote's battery and `GPIO.cleanup()`
    is called to release the GPIO pins. The parameters of the `__exit__` function
    (`type`, `value`, and `traceback`) allow the handling of any specific exceptions
    that may have occurred when the class was being executed within the `with..as`
    statement (if required).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To control the sockets, create two functions that will switch the relevant relays
    on or off to activate the remote control to send the required signal to the sockets.
    Then, shortly after, turn the relays off again using `clear()`. To make controlling
    the switches even easier, create a `message` function that will allow a switch
    number and state to be specified.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We make use of the `socketControl.py` script by creating a Tkinter GUI menu.
    The menu is made up of three sets of controls (one for each of the switches) that
    are defined by the `swButtons` class.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `swButtons` class creates a `Tkinter` button and two `Radiobutton` controls.
    Each `swButtons` object is given an index and a reference to the `mySwitches`
    object. This allows us to set a name for the button and control a particular switch
    when it is pressed. The socket is activated/deactivated by calling `message()`,
    with the required switch number and state set by the `Radiobutton` controls.

    to be put into it. To display a row of lights, we send the address of one of the

    In this chapter, we have used Raspberry Pi to control remotely activated mains
    sockets, to send commands over serial connections from another computer, and to
    control the GPIO remotely. We have also used SPI to drive an 8 x 8 LED matrix
    display.

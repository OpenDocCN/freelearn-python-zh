In this book, you'll learn how to use techniques and Python tools that reduce the effort involved in testing, and at the same time make it more useful—and even fun.</p><p>You'll learn about several of Python's automated testing tools, and you'll learn about the philosophies and methodologies that they were designed to support, like unit testing and test-driven development. When you're done, you'll be able to produce thoroughly tested code faster and more easily than ever before, and you'll be able to do it in a way that doesn't distract you from your "real" programming.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec01"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To use this book, you will need a working Python interpreter, preferably one of the 2.6 version series. You'll also need a source code editor, and occasional access to the internet. You will need to be comfortable enough using your operating system's textual interface—your DOS prompt or command shell—to do basic directory management and to run programs.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>If you are a Python developer and want to write tests for your applications, this book will get you started and show you the easiest way to learn testing.</p><p>You need to have sound Python programming knowledge to follow along. An awareness of software testing would be good, but no formal knowledge of testing is expected nor do you need to have any knowledge of the libraries discussed in the book.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find several headings appearing frequently.</p><p>To give clear instructions of how to complete a procedure or task, we use:</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Time for action – heading</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Action 1</li><li class="listitem">Action 2</li><li class="listitem">Action 3</li></ol></div><p>Instructions often need some extra explanation so that they make sense, so they are followed with:</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec01"/>
<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>This heading explains the working of tasks or instructions that you have just completed.</p><p>You will also find some other learning aids in the book, including:</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec02"/>Pop quiz – heading</h2></div></div></div><p>These are short multiple choice questions intended to help you test your own understanding.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec03"/>Have a go hero – heading</h2></div></div></div><p>These set practical challenges and give you ideas for experimenting with what you have learned.</p><p>You will also find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <code class="literal">include</code> directive."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows: </p><div><pre class="programlisting">...     if node.right is not None:
...         assert isinstance(node.right, AVL)
...         assert node.right.key &gt; node.key
...         right_height = node.right.height + 1</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">...     if node.right is not None:
<strong>...         assert isinstance(node.right, AVL)</strong>
...         assert node.right.key &gt; node.key
...         right_height = node.right.height + 1</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong># cp /usr/src/asterisk-addons/configs/cdr_mysql.conf.sample
     /etc/asterisk/cdr_mysql.conf</strong>
     </pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "clicking the Next button moves you to the next screen".</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div></div>

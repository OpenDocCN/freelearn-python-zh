  <div><h1 id="_idParaDest-4" class="Introduction-Title--PACKT-">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">Writing a book involves much more than the application of grammar and punctuation rules. In the same way, developing an application requires more than a knowledge of programming languages and library APIs. A mere mastery of syntax rules and function calls is not in itself sufficient for designing applications that empower users to perform work, safeguard valuable data, and produce flawless output. As programmers, we also need to be able to interpret user requests and expectations into effective interface designs and pick the best technologies to implement them. We need to be able to organize large code bases, test them, and maintain them in a way that keeps them manageable and free from careless errors.</p>
    <p class="normal">This book aims to be much more than a reference manual for a particular GUI toolkit. As we walk through a fictitious workplace scenario, you will get a taste of what it's like to be an application programmer in a small office environment. In addition to learning Tkinter and a few other useful libraries, you will learn many of the skills you need to move from being a writer of short scripts to a writer of fully-featured graphical applications. By the time you've finished the book, you should feel confident that you can develop a simple but useful data-oriented application for a working environment.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="title">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book is for beginners who have learned the basics of Python but haven't written much beyond simple scripts. We'll walk you step-by-step through designing and creating a larger application, and we'll introduce you to skills that will help you advance as a programmer.</p>
    <p class="normal">It's also aimed at those who have used Python for data science, web development, or system administration, but who now want to branch out into creating GUI applications. We'll go through the knowledge and skills required to create local GUI applications.</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, this book may also be useful for experienced Python programmers who just want to learn Tkinter, as much of the book details the finer points of using the Tkinter library.</p>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book expects that you know the basics of Python 3. You should know how to write and run simple scripts using built-in types and functions, how to define your own functions, and how to import modules from the standard library.</p>
    <p class="normal">You can follow this book on a computer running a current version of Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, or a distribution of GNU/Linux. Ensure that you have Python 3 and Tcl/Tk installed (<em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Tkinter</em>, contains instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux) and that you have a code editing environment with which you are comfortable (we suggest IDLE since it comes with Python and uses Tkinter. We do not recommend the use of Jupyter, Spyder, or similar environments aimed at analytical Python rather than application development). In the later chapters, you'll need access to the internet so that you can install Python packages and the PostgreSQL database.</p>

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-10" class="title">Conventions used</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
    <p class="normal"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CodeInText</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. For example: "Save the code in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">solve_the_worlds_problems.py</code> and execute it by typing <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">python solve_the_worlds_problems.py</code> at a terminal prompt."</p>
    <p class="normal">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">import tkinter as tk
root = tk.TK()
def solve():
  raise NotImplemented("Sorry!")
tk.Button(
  root, text="Solve the world's problems", command=solve
).pack()
root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, especially to indicate changes to existing code, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">import tkinter as tk
<strong class="hljs-keyword-slc">from</strong><strong class="hljs-slc"> tkinter </strong><strong class="hljs-keyword-slc">import</strong><strong class="hljs-slc"> messagebox</strong>
root = tk.TK()
def solve():
  <strong class="hljs-slc">messagebox.showinfo(</strong><strong class="hljs-string-slc">'The answer?'</strong><strong class="hljs-slc">, </strong><strong class="hljs-string-slc">'Bananas?'</strong><strong class="hljs-slc">)</strong>
tk.Button(
  root, text="Solve the world's problems", command=solve
).pack()
root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Note that all Python code in the book uses 2-space indents rather than the conventional 4-space indents.</p>
    <p class="normal">Any command-line input or output is written with a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">$</code> indicating the prompt, as follows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">$ mkdir Bananas
$ cp plantains.txt Bananas/
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Command line input intended for the Python shell or REPL is printed with a prompt of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, like so:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">&gt;&gt;&gt; print('This should be run in a Python shell')
'This should be run in a Python shell'
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Expected output from the shell is printed on a line with no prompt.</p>
    <p class="normal"><strong class="keyword">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes. For example: "Select <strong class="keyword">System info</strong> from the <strong class="keyword">Administration</strong> panel."</p>
    <div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
    </div>
    <div><p class="Tip--PACKT-"> Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-11" class="title">Executing Python and pip</h3>
    <p class="normal">When we need to instruct the reader to execute a Python script in this book, we indicate a command line such as the following:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">$ python myscript.py
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Depending on your operating system or Python configuration, the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">python</code> command may execute Python 2.x rather than Python 3.x. You can verify this by running the following command:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">$ python --version
Python 3.9.7
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">If this command outputs Python 2 rather than 3 on your system, you will need to alter any <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">python</code> commands so that your code is executed in Python 3. Typically, that means using the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">python3</code> command instead, like so:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">$ python3 myscript.py
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The same caveat applies to the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">pip</code> command used to install libraries from the Python Package Index. You may need to use the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">pip3</code> command instead to install libraries to your Python 3 environment, for example:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">$ pip3 install --user requests
</code></pre>

- en: Welcome to *Daniel Arbuckle's Mastering Python*. Python is a member of the C
    family of languages, such as C++ and Java; however, Python is more of a distant
    cousin, as the designers of Python are quite happy to do things in a different
    way if it seems better. Therefore, if you're familiar with C or one of its descendant
    languages, you'll find Python relatively familiar.

- en: The goal of this book is to help you move from being a Python newcomer to being
    able to use an assortment of advanced techniques. Along with C, C++, and Java,
    Python is one of the languages that everybody needs to know well. Python is, in
    my humble opinion, the best all-round language available and it's a whole lot
    of fun too!

    most part, each chapter is independent of the others. Feel free to skip around
    to the things that you need to learn, or work through the course in order to get
    up to speed. So, let's get you there.

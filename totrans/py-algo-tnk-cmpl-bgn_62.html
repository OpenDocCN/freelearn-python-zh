<b>[9]</b> William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (1824‐1907), was an Irish-born British mathematical physicist and engineer. He is widely known for developing the basis of absolute zero (the Kelvin temperature scale), and for this reason a unit of temperature measure is named after him. He discovered the Thomson effect in thermoelectricity and helped develop the second law of thermodynamics.

<b>[11]</b> Heron of Alexandria (c. 10‐c. 70 AD) was an ancient Greek mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and engineer. He is considered the greatest experimenter of ancient times. He described the first recorded steam turbine engine, called an “aeolipile” (sometimes called a "Hero engine"). Heron also described a method of iteratively calculating the square root of a positive number. Today, though, he is known best for the proof of “Heron's Formula” which finds the area of a triangle from its side lengths.

<b>[21]</b> Leonardo Pisano Bigollo (c. 1170‐c. 1250), also known as Fibonacci, was an Italian mathematician. In his book <i>Liber Abaci</i> (published in 1202), Fibonacci used a special sequence of numbers to try to determine the growth of a rabbit population. Today, that sequence of numbers is known as the Fibonacci sequence. He was also one of the first people to introduce the Arabic numeral system to Europe; this is the numeral system we use today, based on ten digits with a decimal point and a symbol for zero. Before then, the Roman numeral system was being used, making numerical calculations difficult.

- en: Explore the world of design principles and design patterns in the context of
    the Python programming language with this comprehensive guide. Learn about classic
    and modern design patterns and how to use them to solve problems you encounter
    daily as a Python developer or software architect.

- en: With code examples, real-world case studies, and detailed solution implementations,
    this book is a must-read for Python developers looking to elevate their coding
    skills. Co-authored by a Python expert with over two decades of experience, this
    new edition expands the scope to cover more design pattern categories. Gain insights
    into creational, structural, behavioral, architectural, and other important patterns
    for modern software design, such as concurrency, asynchronous, and performance
    patterns. Learn how to apply these patterns in various domains like event handling
    systems, concurrency, distributed systems, and testing. The book also presents
    Python anti-patterns, helping you avoid common pitfalls.

    pattern. Each chapter includes step-by-step instructions to test the code, making
    it an interactive learning experience. Where applicable, for each design principle
    or pattern, the book presents at least one real-world example, which may or may
    not be Python-based, and at least one Python-based example.

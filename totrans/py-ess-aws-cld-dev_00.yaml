- en: Cloud computing is one of the most popular approaches to implementing your applications,
    with huge advantages. There are multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, GCP, and
    Azure. AWS is one of the most used cloud providers, and many companies are moving
    there. Cloud usage is significantly growing and cloud knowledge is expected from
    developers.

- en: Most of the applications are moving to the cloud. AWS has different services
    to implement Python applications, hence the configuration and selecting the right
    service is a challenge for those who don’t have an AWS background. By buying this
    book, you are on the right path and stepping into how to implement cool Python
    applications using AWS services.

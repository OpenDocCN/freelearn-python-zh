    *Working with Analog Inputs and Local Storage*, we used a photoresistor that is
    included in a voltage divider and we connected it to an analog input pin. We were
    able to measure the ambient light and we determined different darkness levels
    and change the brightness levels of an RGB LED. The photoresistor, also known
    as **LDR** (short for **Light-Dependent Resistor**) or photocell, is a sensor.
    We just needed to include it in a voltage divider to make the changes in the resistance
    value of the photoresistor via the ambient light. These variations in the resistance
    value will generate changes in the voltage value in our analog pin. Thus, we worked
    with a configuration of electronic components that generated an analog sensor,
    capable of transforming changes in the environment light into voltage values.

    to write our own low level code to interact with the sensor with either the `mraa`
    or the `wiring-x86` library. As we will analyze later, depending on the connection

- en: '**Compatibility with Intel Galileo Gen 2 board and the voltage supply that
    we are using (5V or 3.3V)**: Sometimes, we have to wire more than one sensor to
    the board, and therefore, it is important to check whether all the sensors we
    are selecting can work with the voltage configuration we have for the board. Some
    sensors are only capable to work with the board if we have a specific setting.'

- en: '**Power consumption**: We must take into account that some sensors have different
    working modes. For example, some sensors have a high performance mode that requires
    more power than a normal mode. As we might work with more than one sensor wired
    to the board, it is also important to consider the overall power consumption with
    all the sensors connected to the board and in the modes in which we will use them.
    In addition, some sensors switch to power saving modes when we don''t use them.'

  zh: '**功耗**：我们必须考虑到一些传感器具有不同的工作模式。例如，一些传感器具有高性能模式，需要比正常模式更多的电力。由于我们可能会将多个传感器连接到板上，因此考虑所有传感器连接到板上并使用我们将在其中使用的模式时的整体功耗也很重要。此外，一些传感器在我们不使用它们时，会切换到省电模式。'
- en: '**Connection type**: We need to answer a few questions in order to decide the
    most convenient connection type. Do we have the necessary connections, communications
    or interface ports? Are they available? Do the connection type and the distance
    we need have any impact on the accuracy for the measured values? In addition,
    when we select the first sensor for our board, all the connections might be available,
    but the situation changes as we add more sensors and it can force the decision
    to select a sensor with a different connection type. Let''s consider the following
    situation, we are already measuring ambient light in 6 different positions. We
    have 6 photoresistors connected with 6 voltage divider configurations and wired
    to the 6 available analog input pins, and therefore, we don''t have additional
    analog pins available. If we have to add a temperature sensor, we cannot add an
    analog sensor that requires an analog input pin because all of them are wired
    to the light sensors. In this case, we have to use a digital temperature sensor
    that we can wire to either the I²C or the SPI buses. Another option is to use
    a digital temperature sensor that we can wire to the UART port. We will dive deep
    on the different connection types for the sensors later.'

    ranges. For example, a temperature sensor measuring ambient temperature can have
    a measurement range of -40ºF to 185ºF (equivalent to -40ºC to 85ºC). In case we
    need to measure ambient temperatures that can reach 90ºC, we have to select a
    temperature sensor with a higher upper range. For example, another sensor that
    measuring ambient temperature provides a measurement range of -40ºF to 257ºF (equivalent
    to -40ºC to 125ºC) will be suitable for this job.'

    configurable precision levels. We have to make sure the accuracy provided by the
    sensor is compatible with our needs. As the measured value changes, it is important
    to consider the sensitivity, also known as measurement resolution. For example,
    if we have to measure temperature and we must be able to determine changes of
    at least 2ºF or 1ºC based on the unit of measure we are using, we have to make
    sure that the sensor is capable providing the required sensitivity.'

    sensor to gather a new value and whether it is capable of providing us with a
    real new value in this amount of time. When the measure value changes in the real
    environment or object that we are measuring, the sensor takes some time to be
    able to provide us with the new measured value. Sometimes, they are microseconds
    but in other cases, they can be milliseconds or even seconds. It depends on the
    sensor and we have to take it into account when selecting the appropriate sensor
    for our project. For example, we might need a temperature sensor to allow us to
    measure 2 temperature values per second, and therefore, we must work with a sensor
    with a latency lower than 500 milliseconds (0.5 seconds) to achieve our goal.
    Specifically, we can select a temperature sensor with a latency of 200 milliseconds.
    Unluckily, sometimes we have to dive deep on the datasheets to check the latency
    value for some sensors and the electronic components that it uses.'

    that the sensor is supported in the `upm` library. In other cases, we have to
    make sure that we have the necessary Python libraries to work with the protocols
    that some digital sensors use. For example, many temperature sensors that work
    with the UART port use the MODBUS serial communications protocol. If they aren''t
    supported in the `upm` library, we have to work with specific Python libraries
    to establish communications using the MODBUS serial communications protocol and

- en: In this chapter, we learned about sensors and their connection types. We understood
    that it is necessary to consider many important things when choosing sensors and
    that they make it easy for us to measure different variables from the real world.
    We learned the importance of considering the units of measure because sensors
    always provide values measured in a specific unit that we must consider.

- en: We wrote code that took advantage of the modules and classes included in the
    `upm` library that made it easier for us to start working with analog and digital
    sensors. In addition, we wrote code that interacted with a digital accelerometer
    through the I²C bus because we wanted to be able to take advantage of additional
    features provided by the sensor but not included in the `upm` library module.

- en: We measured the magnitude and direction of proper acceleration or g-force, ambient
    temperature and humidity. As in the previous chapters, we continued taking advantage
    of Python's object-oriented features and we created classes to encapsulate sensors
    and the necessary configurations with the `upm` and `mraa` libraries. Our code
    is easy to read and understand and we can easily hide the low-level details.

    make our IoT device perform actions with different actuators and shields, which
    is the topic of the next chapter.

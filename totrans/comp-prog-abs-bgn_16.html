			<p>The code examples in this book have, for the most part, been written using pseudocode, as the aim of the book is to give you an understanding of what programming is, rather than focusing on any particular language.</p>
			<p>To be able to write code, you will need to use a real language, and here we will look at some of the more popular ones and see how the code used in this book would translate into these languages.</p>
			<p>The languages we will look at are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>Python</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For each language, we will start with a short introduction. </p>
			<p>You will not be able to start to write your very own programs just from these short examples, but you will get a feel for these languages, and maybe seeing them like this will help you decide what language you want to learn first.</p>
			<p>Before we look at the different languages, we will have a couple of pseudocode examples. These examples will then be translated into the preceding six languages. So, let's begin!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>The pseudocode examples</h1>
			<p>In this section, we will look into a<a id="_idIndexMarker849"/> few code examples for pseudocode.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Hello world in pseudocode</h2>
			<p>The first example will be a <a id="_idIndexMarker850"/>short program that just prints <strong class="bold">Hello, World!</strong> to the screen.</p>
			<p>In our pseudocode, it will look<a id="_idIndexMarker851"/> like this:</p>
			<pre>print "Hello, World!"</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Variables declaration in pseudocode</h2>
			<p>In this example, we will create a<a id="_idIndexMarker852"/> couple of variables. The first one will store an integer. The second one will store the value from the first one but <a id="_idIndexMarker853"/>converted into a string:</p>
			<pre>my_int_value = 10
my_string_value = string(my_int_value)</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>The for loop in pseudocode</h2>
			<p>In this example, we<a id="_idIndexMarker854"/> will have a <code>for</code> loop that iterates 10 times and prints the <a id="_idIndexMarker855"/>values <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>:</p>
			<pre>for i = 0 to 10
    print i
end_for</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>Functions in pseudocode</h2>
			<p>In this example, we will create a <a id="_idIndexMarker856"/>small function that will accept three integers as<a id="_idIndexMarker857"/> arguments. The function should then return the largest of them. We will also call the function and display the result.</p>
			<p>In the function, we first check whether the first argument is larger than the two others. If it is, we have found the largest value, and we return it.</p>
			<p>As we do a return as soon as we find the largest value, we will not need to use any <code>else</code> statements in this program as a return will exit the function immediately.</p>
			<p>We will, therefore, only need to compare the second argument with the third. If the second is larger than the third, we<a id="_idIndexMarker858"/> return it; otherwise, we will return the third argument as it <a id="_idIndexMarker859"/>must be the largest value. This is shown with the following code:</p>
			<pre>function max_of_three(first, second, third)
   if first &gt; second and first &gt; third then
        return first
    end_if
    if second &gt; third then
         return second
    end_if
    return third
end_function
maximum = max_of_three(34, 56, 14)
print maximum</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>while loops, user input, if, and for loops in pseudocode</h2>
			<p>In this example, we will illustrate<a id="_idIndexMarker860"/> several concepts at the same time.</p>
			<p>This program <a id="_idIndexMarker861"/>will ask the user to<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> enter numbers, as many as they want. They can stop entering new values by entering a negative number. All values, except the final negative one, will be <a id="_idIndexMarker863"/>stored in a dynamic array. </p>
			<p>Before<a id="_idIndexMarker864"/> the program exists, we <a id="_idIndexMarker865"/>will print all the values that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker866"/>stored with the following code block:</p>
			<pre>values = [] 
inputValue = 0 
while inputValue &gt;= 0
    print "Enter a number: "
    input inputValue 
    if inputValue &gt;= 0
        values.add(inputValue)
    end_if
end_while</pre>
			<p>From the preceding code, we see that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we create a dynamic array. Remember that this is a list in which we can add and remove values during the program execution; that is, it is not a fixed-size array for which we will need to define how many items we want to store in it:</li>
				<li>We will then enter a <code>while</code> loop, and inside it, ask the user for a number. </li>
				<li>We will add the <a id="_idIndexMarker867"/>entered number to the dynamic array and will keep doing<a id="_idIndexMarker868"/> that until the user enters a negative <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>number. This negative number should <a id="_idIndexMarker870"/>not be <a id="_idIndexMarker871"/>added to the array, but instead, it will <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>act as an indication that the user is done entering <a id="_idIndexMarker873"/>numbers so we can exit the loop.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>C++</h1>
			<p>C++ was developed by Bjarne <a id="_idIndexMarker874"/>Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, and he initially called it C with Classes. The work began in 1979, and he wanted to create a language that had the power of the C programming language and the object-oriented features he had been exposed to when programming for his Ph.D. thesis. </p>
			<p>In 1982, he renamed the language C++, where the two addition operators are a reference to the ++ operator in C, which increments a variable by one. The idea is that C++ is C with one thing added, and that thing is object-orientation.</p>
			<p>The first commercial release of the language was in 1985.</p>
			<p>C++ is a general-purpose compiled programming language that is often used in situations requiring high execution speed, where the programmer is in control over how data is stored and managed in the computer's memory.</p>
			<p>Here are some quick facts about it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: C++</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Designed by</strong>: Bjarne<a id="_idIndexMarker875"/> Stroustrup</li>

			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor218"/>Hello world in C++</h2>
			<p>All applications that are<a id="_idIndexMarker876"/> written in C++ need to have a function called <code>main</code> that will act as the starting point for program execution.</p>
			<p>The output is shown to the <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>console window by using what is known as an output stream. The language provides a ready-made object from the <code>ostream</code> class for this purpose, called <code>cout</code>. The language also provides a function (this type of function is known as a manipulator<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> function in C++) called <code>endl</code>, which will add a newline character to the output stream. Data is sent to the output stream using the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator.</p>
			<p>The <code>std::</code> part in front of <code>cout</code> and <code>endl</code> indicates that these two are defined in the standard namespace of the language.</p>
			<p>As the <code>main</code> function in C++ should return an integer value that indicates the result of the execution, we return <code>0</code>, which is the value representing success.</p>
			<p>Note that all non-compound statements in C++ end with a semicolon, as follows:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    return 0;
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor219"/>Variable declaration in C++</h2>
			<p>As C++ is a statically typed language, we <a id="_idIndexMarker879"/>must specify what data type a variable can use. After<a id="_idIndexMarker880"/> that, this will be the only data type this variable can handle.</p>
			<p>Strings in C++ are defined in a class, and to be able to use that class, we must include <code>string</code>, as we do in the first line.</p>
			<p>Inside the main function, we first declare our integer variable. We specify that the type is an integer with <code>int</code>.</p>
			<p>Then, we want to convert our integer into a string. We can do that with the help of a function called <code>to_string</code>. It is defined in the standard namespace and must be preceded by <code>std::</code>.</p>
			<p>When declaring the type for the <code>string</code> variable, we must also state that the <code>string</code> class is located in the standard namespace:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;string&gt;
int main()
{
    int my_int_value = 10;
    std::string my_string_value = std::to_string(my_int_value);
    return 0;
}</pre>
			<p>We can, if we want to, simplify this program and let the compiler figure out what type the variables will have. The <code>auto</code> keyword will help us with this. As we are assigning a value to the variables as we create them, they will be of the same type as the data we assign to them. Refer to the following<a id="_idIndexMarker881"/> code:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;string&gt;
int main()
{
    auto my_int_value = 10;
    auto my_string_value = std::to_string(my_int_value);
    return 0;
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>The for loop in C++</h2>
			<p>C++ uses the C style of <code>for</code> loops. It has three<a id="_idIndexMarker882"/> sections, separated by a semicolon, as <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>shown here:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
}</pre>
			<p>From the preceding code, we see the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first section will initialize the loop variable to its starting value; in our case, that will be <code>0</code>.</li>
				<li>The next section is the condition that will tell us for how long the <code>for</code> loop will run; in our case, that is as long as the variable is less than 10.</li>
				<li>The final section is how the variable will change in each iteration. We are using the <code>++</code> operator here so that the variable will increase by one each iteration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Inside the loop, we will print the <a id="_idIndexMarker884"/>value of the loop variable.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Functions in C++</h2>
			<p>A function in C++ must first state its<a id="_idIndexMarker885"/> return type – that is, what data type the function returns. We must also specify the type each argument has. In our case, we will pass in<a id="_idIndexMarker886"/> three integers, and as the function will return one of them, the return type will also be an integer.</p>
			<p>Note that in C++, the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> symbols means <code>and</code>:</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int max_of_three(int first, int second, int third) 
{
    if (first &gt; second &amp;&amp; first &gt; third) {
        return first;
    }
    if (second &gt; third) {
        return second;
    }
    return third;
}
int main()
{
    int maximum = max_of_three(34, 56, 14);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; maximum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>while loops, user input, if statements, and foreach loops in C++</h2>
			<p>We need to<a id="_idIndexMarker887"/> use a dynamic data <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>structure so we can add as many values as we like while the program is running. One such option we have in C++ is to use a class called <code>vector</code>. This class is created such <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>that it can hold data of any type, and that is<a id="_idIndexMarker890"/> why we have <code>int</code> between <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> in the declaration. Let's see how this works:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">As with so many other things, the <code>vector</code> class needs to be specified as belonging to the <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>standard namespace with <code>std::</code>.</li>
				<li>Next, we declare the<a id="_idIndexMarker892"/> integer variable that will accept the input. We will set it to <code>0</code> for now. We need that value on the next line when we enter our <code>while</code> loop. As the loop iterates, as long as <code>input_value</code> is equal to or greater than <code>0</code>, we must set it to a value within that range.</li>
				<li>Inside the loop, we print a message to the user that we require a value. To get input from the user, we use <code>cin</code>, which works a bit like <code>cout</code> but in reverse. Instead of sending things to the screen, it accepts things from the keyboard. Usually, when we talk about <code>cout</code> and <code>cin</code>, we don't say that the output goes to the screen and the input comes from the keyboard, as these can be remapped to be other things such as files. Instead, we say that <code>cout</code> goes to the standard output, which is usually the screen, and <code>cin</code> reads from the standard input, which is usually the keyboard.</li>
				<li>When we have the input, we check whether it is <code>0</code> or a positive value. These are the only ones that we want to store in our vector. If it is, we use a method called <code>push_back</code> on our vector, which will insert the current value into the vector at the end.</li>
				<li>This will continue until the user enters a negative value. Then, we exit the <code>while</code> loop and enter <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>something that is called a <code>for</code> loop in C++. It is like a <code>foreach</code> loop in that it <a id="_idIndexMarker894"/>will iterate through all the items<a id="_idIndexMarker895"/> we have in the vector. The current item<a id="_idIndexMarker896"/> will be <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>stored in the variable<a id="_idIndexMarker898"/> value, and inside the loop, we<a id="_idIndexMarker899"/> print it. The <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>code for it<a id="_idIndexMarker901"/> is here:<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
int main()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; values;
    int input_value = 0;
    while (input_value &gt;= 0) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a number: ";
        std::cin &gt;&gt; input_value;
        if (input_value &gt;= 0) {
            values.push_back(input_value);
        }
    }
    
    for (auto value : values) {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
} </pre></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>C#</h1>
			<p>C#, pronounced like the musical <a id="_idIndexMarker902"/>note with the same name, is a language developed by Microsoft and was first released in 2000 as a part of the company's .NET initiative. The language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, a Danish software engineer, who first called it <strong class="bold">Cool</strong> (for <strong class="bold">C-like Object-Oriented Language</strong>). Microsoft renamed it<a id="_idIndexMarker903"/> before its first official release for copyright reasons.</p>
			<p>The language is designed to be a simple, modern, and object-oriented programming language. The language is primarily used within Microsoft's .NET Framework.</p>
			<p>Note that all non-compound <a id="_idIndexMarker904"/>statements in C# end with a semicolon.</p>
			<p>Here are some quick facts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: C#</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Designed by</strong>: Anders Hejlsberg, Microsoft</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">First public release</strong>: 2000</li>

				<li><code>.cs</code></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-218"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Hello world in C#</h2>
			<p>All programs written in C# must exist within a class, and <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>one class in our project must<a id="_idIndexMarker906"/> have a method called <code>Main</code> that will be the starting point for the program execution. It should also be noted that all C# applications should exist within a project.</p>
			<p>The first thing we should note is that the first thing we see on the line containing the <code>Main</code> method header is the <code>static</code> keyword. Declaring a method as <code>static</code> means that it can execute without the need to create an object of the class it is defined in. Simply put, this means that the <code>Main</code> method can be executed as a function; that is all we need to know at this point.</p>
			<p><code>Console</code> is a class that handles all the input and output for console applications in C#. A console application is a program that does not have a graphical user interface. All input and output is done through a console or terminal window, using just text.</p>
			<p>Inside the <code>Console</code> class, there is another static method called <code>WriteLine</code>. Here we can see that a <code>static</code> method can be called using the class name. This method, <code>WriteLine</code>, will output whatever we<a id="_idIndexMarker907"/> send to the console window. Refer to the following code:</p>
			<pre>using System;
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-219"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Variable declaration in C#</h2>
			<p>As C# is a statically typed language, we <a id="_idIndexMarker908"/>must specify what data type a variable can use. After<a id="_idIndexMarker909"/> that, this will be the only data type this variable can handle.</p>
			<p>We declare the <code>myIntValue</code> variable as an integer using <code>int</code>.</p>
			<p>In C#, <code>int</code> is not just a primitive data type, as in many other languages. It is something called a <code>struct</code>. A <code>struct</code> is, in a way, the same thing as a class. This <code>struct</code> will inherit things from a class called <code>Object</code>, and this class defines a method called <code>ToString</code> that we can use to convert the integer into a string:</p>
			<pre>using System;
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int myIntValue = 10;
        string myStringValue = myIntValue.ToString();
    }
}</pre>
			<p>We can simplify this program by letting the compiler figure out what data type the variables will have. As we are assigning a value to them as we declare them, the compiler will<a id="_idIndexMarker910"/> create them as that data <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>type. We do this with the help of the <code>var</code> keyword:</p>
			<pre>using System;
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var myIntValue = 10;
        var myStringValue = myIntValue.ToString();
    }
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>The for loop in C#</h2>
			<p>C# uses the C-style of <code>for</code> loop. It has three sections, separated by a semicolon:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first section<a id="_idIndexMarker912"/> will initialize the loop<a id="_idIndexMarker913"/> variable to its starting value; in our case, that will be <code>0</code>. </li>
				<li>The next section is the condition that will tell us for how long the <code>for</code> loop will run; in our case, that is as long as the variable is less than 10. </li>
				<li>The final section is how the variable will change in each iteration. We are using the <code>++</code> operator here so that the variable will increase by one each iteration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Inside the loop, we will print the value of the loop variable:</p>
			<pre>using System;
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) 
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine(i);
        }
    }
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Functions in C#</h2>
			<p>The first thing <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>we should note<a id="_idIndexMarker915"/> is that in C#, there are no functions as all code must be defined within a class, and functions that are declared inside a <a id="_idIndexMarker916"/>class are called <strong class="bold">methods</strong>. They do behave like normal functions, though.</p>
			<p>As we saw in earlier examples, if we want to call a method without having an object of this class, the method must be declared <code>static</code>, and that is the first thing we see on the line where we declare the function.</p>
			<p>In C#, we must also specify what data type a method will return. That is why it says <code>int</code> in front of the method name. It will return an integer as we pass in three integers, and it will return the largest<a id="_idIndexMarker917"/> of the three. As we can see, we must also state the data type for each of the arguments.</p>
			<p>Note that in C#, the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> symbols means <code>and</code>. Refer to the following code:</p>
			<pre>using System;
class Program
{
    static int MaxOfThree(int first, int second, int third)
    {
        if (first &gt; second &amp;&amp; first &gt; third) {
            return first;
        }
        if (second &gt; third) {
            return second;
        }
        return third;
    }
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int maximum = MaxOfThree(34, 56, 14);
        System.Console.WriteLine(maximum);
    }
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>while loops, user input, if statements, and foreach loops in C#</h2>
			<p>We need to use a<a id="_idIndexMarker918"/> dynamic data structure so we can add as many values as we like while the program is running. One such <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>option we have in C# is to<a id="_idIndexMarker920"/> use a class called <code>List</code>: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>This class is created so<a id="_idIndexMarker921"/> a list can hold data of any type, and that is why we have <code>int</code> between <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> in the declaration.</li>
				<li>Next, we declare the<a id="_idIndexMarker922"/> integer variable that will accept the input. We set it to <code>0</code> for now. We need that value on the next line when we enter our <code>while</code> loop. As the loop<a id="_idIndexMarker923"/> iterates as long as <code>inputValue</code> is equal to or greater than <code>0</code>, we must set it to a value within that range.</li>
				<li>Inside the loop, we <a id="_idIndexMarker924"/>print a message to the user that we want a value. To get input from the user, we use the <code>ReadLine</code> method that is located in the <code>Console</code> class. The value we get from <code>ReadLine</code> is a string. That is why we use the <code>Int32.Parse</code> method. It will convert whatever the user enters into an integer.</li>
				<li>When we have the input, we<a id="_idIndexMarker925"/> check whether it is <code>0</code> or a positive value. It is only <code>0</code> values that we want to<a id="_idIndexMarker926"/> store in our list. If it is, we use a method call <code>Add</code> on our list, which will insert the current value into the list at the end.</li>
				<li>This will continue until the user enters a<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> negative value. Then, we exit the <code>while</code> loop and enter a <code>foreach</code> loop, which will iterate through all the items in the list. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The current item will be stored in the variable value, and inside the loop, we print it:</p>
			<pre>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
class Program
{
   static void Main(string[] args)
   {
      List&lt;int&gt; values = new List&lt;int&gt;();
      int inputValue = 0;
      while (inputValue &gt;= 0) {
          System.Console.Write("Enter a number: ");
          inputValue = Int32.Parse(System.Console.ReadLine());
          if (inputValue &gt;= 0) {
              values.Add(inputValue);
           }
      }
      foreach(var value in values) {
          System.Console.WriteLine(value);

			<p>Work on the Java<a id="_idIndexMarker928"/> programming language started in 1991, and the design goals were to create a simple, object-oriented language with a syntax that was familiar to existing programmers.</p>
			<p>James Gosling was the leading designer behind the language, and he initially named it Oak, as an oak tree was growing outside his window. For copyright reasons, it was later renamed Java after the Java coffee.</p>
			<p>An essential concept in the design of the language was to let programmers write once and run anywhere, abbreviated to <em class="italic">WORA</em>. The idea is<a id="_idIndexMarker929"/> that an application written in Java can run on most platforms without any modification or recompilation.</p>
			<p>The portability was achieved by letting the Java source code<a id="_idIndexMarker930"/> compile into an intermediate representation, called <em class="italic">Java byte code</em>, instead of platform-specific machine code. The byte code is then executed by a virtual machine that is written for the hardware hosting the application.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Hello world in Java</h2>
			<p>Java requires all code to be written within<a id="_idIndexMarker931"/> a class, and all applications need one <a id="_idIndexMarker932"/>class that has a method called <code>main</code>.</p>
			<p>One peculiarity of Java is that every class must be written in a source code file that has the same name as the class. As the class in this example is named <code>Hello</code>, it must be saved in a file called <code>Hello.java</code>.</p>
			<p>To print something to a console window, we will be using <code>System.out.println</code>. Now, <code>System</code> is a class that, among other things, handles input and output. Inside the <code>System</code> class, an output stream is defined, called <code>out</code>, and this stream has a method named <code>println</code>, which prints the data passed to it and terminates by inserting a newline character at the end of the stream.</p>
			<p>Note that all non-compound<a id="_idIndexMarker933"/> statements in Java end with a semicolon:</p>
			<pre>class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");        
    }
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Variable declaration in Java</h2>
			<p>As Java is a statically<a id="_idIndexMarker934"/> typed language, we must specify what data type a <a id="_idIndexMarker935"/>variable can use. After that, this will be the only data type this variable can handle.</p>
			<p>We first declare our integer variable using <code>int</code>. </p>
			<p>All primitive data types have a class representation in Java. We can use the <code>Integer</code> class to convert our integer to a string. We do that by calling a static method in the <code>Integer</code> class and passing the integer value we want to be converted to it:</p>
			<pre>class Variable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int myIntValue = 10;
        String myStringValue = Integer.toString(myIntValue);       
    }
}</pre>
			<p>Java does not have a feature for automatic type deduction, like the <code>auto</code> and <code>var</code> keywords we find in C++ and C#.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>The for loop in Java</h2>
			<p>Java uses the C-style of <code>for</code> loops. It has<a id="_idIndexMarker936"/> three sections, separated by semicolons. The first section will initialize the loop variable to its starting value; in our case, that will be 0. The next section is the condition that will tell us for how long the <code>for</code> loop will run; in our <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>case, that is as long as the variable is less than 10. The final section is how the variable will change in each iteration. We are using the ++ operator here, so that the variable will increase by one each iteration.</p>
			<p>Inside the loop, we will print the value of the loop variable:</p>
			<pre>class For {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }  
    }
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Functions in Java</h2>
			<p>The first thing we should <a id="_idIndexMarker938"/>note is that in Java, there are no functions as all code must be defined within a class, and functions that are declared inside a class are called methods. They do<a id="_idIndexMarker939"/> behave like normal functions, though.</p>
			<p>As we saw in earlier examples, if we want to call a method without having an object of this class, the method must be declared as <code>static</code>, and that is the first thing we see on the line where we declare the function.</p>
			<p>In Java, we must also specify what data type a method will return. That is why it says <code>int</code> in front of the method name. It will return an integer as we pass in three integers, and it will return the largest of the three. As we can see, we must also state the data type for each of the arguments.</p>
			<p>Note that in Java, the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> symbols means <code>and</code>:</p>
			<pre>class Function {
    static int maxOfThree(int first, int second, int third) {
        if (first &gt; second &amp;&amp; first &gt; third) {
            return first;
        }
        if (second &gt; third) {
            return second;
        }
        return third;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int maximum = maxOfThree(34, 56, 14);
        System.out.println(maximum);
    }
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>while loops, user input, if statements, and foreach loops in Java</h2>
			<p>We need to use a dynamic data <a id="_idIndexMarker940"/>structure <a id="_idIndexMarker941"/>so that <a id="_idIndexMarker942"/>we can add as many values<a id="_idIndexMarker943"/> as we like while the program is running. One <a id="_idIndexMarker944"/>such option we <a id="_idIndexMarker945"/>have in Java is to<a id="_idIndexMarker946"/> use a class called <code>ArrayList</code>: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">This class is created so a list can hold data <a id="_idIndexMarker947"/>of any type, and that is why we have <code>Integer</code> between <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> in the declaration. In Java, we cannot use a primitive data type as the type to store in the list. Instead, we use the class representation of <code>int</code>, which is <code>Integer</code>.</li>
				<li>Next, we declare the integer variable that will accept the input. We set it to <code>0</code> for now. We need that value on the next line when we enter our <code>while</code> loop. As the loop iterates as long as <code>inputValue</code> is equal to or greater than 0, we must set it to a value within that range.</li>
				<li>Java does not have a built-in method for user input, so we need to create an object from a class called <code>BufferedReader</code> that can handle the input. We call this object <code>reader</code>.</li>
				<li>Inside the loop, we print a message to the user that we want a value. To get input from the user, we use our <code>reader</code> object and its <code>readLine</code> method. The value we get from <code>readLine</code> is a string. That is why we use the <code>Integer.parseInt</code> method. It will convert<a id="_idIndexMarker948"/> whatever the user enters into an integer.</li>
				<li>When we have the input, we<a id="_idIndexMarker949"/> check whether it is <code>0</code> or a positive value. It is only <code>0</code> values that<a id="_idIndexMarker950"/> we want to store in our list. If it is, we use a method called <code>add</code> on our list that will insert the current value into the list at the end.</li>
				<li>Java will force us to handle the<a id="_idIndexMarker951"/> event of the user entering something other than a number. If they do, we will get an exception when we try to convert the string<a id="_idIndexMarker952"/> to a number. That is why we need the <code>try</code> block with a <code>catch</code> statement. If the user enters anything other than numbers, we will enter the <code>catch</code> statement.</li>
				<li>This will continue <a id="_idIndexMarker953"/>until the user enters a negative value. Then, we<a id="_idIndexMarker954"/> exit the <code>while</code> loop and enter a <code>for</code> loop that will iterate through all the items in the list. The current<a id="_idIndexMarker955"/> item will be stored in the <code>value</code> variable, and inside the loop, we<a id="_idIndexMarker956"/> print it:<pre>import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.ArrayList;
class For {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; values = new 
      ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    int inputValue = 0;
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new 
                     InputStreamReader(System.in));
    while(inputValue &gt;= 0) {
      System.out.print("Enter a value: ");
      try {
        inputValue = Integer.parseInt(reader.readLine());
        if (inputValue &gt;= 0) {
          values.add(inputValue);
        }
      } catch (NumberFormatException | IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
      }
    }
    for (int value : values) {

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>JavaScript</h1>
			<p>In the early years of the <a id="_idIndexMarker957"/>World Wide Web, there was only one web browser with support for a graphical user interface, namely Mosaic, released in 1993. The lead developers of Mosaic soon started the Netscape corporation and released a more polished browser called Netscape Navigator in 1994.</p>
			<p>The web was a very different place in these early years, and web pages could only display static content. Netscape wanted to change this and decided to add a scripting language to its Navigator. At first, they looked at two options for how to achieve this. One was to collaborate with Sun Microsystems and use the Java programming language. The other option was to let the newly hired Brendan Eich embed the Scheme programming language into the browser.</p>
			<p>The decision was a compromise between the two. Brendan Eich was tasked with creating a new language, but its syntax should be closely related to Java and less like Scheme. The language was first named LiveScript, and that was the name it was released under in 1995. </p>
			<p>As Java was the brand new language at the time, the name was changed to JavaScript so it could get more attention. The similarity in names between the two languages has led to much confusion over the years, especially among people not so familiar with programming.</p>
			<p>Here are some quick facts about JavaScript:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: JavaScript</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Designed by</strong>: Brendan Eich</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">First public release</strong>: 1995</li>

				<li><code>.js </code></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Hello world in JavaScript</h2>
			<p>The first thing we should note about<a id="_idIndexMarker958"/> JavaScript is that it is designed to have its programs executed within a web browser. You can run JavaScript applications in a console<a id="_idIndexMarker959"/> window, but to be able to do that, we will need a JavaScript engine that can execute the code for us. One such engine is Node.js, which can be<a id="_idIndexMarker960"/> downloaded for free from <a href="https://nodejs.org">https://nodejs.org</a>.</p>
			<p>JavaScript is a scripting language, so we will not need to put our code within any particular function or class. </p>
			<p>In JavaScript, we can use the <code>console</code> object to output data. It is usually used to print data to a web browser's debugging console, but if we use Node.js to execute that application, the output will be printed to the console window. The <code>console</code> object has a method called <code>log</code> that will output anything we pass to it.</p>
			<p>Note that all non-compound statements in JavaScript end with a semicolon:</p>
			<pre>console.log("Hello, World!");</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Variable declaration in JavaScript</h2>
			<p>JavaScript does not have<a id="_idIndexMarker961"/> a specific data type for integers. Instead, it has a data type called <code>Number</code> that handles both integer and floating-point numbers.</p>
			<p>We declare variables <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>either by using the older <code>var</code> keyword or the newer <code>let</code>.</p>
			<p>As JavaScript is dynamically typed, we will not need to specify what type a variable will use. This will be inferred automatically when we assign a value to it.</p>
			<p>Converting a number into a string can be done with a method in the <code>Number</code> class called <code>toString</code>. As our variable, <code>myIntValue</code>, is an object from the <code>Number</code> class, it has such a method. Note that we are passing the value <code>10</code> to the <code>toString</code> method. This is the base we want the number to be in. We want a decimal number, so we pass <code>10</code>. This is done as follows:</p>
			<pre>let myIntValue = 10;
let myStringValue = myIntValue.toString(10);</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>The for loop in JavaScript</h2>
			<p>JavaScript uses the C style of <code>for</code> loops. It has<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> three sections, separated by semicolons: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first section will initialize<a id="_idIndexMarker964"/> the loop variable to its starting value; in our case, that will be <code>0</code>. </li>
				<li>The next section is the condition that will tell us for how long the <code>for</code> loop will run; in our case, that is as long as the variable is less than <code>10</code>. </li>
				<li>The final section is how the variable will change in each iteration. We are using the <code>++</code> operator here, so that the variable will increase by one each iteration.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Inside the loop, we will print the value of the loop variable:</p>
			<pre>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Functions in JavaScript</h2>
			<p>As JavaScript is dynamically typed, we <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>will not need to specify any data type for<a id="_idIndexMarker966"/> the return value of the function or for the arguments as we need to do in C++, C#, and Java.</p>
			<p>We use the <code>function</code> keyword to define that this is a function.</p>
			<p>Note that in JavaScript, the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> symbols mean <code>and</code>:</p>
			<pre>function maxOfThree(first, second, third) {
  if (first &gt; second &amp;&amp; first &gt; third) {
    return first;
  }
  if (second &gt; third) {
    return second;
  }
  return third;
}
let maximum = maxOfThree(34, 56, 14);
console.log(maximum);</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>while loops, user input, if statements, and foreach loops in Java</h2>
			<p>First of all, we <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>must note<a id="_idIndexMarker968"/> that this example will not do JavaScript justice, as JavaScript is not created to write<a id="_idIndexMarker969"/> applications like<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> this one. This <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/>has to do<a id="_idIndexMarker972"/> with JavaScript being designed<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/> to run within a web browser and <a id="_idIndexMarker974"/>not as console applications. </p>
			<p>In JavaScript, things are often done asynchronously. That is, the program code will not run in sequence as we are used to in most other languages and situations. If we try to implement this program in the same way as the pseudocode version and the version written for all other<a id="_idIndexMarker975"/> languages, we will see that it goes into an endless loop just asking us to enter a value, over and over again.</p>
			<p>This program is somewhat <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>complicated, so let's not go into too much detail. The first lines are there to create something that will handle the input. At the heart of it is a function called <code>question</code> that will return a <code>promise</code> object. A <code>promise</code> object is something that promises to<a id="_idIndexMarker977"/> give us a value at some point in the future. To be able to use this <code>promise</code>, it must be called from a function, and that function must be<a id="_idIndexMarker978"/> declared as <code>async</code>. This means that this function can use the <code>promise</code> (to simplify things somewhat). </p>
			<p>This function does not have a name, but as you can see, it is surrounded by parentheses and has two empty parentheses at the very end. This construct will make this function execute immediately:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Inside this function, we create a dynamic array called <code>values</code>. We will initialize it to be empty, as we don't have any values to store in it yet. </li>
				<li>Next, we find the variable we will use for our input. We set this to <code>0</code> so that when we come to the <code>while</code> loop on the next line, we will enter the loop.</li>
				<li>On the next line, we will use all the code we see at the top of the program, which handles the user input. We say that we <code>await</code> the <code>question</code> function. The <code>await</code> keyword will let the application go and do some other things if it needs to, but when we get a value entered by the user, we will come back here and resume execution. That is a<a id="_idIndexMarker979"/> short description of how asynchronous calls <a id="_idIndexMarker980"/>work. This is an advanced topic, so if this code confuses you, no problem. </li>
				<li>If the value entered is greater<a id="_idIndexMarker981"/> than or equal to <code>0</code>, we push this value to the back of our array.</li>
				<li>When the user enters a<a id="_idIndexMarker982"/> negative number, we exit the <code>while</code> loop and enter a <code>for</code> loop that will iterate as many times as there are items in the array. The <code>pos</code> variable will have an index value, <code>0</code> the first time, <code>1</code> the second time, and so on. When we want to<a id="_idIndexMarker983"/> print the values<a id="_idIndexMarker984"/> inside the loop, we can use this value as<a id="_idIndexMarker985"/> an index into the array, so<a id="_idIndexMarker986"/> that we get the first value the first time, the second time, and so on. Refer to the following <a id="_idIndexMarker987"/>code:<pre>const readline = require("readline");
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});
const question = (q) =&gt; {
  return new Promise((res, rej) =&gt; {
    rl.question(q, (answer) =&gt; {
      res(answer);
    });
  });
};
(async () =&gt; {
  let values = [];
  let inputValue = 0;
  while (inputValue &gt;= 0) {
    inputValue = await question("Enter a number: ");
    inputValue = parseInt(inputValue);
    if (inputValue &gt;= 0) {
      values.push(inputValue);
    }
  }
  for (let pos in values) {
    console.log(values[pos]);
  }
})();</pre></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>PHP</h1>
			<p>In 1994, Rasmus Lerdorf, a Danish-Canadian programmer, wrote several <strong class="bold">Common Gate Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">CGI</strong>) programs in C. CGI is<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> an interface specification that will let web servers execute programs that can generate dynamic<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> web content. Lerdorf created this for his private web page and extended and added functionality to handle web forms and database communication. He named the project <strong class="bold">Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter</strong>, abbreviated to <strong class="bold">PHP/FI</strong>.</p>
			<p>Lerdorf has later admitted that he<a id="_idIndexMarker990"/> never intended to create a new programming language, but the project got a life of its own, and a development team was formed, and in 1997 PHP/FI 2 was released. </p>
			<p>The language is primarily used on web servers to create dynamic web content.</p>
			<p>Here are some quick facts on it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: PHP</li>

			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Hello world in PHP</h2>
			<p>The primary use of PHP is to run alongside a<a id="_idIndexMarker991"/> web server, and applications written in PHP will most often be<a id="_idIndexMarker992"/> used to produce dynamic web content. But we can run PHP applications as standalone console applications if we download the PHP<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> executable from <a href="https://php.net">https://php.net</a>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>As PHP code can be written in the same document as HTML code, all PHP source code that we write must be within <code>php</code> tags. The opening tag is <code>&lt;?php</code> and the closing tag is <code>?&gt;</code>.</li>
				<li>We use <code>echo</code> to display our message in the console window. You will not need to use any parentheses with <code>echo</code>, as it is not a function but a language construct.<p>Note that all non-compound<a id="_idIndexMarker994"/> statements in PHP end with a <a id="_idIndexMarker995"/>semicolon:</p><pre>&lt;?php
 echo "Hello, World!";
?&gt;</pre></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Variable declaration in PHP</h2>
			<p>As PHP is a <a id="_idIndexMarker996"/>dynamically typed language, we will not need to provide any implicit information<a id="_idIndexMarker997"/> on what data type to use when we declare variables. The variable type will be deducted automatically for us, and the type we end up with depends on what we assign to the variable.</p>
			<p>An oddity that PHP has inherited from the language Perl is that all variable names must start with a dollar sign. In Perl, this had a meaning as different signs identified different types, but PHP only has the dollar sign for all types.</p>
			<p>Let's try this. We first assign the value <code>10</code> to our <code>$myIintValue</code> variable. </p>
			<p>To convert this integer into a string, we will use a <code>strval</code> function and pass the integer to it. This will <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>convert this value into a string, as shown here:</p>
			<pre>&lt;?php
 $myIntValue = 10;
 $myStringValue = strval($myIntValue);
?&gt;</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>The for loop in PHP</h2>
			<p>PHP uses the C style of <code>for</code> loops. It has<a id="_idIndexMarker999"/> three sections, separated by semicolons. The first section will initialize the loop variable<a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/> to its starting value; in our case, that will be <code>0</code>. The next section is the condition that will tell us for how long the <code>for</code> loop will run; in our case, that is as long as the variable is less than 10. The final section is how the variable will change in each iteration. We are using the <code>++</code> operator here so that the variable will increase by one each iteration.</p>
			<p>Inside the loop, we will print the value of the loop variable.</p>
			<p>As <code>echo</code> in PHP will not provide any newline character, we will need to append it after our loop variable in each iteration. We can concatenate the value of the loop variable and the newline character (<code>\n</code>) by inserting a period between the two:</p>
			<pre>&lt;?php
 for($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
     echo $i . "\n";
 }
?&gt;</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Functions in PHP</h2>

$maximum = maxOfThree(34, 56, 14);
echo $maximum;
  
?&gt;</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>while loops, user input, if statements, and foreach loops in PHP</h2>
			<p>In PHP, we can create <a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/>a dynamic array by using <code>array()</code>. An array in PHP is not an array but an<a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/> ordered map, in other languages known<a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/> as a dictionary or<a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/> an associative<a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/> array. But for this application, this does not matter:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">After the array is<a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/> created, we declare the input variable that will hold the values the user enters. We set it to <code>0</code>, so when we come to the <code>while</code> loop on the<a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/> next line, we will enter the loop. </li>
				<li>Next, we will use <code>readline</code> to get a value from the user. We can pass a string to <code>readline</code>, and that string will be printed to the screen as a prompt to the user. This way, we will not have a separate line that prints this message.</li>
				<li>The value we get from <code>readline</code> will be a string, so we use <code>intval</code> to convert it to an integer.</li>
				<li>Next, we check whether the value is greater than or equal to <code>0</code>. If it is, we will use the <code>array_push</code> function. This function takes two arguments. The first one is the array into which we want to push a value, and the second argument is the value we want to be pushed.</li>
				<li>When the user enters a<a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/> negative number, we will exit the <code>while</code> loop and enter a <code>foreach</code> loop that will print all the values the user entered. If you compare this program<a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/> with the ones written for the other languages, you will see that the array and the variable have switched<a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/> placed in PHP compared to the others.<p>Inside the <code>foreach</code> loop, we print the<a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/> values to the console:</p><pre>&lt;?php
 $values = array();
 $inputValue = 0;
 while($inputValue &gt;= 0) {
     $inputValue = intval(readline("Enter a value: "));
     if($inputValue &gt;=  0) {
         array_push($values, $inputValue);
     }
 }
 foreach($values as $value) {
     echo $value . "\n";
 }

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Hello world in Python</h2>
			<p>As Python is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/>scripting language, we will not need to put our code within any special function or class. To<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> print a message to the console window, we will just use the <code>print</code> function and pass whatever we want to print to it:</p>
			<pre>print("Hello, World!")</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Declaring variables in Python</h2>
			<p>As Python is a dynamically typed language, we will not need to provide any information on what type our<a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/> variables will use. That will be deducted automatically for us when we assign a value to the variable.</p>
			<p>To declare an integer<a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/> variable, we just assign an integer to it.</p>
			<p>To convert this integer to a string, we can use a class called <code>str</code> and pass the integer to it. As everything in Python is an object, this will return a new string object to us:</p>
			<pre>my_int_value = 10
my_string_value = str(my_int_value)</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>The for loop in Python</h2>
			<p>When it comes to <code>for</code> loops, Python will be <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/>different from all the other languages we look at here. It does not implement a <code>for</code> loop that uses the C-style format. A <code>for</code> loop in <a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/>Python will iterate over a sequence of some sort. As we don't have any sequence, we can use something called <code>range</code>. Now, <code>range</code> looks like a function, but in reality, it is something that is called a <code>10</code>, at the first iteration, it will generate the value <code>0</code>. In the next iteration, the generated value will be <code>1</code>, and so on up to <code>9</code>.</p>
			<p>Also, note that Python does not use braces to indicate a compound statement, as we can see in this <code>for</code> statement. Instead, the content of the <code>for</code> loop is indented with four spaces. Also, note the colon as the last character on the first line. It is an indication that the next line should be indented:</p>
			<pre>for i in range(10):
    print(i)</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Functions in Python</h2>
			<p>As Python is<a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/> dynamically typed, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/>will not need to specify any data type for the return value of the function or for the arguments as we need to do in C++, C#, and Java.</p>
			<p>We use the <code>def</code> keyword to define that this is a function:</p>
			<pre>def max_of_three(first, second, third):
    if first &gt; second and first &gt; third:
        return first
    if second &gt; third:
        return second
    return third
maximum = max_of_three(34, 56, 14)
print(maximum)</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>while loops, user input, if statements, and foreach loops in Python</h2>
			<p>In Python, we can use<a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/> a list to store the values the user enters. A list in Python is dynamic, so<a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/> it can grow <a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/>as the user enters new <a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/>values:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">We declare the list <a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/>and make it empty, to start with.</li>
				<li>Next, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/> declare the variable<a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/> we will use for<a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/> the user input and set it to <code>0</code>. The reason we use zero is so that when we come to the line with the <code>while</code> loop, we want the condition to be true. It will be true if the <code>input_value</code> variable is <code>0</code> or greater.</li>
				<li>Inside the <code>while</code> loop, we will use the <code>input</code> function to let the user enter values. The <code>input</code> function lets us pass a string to it, and that string will be displayed to the user. This takes away the need we have in some other languages to actually print this message first and then get the user input.</li>
				<li>The value we get from the <code>input</code> function is a string, so we need to convert it to <code>int</code>. We do that by passing the entered string to <code>int()</code>. This will create an integer with the value entered.</li>
				<li>Next, we check whether the entered<a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/> value is greater<a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/> than or equal to <code>0</code>. If it is, we will append it to our list.<p>When the user enters<a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/> a negative number, we will exit the <code>while</code> loop and continue to a <code>for</code> loop. <code>for</code> loops in Python always work like <code>foreach</code> loops. A <code>for</code> loop wants a sequence, and it will go<a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/> through all the values of that sequence. Our list is such <a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/>a sequence, so <a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/>we will get one item<a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/> each time we iterate, and we can now print<a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/> that item value, as shown here:</p><pre>values = []
input_value = 0
while input_value &gt;= 0:
    input_value = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if input_value &gt;= 0:
        values.append(input_value)
for value in values:
    print(value)</pre></li>

- en: Over the last few years, the boom that the World has experienced with the Internet
    breakthrough has pushed almost every programming language or platform to welcome
    the rise of web development toolkits, libraries, and frameworks.

- en: The Python programming language has grown a rather large list of these environments
    though apart from a few of them such as Zope and Twisted most have a fairly small
    community. It is in this context that CherryPy came into existence when Rémi Delon,
    its creator, decided that he needed a tool that would work as he wanted for his
    own personal projects. He then released CherryPy under a free software license
    so that anyone could use, distribute, and contribute to the project.

- en: CherryPy is a Python library implementing the HTTP protocol, which is at the
    very core of the Web, using common Python idioms. On top of that CherryPy offers
    its own view and concepts on how to help a developer to build web applications
    while being minimally intrusive through its own simple and straightforward API.

- en: This book will guide you through the CherryPy library with the aim of giving
    you the key to make the best of it in your own web applications.

- en: The first four chapters are dedicated to CherryPy, providing information ranging
    from its history to an in-depth presentation of its key features. The rest of
    the book will then take you into the development of a photoblog application. Each
    chapter tries to provide enough background to allow you to ponder the why and
    how of each decision made. Indeed writing software applications is not a precise
    science and compromises need to be undertaken for the better, however, the truth
    is that writing software usually does not go quite as planned. I have written
    this book with the hope that in the end you would have learnt much more than using
    a Python library.

    application, which will be the unifying theme for the rest of the book. The chapter
    reviews the basic entities that the application will manipulate before moving
    onto explaining how we will map them into a relational database. This will allow
    us to explain the concept of ORM and perform a quick comparison between SQLAlchemy,
    SQLObject, and Dejavu.'

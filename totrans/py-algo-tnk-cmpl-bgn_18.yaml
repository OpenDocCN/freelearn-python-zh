  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sequence control structure refers to the line-by-line execution by which statements
    are executed sequentially, in the same order in which they appear in the program,
    without skipping any of them. They might, for example, carry out a series of read
    or write operations, arithmetic operations, or assignments to variables.

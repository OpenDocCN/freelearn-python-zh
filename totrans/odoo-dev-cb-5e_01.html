			<h1 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Installing the Odoo Development Environment</h1>
			<p>To begin our Odoo development journey, we must set up our development environment by installing Odoo using source code that we can use to enhance, debug, and improve our development skills. There are several ways to set up an Odoo development environment, but this chapter proposes the best of them. You will find several other tutorials on the web explaining the other approaches. Keep in mind that this chapter is about setting up a development environment that has different requirements from a production environment; production has different parameters we must set in the config file, as per the volume of data and number of users in the system. We will cover configuration file parameters and their usage in this chapter.</p>
			<p>If you are new to Odoo development, you must know about certain aspects of the Odoo ecosystem. The first recipe will give you a brief introduction to the Odoo ecosystem, after which we will install Odoo for development purposes.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the Odoo ecosystem</li>
				<li>Installing Odoo from the source</li>
				<li>Managing Odoo server databases</li>
				<li>Storing the instance configuration in a file</li>
				<li>Activating Odoo developer tools</li>
				<li>Updating the add-on modules list</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>All the code that’s used in this chapter can be downloaded from this book’s GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Odoo-17-Development-Cookbook-Fifth-Edition/tree/main/Chapter01">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Odoo-17-Development-Cookbook-Fifth-Edition/tree/main/Chapter01</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Understanding the Odoo ecosystem</h1>
			<p>Odoo provides developers with out-of-the-box modularity and its powerful framework helps them build projects quickly. There are various characters in the Odoo ecosystem that you should <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>be familiar with before embarking on your journey of becoming a successful Odoo developer.</p>
			<p>Let’s assume you have a system with 4 CPU cores, 8 GB of RAM, and 30 concurrent Odoo users.</p>
			<p>To determine the number of workers needed, divide the number of users by 6. In this case, 30 users divided by 6 equals 5, which is the theoretical number of workers required.</p>
			<p>To calculate the theoretical maximum number of workers, multiply the number of CPU cores by 2 and add 1. For 4 CPU cores, (4 * 2) + 1 equals 9, which is the theoretical maximum number of workers.</p>
			<p>Based on these calculations, you can use 5 workers for the Odoo users and an additional worker for the cron worker, making a total of 6 workers.</p>
			<p>To estimate the RAM consumption, use the following formula:</p>
			<p><code>RAM = Number of workers * ((0.8 * 150) + (0.2 * </code><code>1024))</code></p>
			<p>In this case, 6 workers multiplied by <code>((0.8 * 150) + (0.2 * 1024))</code> equals approximately 2 GB of RAM.</p>
			<p>Therefore, based on these calculations, the Odoo installation will require around 2 GB of RAM.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Odoo editions</h2>
			<p>Odoo comes in two <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>different editions. The first one is <strong class="bold">Community Edition</strong>, which is open source, while the second one is <strong class="bold">Enterprise Edition</strong>, which has licensing fees. Unlike other software vendors, Odoo Enterprise Edition is just a pack of extra applications that adds extra features or new apps to the Community Edition. The Enterprise Edition runs on top of the Community Edition. The Community <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>Edition comes under the <strong class="bold">Lesser General Public License v3.0</strong> (<strong class="bold">LGPLv3</strong>) and comes with all of the basic <strong class="bold">enterprise resource planning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ERP</strong>) applications, such as sales, <strong class="bold">customer relationship management</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>), invoicing, purchases, and a website builder. Alternatively, the <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>Enterprise Edition comes with the Odoo <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>Enterprise Edition license, which is a proprietary license. Odoo <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>Enterprise Edition has <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>several advanced features, such as full accounting, studio, <strong class="bold">Voice over Internet Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">VoIP</strong>), mobile responsive design, e-sign, marketing <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>automation, delivery and banking integrations, <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>), and more. The Enterprise Edition also provides you with unlimited <em class="italic">bugfix support</em>. The following diagram shows that the Enterprise Edition depends on the Community Edition, which is why you need the latter to use the former:</p>

			<p>You can find a full comparison of both editions here: <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/editions">https://www.odoo.com/page/editions</a>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Odoo has the largest number of community developers among all open source ERPs on the market with 20K+ forks on GitHub, hence why you will find a large number of third-party apps (modules) on the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>app store. Some of the free apps use an <strong class="bold">Affero General Public License version 3</strong> (<strong class="bold">AGPLv3</strong>). You cannot use the proprietary license on your app if your application has dependencies on such apps. Apps with an Odoo proprietary license can only be developed on modules that have LGPL or other proprietary licenses.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Git repositories</h2>
			<p>The entire code base of Odoo is hosted on GitHub. You can post bugs/issues for stable versions here. You <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>can also propose a new feature by submitting a <strong class="bold">pull request</strong> (<strong class="bold">PR</strong>). There are <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>several repositories in Odoo. See the following table for more information:</p>

			<p>Every year, Odoo releases a major release, which is a long-term support version that will last for 3 years, and a few <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>minor versions. Minor versions are mostly used in Odoo’s online <code>master</code> branch is under development and is unstable, so it is advisable not to use this for production since it might break your database.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Runbot</h2>
			<p>Runbot is Odoo’s automated testing environment. Whenever there is a new commit in Odoo’s GitHub branch, Runbot pulls those latest changes and creates the builds for the last four commits. Here, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>test all stable and in-development branches. You can even play with the Enterprise Edition and its development branches.</p>
			<p>Every build has a different background color, which indicates the status of the test cases. A green background color means that all of the test cases run successfully and you can test that branch, while a red background color means that some test cases have failed on this branch and some features might be broken on that build. You can view the logs for all test cases, which show exactly what happens during installation. Every build has two databases. The <code>all</code> database has all of the modules installed on it, while the <code>base</code> database only has base Odoo modules installed. Every build is installed with basic demo data, so you can test it quickly without extra configurations.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>access Runbot at <a href="http://runbot.odoo.com/runbo">http://runbot.odoo.com/runbo</a>t.</p>
			<p>The following credentials can be used to access any Runbot build:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Odoo app store</h2>
			<p>Odoo launched <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>the app store a few years back, and it was an instant hit. At the time of writing, over 39,000+ different apps are hosted there. You will find lots of free and paid applications for different versions here. This includes specific solutions for different business verticals, such as education, food industries, and medicine. It also includes apps that extend or add new features to existing Odoo applications. The app store also provides numerous beautiful themes for the Odoo website builder. In <a href="B20997_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Odoo Add-On Modules</em>, you will learn how to set pricing and currency for your custom module.</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Odoo has open sourced several themes after version 13 and now works with an advanced JavaScript called <em class="italic">OWL</em>. We will cover this in <a href="B20997_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor929"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>. Note that these were paid themes in previous versions. This means that, in Odoo versions 15 and 16, you can download and use those beautiful themes at no extra cost.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Odoo Community Association</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Odoo Community Association</strong> (<strong class="bold">OCA</strong>) is a non-profit organization that develops/manages community-based Odoo modules. All OCA modules are open source and maintained <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>by Odoo community members. OCA’s GitHub account contains multiple repositories for different Odoo applications. Apart from Odoo modules, it also contains various tools, a migration library, accounting localizations, and so on.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Official Odoo help forum</h2>
			<p>Odoo has a very powerful framework, and tons of things can be achieved just by using/activating <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>options or by following specific patterns. Consequently, if you run into some technical issues or if you are not sure about some complex cases, then you can post your query on Odoo’s official help forum. Lots of developers are active on this forum, including some official Odoo employees.</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>search for questions or post your new questions by going to <a href="https://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1">https://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Odoo’s eLearning platform</h2>
			<p>Recently, Odoo has launched a new eLearning platform. This platform provides lots of videos that <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>explain how to use different Odoo applications. At the time of writing, this platform does not have technical videos, just functional ones.</p>
			<p>Here is the <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>URL for Odoo’s eLearning platform: <a href="https://www.odoo.com/slides">https://www.odoo.com/slides</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Installing Odoo from the source</h1>
			<p>It is highly <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>recommended that you use the <strong class="bold">Linux Ubuntu</strong> operating system to install Odoo since this is the operating system that Odoo uses for all its tests, debugging, and installations <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>of Odoo Enterprise. Additionally, most Odoo developers use GNU/Linux distributions, so they are much more likely to get support from the Odoo community for operating system-level <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>issues that occur in <strong class="bold">GNU/Linux</strong> than <em class="italic">Windows</em> or <em class="italic">macOS</em>.</p>
			<p>It is also recommended to develop Odoo add-on modules using the same environment (the same distribution and the same version) as the one that will be used in production. This will avoid nasty surprises, such as discovering on the day of deployment that a library has a different version than expected, with a slightly different and incompatible behavior. If your <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>workstation is using a different operating system, a good approach is to set up a <strong class="bold">virtual machine</strong> (<strong class="bold">VM</strong>) on your workstation and install a GNU/Linux distribution in the VM.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Ubuntu is available <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>as an app in the <strong class="bold">Microsoft Store</strong>, so you can use that if you don’t want to switch to Ubuntu.</p>
			<p>For this book, we will be using Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, but you can use any other Debian GNU/Linux operating system. Whatever Linux distribution you choose, you should have some notion of how to use it from the command line, and knowing about system administration will certainly not do any harm.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Getting ready</h2>
			<p>We are assuming that you have Ubuntu 22.04 up and running and that you have an account with <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>root access or that <code>sudo</code> has been configured. In the following sections, we will install Odoo’s dependencies and download Odoo’s source code from GitHub.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Some of the configurations require a system login username, so we will use <code>$(whoami)</code> whenever a login username is required in a command line. This is a shell command that will substitute your login in the command you are typing.</p>
			<p>Some operations will be easier if you have a GitHub account. If you don’t have one already, go to <a href="https://github.com">https://github.com</a> and create one.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>How to do it...</h2>
			<p>To install Odoo from the source, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Run the following commands to install the main dependencies:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ sudo apt-get update</strong>
<strong class="bold">$ sudo apt install openssh-server fail2ban python3-pip python3-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev libjpeg8-dev liblcms2-dev libblas-dev libatlas-base-dev git curl python3-venv python3.10-venv fontconfig libxrender1 xfonts-75dpi xfonts-base -y</strong></pre></li>				<li>Download and install <strong class="bold">wkhtmltopdf</strong>:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ wget https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6.1-2/wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb</strong>
<strong class="bold">$ sudo dpkg -i wkhtmltox_0.12.6.1-2.jammy_amd64.deb</strong></pre><p class="list-inset">If you encounter any errors after running the previous command, force install the dependencies with the following command:</p><pre class="source-code"><strong class="bold">$ sudo apt-get install -f</strong></pre></li>				<li>Now, install <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>the PostgreSQL database:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ sudo apt install postgresql -y</strong></pre></li>				<li>Configure PostgreSQL:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ sudo -i -u postgres createuser -s  $(whoami)</strong>
<strong class="bold">$ sudo su postgres</strong>
<strong class="bold">$ psql</strong>
<strong class="bold">alter user $(whoami) with password 'your_password';</strong>
<strong class="bold">\q</strong>
<code>git</code>:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"</strong>
<strong class="bold">$ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com</strong></pre></li>				<li>Clone the Odoo code base:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ mkdir ~/odoo-dev</strong>
<strong class="bold">$ cd ~/odoo-dev</strong>
<code>odoo-17.0</code> virtual environment and activate it:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ python3 -m venv ~/venv-odoo-17.0</strong>
<code>venv</code>:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ cd ~/odoo-dev/odoo/</strong>
<strong class="bold">$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt</strong></pre></li>				<li>Create and <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>start your first Odoo instances:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ createdb odoo-test</strong>
<code>http://localhost:8069</code> and authenticate it by using the <code>admin</code> account and using <code>admin</code> as the password.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you need RTL support, please install <code>node</code> and <code>rtlcss</code> by running <code>sudo apt-get install nodejs npm -y sudo npm install -</code><code>g rtlcss</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>How it works...</h2>
			<p>In <em class="italic">step 1</em>, we installed <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>several core dependencies. These dependencies include <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>various tools, such as <strong class="bold">git</strong>, <strong class="bold">pip3</strong>, <strong class="bold">wget</strong>, Python setup tools, and more. These core <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>tools will help us install other Odoo dependencies using simple commands.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">step 2</em>, we downloaded and installed the <code>wkhtmltopdf</code> package, which is used in Odoo to print PDF documents such as sale orders, invoices, and other reports. Odoo 17.0 needs version 0.12.6.1 of <code>wkhtmltopdf</code>, and that exact version might be not included in the current Linux distributions. Fortunately for us, the maintainers of <code>wkhtmltopdf</code> provide pre-built packages for various distributions at <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html">http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html</a> and we have downloaded and installed it from that URL.</p>
			<p>After this, we configured PostgreSQL, which is used for Odoo’s database management.</p>
			<h3>PostgreSQL configuration</h3>
			<p>In <em class="italic">step 3</em>, we installed the PostgreSQL database.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">step 4</em>, we created a <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>new database user with the login name of our system. <code>$(whoami)</code> is used to fetch your login name, and the <code>-s</code> option is used to give superuser rights. Let’s see why we need these configurations.</p>
			<p>Odoo uses the <code>psycopg2</code> Python library to connect with a PostgreSQL database. To access a PostgreSQL database with the <code>psycopg2</code> library, Odoo uses the following values by default:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>By default, <code>psycopg2</code> tries to connect to a database with the same username as the current user on local connections, which enables password-less authentication (this is good for the development environment)</li>
				<li>The local connection uses Unix domain sockets</li>
				<li>The database server listens on port <code>5432</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>That’s it! Your PostgreSQL database is now ready to be connected with Odoo.</p>
			<p>As this is a development server, we have given <code>--superuser</code> rights to the user. It is OK to give the PostgreSQL user more rights as this will be your development instance. For a production instance, you can use the <code>--createdb</code> command line instead of <code>--superuser</code> to restrict rights. The <code>–superuser</code> rights in a production server will give additional leverage to an attacker exploiting a vulnerability in some part of the deployed code.</p>
			<p>If you want to use a database user with a different login, you will need to provide a password for the user. This is done by passing the <code>--pwprompt</code> flag on the command line when creating the user, in which case the command will prompt you for the password.</p>
			<p>If the user has already been created and you want to set a password (or modify a forgotten password), you can use the following command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ psql -c "alter role $(whoami) with password 'newpassword'"</pre>			<p>If this command fails with an error message saying that the database does not exist, it is because you did not create a database named after your login name in <em class="italic">step 4</em> of this recipe. That’s fine; just add the <code>--dbname</code> option with an existing database name, such as <code>--</code><code>dbname template1</code>.</p>
			<h3>Git configuration</h3>
			<p>For the development environment, we are using Odoo sourced from GitHub. With <code>git</code>, you can easily <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>switch between different Odoo versions. Note that you can fetch the latest changes with the <code>git </code><code>pull</code> command.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">step 5</em>, we configured our <code>git</code> user.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">step 6</em>, we downloaded the source code from Odoo’s official GitHub repository. We used the <code>git clone</code> command to download Odoo’s source code. We used a single branch as we only wanted a branch for the 17.0 version. We also used <code>--depth 1</code> to avoid downloading the full commit history of the branch. These options will download the source code very quickly, but if you want, you can omit those options.</p>
			<p>Odoo developers also propose nightly builds, which are available as tarballs and distribution packages. The main advantage of using <code>git clone</code> is that you will be able to update your repository when new bug fixes are committed in the source tree. You will also be able to easily test any proposed fixes and track regressions so that you can make your bug reports more precise and helpful for developers.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you have access to the Enterprise Edition source code, you can download that in a separate folder under the <code>~/</code><code>odoo-dev</code> directory.</p>
			<h3>Virtual environments</h3>
			<p>Python <strong class="bold">virtual environments</strong>, or <strong class="bold">venvs</strong> for short, are isolated Python workspaces. These are <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>very useful to Python developers because they allow different workspaces with different versions of various Python libraries to be installed, possibly on different Python interpreter versions.</p>
			<p>You can create as many environments as you wish using the <code>python3 -m venv ~/newvenv</code> command. This will create a <code>newvenv</code> directory in the specified location, containing a <code>bin/</code> subdirectory and a <code>lib/python3.10</code> subdirectory.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">step 7</em>, we created a new virtual environment in the <code>~/venv-odoo-17.0</code> directory. This will be our isolated Python environment for Odoo, and all of Odoo’s Python dependencies will be installed in this environment.</p>
			<p>To activate the <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>virtual environment, we need to use the <code>source</code> command. We used the <code>source ~/venv-odoo-17.0/bin/activate</code> command to activate the virtual environment.</p>
			<h3>Installing Python packages</h3>
			<p>Odoo’s source code has a list of Python dependencies in <code>requirements.txt</code>. In <em class="italic">step 8</em>, we installed <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>all those requirements via the <code>pip3 </code><code>install</code> command.</p>
			<p>That’s it. Now, you can run the Odoo instance.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Starting the instance</h2>
			<p>Now comes the moment you’ve been waiting for. To start our first instance, in <em class="italic">step 9</em>, we created a <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>new empty database, used the <code>odoo-bin</code> script, and then started the Odoo instance with the following command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
python3 odoo-bin -d odoo-test -i base --addons-path=addons --db-filter=odoo-test$</pre>			<p>You can also omit <code>python3</code> by using <code>./</code> before <code>odoo-bin</code> as it is an executable Python script:</p>
			<pre class="console">
./odoo-bin -d odoo-test -i base --addons-path=addons --db-filter=odoo-test$</pre>			<p>With <code>odoo-bin</code>, a script with the following command-line arguments is used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>-d database_name</code>: Use this database by default.</li>
				<li><code>--db-filter=database_name$</code>: Only try to connect to databases that match the supplied regular expression. One Odoo installation can serve multiple instances that live in separate databases, and this argument limits the available databases. The trailing <code>$</code> is important as the regular expression is used in match mode. This enables you to avoid selecting names starting with the specified string.</li>
				<li><code>--addons-path=directory1,directory2,...</code>: This is a comma-separated list of directories in which Odoo will look for add-ons. This list is scanned at instance creation time to populate the list of available add-on modules in the instance. If you want to use Odoo’s Enterprise Edition, then add its directory with this option.</li>
				<li><code>-i base</code>: This is used to install a base module. This is required when you have created a database via the command line.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are using a <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>database user with a database login that is different from your Linux login, you need to pass the following additional arguments:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>--db_host=localhost</code>: Use a TCP connection to the database server</li>
				<li><code>--db_user=database_username</code>: Use the specified database login</li>
				<li><code>--db_password=database_password</code>: This is the password for authenticating against the PostgreSQL server</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To get an overview of all available options, use the <code>--help</code> argument. We will see more of the <code>odoo-bin</code> script later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>When Odoo is started on an empty database, it will create the database structure that’s needed to support its operations. It will also scan the add-on path to find the available add-on modules and insert some into the initial records in the database. This includes the <code>admin</code> user with the default <code>admin</code> password, which you will use for authentication.</p>
			<p>Pointing your web browser to <code>http://localhost:8069/</code> leads you to the login page of your newly created instance, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Managing Odoo server databases</h1>
			<p>When working <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>with Odoo, all the data in your instance is stored in a PostgreSQL database. All the standard database management tools you are used to are available, but Odoo also proposes a web interface for some common operations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Getting ready</h2>

			<p>The Odoo database management interface provides tools to create, duplicate, remove, back up, and restore a database. There is also a way to change the master password, which is used <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>to protect access to the database management interface.</p>
			<h3>Accessing the database management interface</h3>
			<p>To access <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>the database, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the login screen of your instance (if you are authenticated, log out).</li>
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Manage Databases</strong>. This will navigate you to <a href="http://localhost:8069/web/database/manager">http://localhost:8069/web/database/manager</a> (you can also point your browser directly to that URL):</li>

Refer to the next recipe for more information about the configuration file.</p>
			<h3>Creating a new database</h3>
			<p>This dialog <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>box can be used to create a new database instance that will be handled by the current Odoo server. Follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>On the database management screen, click on the <strong class="bold">Create Database</strong> button, which can be found at the bottom of the screen. This will bring up the following dialog:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B20997_01_7.0.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7 – The Create Database dialog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.7 – The Create Database dialog</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Fill in <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>the form, as follows:<ul><li><strong class="bold">Master Password</strong>: This is the master password for this instance.</li><li><strong class="bold">Database Name</strong>: Input the name of the database you wish to create.</li><li><strong class="bold">Email</strong>: Add your email address here; this will be your username later.</li><li><strong class="bold">Password</strong>: Type in the password you want to set for the admin user of the new instance.</li><li><strong class="bold">Phone Number</strong>: Set your phone number (optional).</li><li><strong class="bold">Language</strong>: Select the language that you wish to be installed by default in the <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>new database in the drop-down list. Odoo will automatically load the translations for the selected language.</li><li><strong class="bold">Country</strong>: Select the country of the main company in the drop-down list. Selecting this will automatically configure a few things, including the company’s currency.</li><li><strong class="bold">Demo data</strong>: Check this box to obtain demonstration data. This is useful for running interactive tests or setting up a demonstration for a customer, but it should not be checked for a database that is designed to contain production data.</li></ul></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you wish to use the database to run automated tests for the modules (refer to <a href="B20997_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor363"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Debugging Modules</em>), you need to have the demonstration data since the vast majority of the automated tests in Odoo depend on these records to run successfully.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Click <strong class="bold">Continue</strong> and wait until the new database is initialized. After, you will be redirected to the instance and connected as the administrator.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Troubleshooting</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are redirected to a login screen, this is probably because the <code>filter</code> option. Note that the <code>odoo-bin start</code> command does this silently, making only the current database available. To work around this, simply restart Odoo without the <code>start</code> command, as shown in the <em class="italic">Installing Odoo from the source</em> recipe. If you have a configuration file (refer to the <em class="italic">Storing the instance configuration in a file</em> recipe later in this chapter), check that the <code>db_filter</code> option is unset or set to a value matching the new database name.</p>
			<h3>Duplicating a database</h3>
			<p>Often, you will have an existing database, and you will want to experiment with it to try a procedure <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>or run a test, but without modifying the existing data. The solution here is simple: duplicate the database and run the test on the copy. Repeat this as many times as required:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>On the database management screen, click on the <strong class="bold">Duplicate Database</strong> link next to the name of the database you wish to clone:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B20997_01_8.0.jpg" alt="Figure 1.8 – The Duplicate Database dialog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.8 – The Duplicate Database dialog</p>

				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Continue</strong>.</li>
				<li>You can then <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>click on the name of the newly created database on the database management screen to access the login screen for that database.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Removing a database</h3>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>you have finished your tests, you will want to clean up the duplicated databases. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>On the database management screen, you will find the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button next to the name of the database. Clicking on it will bring up the following dialog:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B20997_01_9.0.jpg" alt="Figure 1.9 – The Delete Database dialog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.9 – The Delete Database dialog</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Fill in the form, as well as the <strong class="bold">Master Password</strong> field, which is the master password <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>of the Odoo server.</li>
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Delete</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Caution! Potential data loss!</p>
			<p class="callout">If you selected the wrong database and have no backup, there is no way to recover the lost data.</p>
			<h3>Backing up a database</h3>
			<p>To create a <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>backup, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>On the database management screen, you will find the <strong class="bold">Backup</strong> button next to the database’s name. Clicking on it will bring up the following dialog:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B20997_01_10.jpg" alt="Figure 1.10 – The Backup Database dialog"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.10 – The Backup Database dialog</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Fill in the form, as follows:<ul><li><code>zip</code> for a production database since this is the only <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>real full backup format. Only use the <code>pg_dump</code> format for a development database when you don’t care about the file store.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Backup</strong>. The backup file will be downloaded to your browser.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Restoring a database backup</h3>
			<p>If you need <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>to restore a backup, this is what you need to do:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>On the database management screen, you will find a <strong class="bold">Restore Database</strong> button at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on it will bring up the following dialog:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B20997_01_11.jpg" alt="Figure 1.11 – The Restore Database dialog"/>

The database must not exist on the server.</li><li><strong class="bold">This database might have been moved or copied</strong>: Choose <strong class="bold">This database was moved</strong> if the original database was on another server or if it has been deleted from the current server. Otherwise, choose <strong class="bold">This database is a copy</strong>, which is the safe default option.</li></ul></li>
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Continue</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It isn’t <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>possible to restore a database on top of itself. If you try to do this, you will get an error message (<strong class="bold">Database restore error: Database already exists</strong>). You need to remove the database first.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>How it works...</h2>
			<p>These features, apart from the <strong class="bold">Change master password</strong> screen, run PostgreSQL administration commands on the server and report back through the web interface.</p>
			<p>The master password <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>is a very important piece of information that only lives in the Odoo server configuration file and is never stored in the database. There used to be a default value of <code>admin</code>, but using this value is a security liability. In Odoo v9 and later, this is identified as an <em class="italic">unset</em> master password, and you are urged to change it when accessing the database administration interface. Even if it is stored in the configuration file under the <code>admin_passwd</code> entry, this is not the same as the password of the <code>admin</code> user; these are two independent passwords. The master password is set for an Odoo server process, which itself can handle multiple database instances, each of which has an independent <code>admin</code> user with their own password.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Security considerations</p>
			<p class="callout">Remember that we are considering a development environment in this chapter. The Odoo database management interface is something that needs to be secured when you are working on a production server as it gives access to a lot of sensitive information, especially if the server hosts Odoo instances for several different clients.</p>
			<p>To create a new database, Odoo uses the PostgreSQL <code>createdb</code> utility and calls the internal Odoo function to initialize the new database in the same way as when you start Odoo on an empty database.</p>
			<p>To duplicate a database, Odoo uses the <code>--template</code> option of <code>createdb</code>, passing the original database as an argument. This duplicates the structure of the template database in the new database using internal and optimized PostgreSQL routines, which is much faster than creating a backup and restoring it (especially when using the web interface, which requires you to download the backup file and upload it again).</p>
			<p>Backup and <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>restore operations use the <code>pg_dump</code> and <code>pg_restore</code> utilities, respectively. When using the <code>zip</code> format, the backup will also include a copy of the file store that contains a copy of the documents when you configure Odoo so that it doesn’t keep these in the database; this is the default option in 14.0. Unless you change it, these files reside in <code>~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore</code>.</p>
			<p>If the backup becomes too large, downloading it may fail. This will be either because the Odoo server itself is unable to handle the large file in memory or because the server is running behind a reverse proxy because there is a limit to the size of HTTP responses that were set in the proxy. Conversely, for the same reasons, you will likely experience issues with the database restore operation. When you start running into these issues, it’s time to invest in a more robust external backup solution.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>There’s more...</h2>
			<p>Experienced Odoo developers generally don’t use the database management interface and perform operations from the command line. To initialize a new database with demo data, for instance, the following single-line command can be used:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ createdb testdb &amp;&amp; odoo-bin -d testdb</pre>			<p>The bonus of using this command line is that you can request add-ons to be installed while you are using it – for instance, <code>-</code><code>i sale,purchase,stock</code>.</p>
			<p>To duplicate a database, stop the server and run the following commands:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ createdb -T dbname newdbname
$ cd ~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore # adapt if you have changed the data_dir
$ cp -r dbname newdbname
$ cd -</pre>			<p>Note that, in the <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>context of development, the file store is often omitted.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The use of <code>createdb -T</code> only works if there are no active sessions on the database, which means that you have to shut down your Odoo server before duplicating the database from the command line.</p>
			<p>To remove an instance, run the following command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ dropdb dbname
$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/dbname</pre>			<p>To create a backup (assuming that the PostgreSQL server is running locally), use the following command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ pg_dump -Fc -f dbname.dump dbname
$ tar cjf dbname.tgz dbname.dump ~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/dbname</pre>			<p>To restore the backup, run the following command:</p>
			<pre class="console">
$ tar xf dbname.tgz
$ pg_restore -C -d dbname dbname.dump</pre>			<p class="callout-heading">Caution!</p>
			<p class="callout">If your Odoo instance uses a different user to connect to the database, you need to pass <code>-U username</code> so that the correct user is the owner of the restored database.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Storing the instance configuration in a file</h1>
			<p>The <code>odoo-bin</code> script has dozens of options, and it is tedious to remember them all, as well as how <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>to remember to set them properly when starting the server. Fortunately, it is possible to store them all in a configuration file and only specify the ones you want to alter for development, for example.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>How to do it...</h2>
			<p>For this recipe, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To generate a configuration file for your Odoo instance, run the following command:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ ./odoo-bin --save --config myodoo.cfg --stop-after-init</strong></pre></li>				<li>You can add additional options, and their values will be saved in the generated file. All the unset options will be saved with their default value set. To get a list of possible options, use the following command:<pre class="source-code">
<code>--without-demo</code> will become <code>without_demo</code>. This works for most options, but there are a few exceptions, all of which are listed in the following section.</li>
				<li>Edit the <code>myodoo.cfg</code> file (use the table in the following section for some parameters you may want to change). Then, to start the server with the saved options, run the following command:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">$ ./odoo-bin -c myodoo.cfg</strong></pre></li>			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The <code>--config</code> option is commonly abbreviated as <code>-c</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>How it works...</h2>
			<p>At startup, Odoo loads its configuration in three passes. First, a set of default values for all options is initialized from the source code. After, the configuration is parsed, and then any value that’s defined in the file overrides the defaults. Finally, the command-line options are analyzed, and their values override the configuration that was obtained from the previous pass.</p>
			<p>As we mentioned earlier, the names of the configuration variables can be found by looking at the <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>names of the command-line options by removing the leading dashes and converting the middle dashes into underscores. There are a few exceptions to this, notably the following:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Table_01.jpg" alt="Table 1.1 – Difference in Odoo parameters regarding the command line and the configuration file"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 1.1 – Difference in Odoo parameters regarding the command line and the configuration file</p>
			<p>Here’s a list of options that are commonly set through the configuration file:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Table_02.jpg" alt="Table 1.2 – Odoo parameters and their usage"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 1.2 – Odoo parameters and their usage</p>
			<p>Here’s a list <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>of configuration options related to the database:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 1.3 – Odoo parameters and their usage</p>
			<p>The configuration file is parsed by Odoo using the Python <code>ConfigParser</code> module. However, the implementation in Odoo 11.0 has changed, and it is no longer possible to use variable interpolation. So, if you are used to defining values for variables from the values of other variables using the <code>%(section.variable)s</code> notation, you will need to change <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>your habits and revert to explicit values.</p>
			<p>Some options are not used in config files, but they are widely used during development:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Activating Odoo developer tools</h1>
			<p>When using Odoo <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>as a developer, you need to know how to activate <strong class="bold">developer mode</strong> in the <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>web interface so that you can access the technical settings menu and developer information. Enabling debug mode will expose several advanced configuration options and fields. These options and fields are hidden in Odoo for better usability because they are not used daily.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>How to do it...</h2>
			<p>To activate developer mode in the web interface, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Connect to your instance and authenticate as <code>admin</code>.</li>
				<li>Go to the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>Scroll to the bottom and locate the <strong class="bold">Developer </strong><strong class="bold">Tools</strong> section:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B20997_01_12.jpg" alt="Figure 1.12 – Links to activate different developer modes"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.12 – Links to activate different developer modes</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Click    <strong class="bold">Activate the </strong><strong class="bold">developer mode</strong>.</li>
				<li>Wait <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>for the UI to reload.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Alternative way</p>
			<p class="callout">It is also possible to activate developer mode by editing the URL. Before the <code>#</code> sign, insert <code>?debug=1</code>. For example, if your current URL is <code>http://localhost:8069/web#menu_id=102&amp;action=94</code> and you want to enable developer mode, then you need to change that URL to <code>http://localhost:8069/web?debug=1#menu_id=102&amp;action=94</code>. Furthermore, if you want to use debug mode with assets, then change the URL to <code>http://localhost:8069/web?debug=assets#menu_id=102&amp;action=94</code>.</p>
			<p>To exit developer mode, you can perform any one of the following operations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit the URL and write <code>?debug=0</code> in the query string</li>
				<li>Use <strong class="bold">Deactivate the developer mode</strong> from the same place in the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu</li>
				<li>Click on the bug icon in the top menu and click on the <strong class="bold">Leave Developer </strong><strong class="bold">Tools</strong> option</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lots of developers are using browser extensions to toggle debug mode. By doing this, you can toggle debug mode quickly without accessing the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu. These extensions <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>are available for Firefox and Chrome. The following screenshot shows one such plugin you can use and find in the Chrome store:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B20997_01_13.jpg" alt="Figure 1.13 – Browser extension for debug mode"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.13 – Browser extension for debug mode</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The behavior of the debug mode has changed since Odoo v13. Since v13, the status of debug mode is stored in the session, implying that even if you have removed <code>?debug</code> from the URL, debug mode will still be active.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>How it works...</h2>
			<p>In developer mode, two things happen:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You get tooltips when hovering over a field in a form view or over a column in a list view. These provide technical information about the field (internal name, type, and so on).</li>
				<li>A drop-down menu with a bug icon is displayed next to the user’s menu in the top-right corner, giving you access to technical information about the model being displayed, the various related view definitions, the workflow, custom filter management, and so on.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is a variant of developer mode called <strong class="bold">Developer mode (with assets)</strong>. This mode behaves like the normal developer mode, but the JavaScript and CSS code that’s sent to the <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>browser is not minified, which means that the web development tools of your browser can easily be used to debug the JavaScript code (more on this in <a href="B20997_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor861"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Web </em><em class="italic">Client Development</em>).</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Caution!</p>
			<p class="callout">Test your add-ons both with and without developer mode since the unminified versions of the JavaScript libraries can hide bugs that only bite you in the minified version.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>How it works…</h2>
			<p>When the <code>__manifest__.py</code> that’s stored in the add-on module directory. Odoo reads the manifest, expecting to find a Python dictionary. Unless the manifest contains a key <code>installable</code> instance set to <code>False</code>, the add-on <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>module metadata is recorded in the database. If the module is already present, the information is updated. If not, a new record is created. If a previously available add-on module is not found, the record is not deleted from the list.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">An updated apps list is only required if you add the new add-on path after initializing the database. If you add the new add-on path to the configuration file before initializing the database, then there will be no need to update the module list manually.</p>
			<p>To summarize what we have learned so far, after installing, you can start the Odoo server by using the following command line (if you are using a virtual environment, then you need to activate it first):</p>
			<pre class="console">
python3 odoo-bin -d odoo-test -i base --addons-path=addons --db-filter=odoo-test</pre>			<p>Once you’ve run the module, you can access Odoo from http://localhost:8069.</p>
			<p>You can also use a configuration file to run Odoo, as follows:</p>
			<pre class="console">
./odoo-bin -c myodoo.cfg</pre>			<p>Once you start the Odoo server, you can install/update modules from the <strong class="bold">App</strong> menu.</p>

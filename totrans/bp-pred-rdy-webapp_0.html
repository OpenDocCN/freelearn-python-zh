<div><div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>The aim of this book is to show you how to develop a web application using industry best practices and place it in a running production environment. We’ll do this by creating a working to-do app. This app is live at <code>tozo.dev</code>, and all the code for it is available under the MIT license at <a href="http://github.com/pgjones/tozo">github.com/pgjones/tozo</a>.</p>
<p>The development blueprint presented in this book is based on one I’ve used to successfully build apps before, including for my own start-up a few years ago. The technology used here has been chosen because of its popularity in the industry, with Python, NodeJS, and Terraform being popular tools for full-stack development, and AWS being a popular cloud infrastructure provider.</p>
<p>I started writing this book as the guide I wish I’d had when I started my full-stack engineering career. I’ve tried to answer as many of the questions that I had when I started and introduce much of the vocabulary I was missing. Over the past year, I’ve been refining and using this blueprint to help guide and develop junior engineers in their first industrial jobs. I hope it helps you to build great apps too!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for software engineers who already know how to program (such as recent computer science or bootcamp graduates) and want to learn how to build an app following industry processes (for example, using continuous integration and deployment).</p>
<p>You will need a working knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. Apart from that, you are expected to be new to Quart, React, AWS, and all other specific technologies and processes introduced in the book.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p>In <a href="B18727_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Setting Up Our System for Development</em>, we’ll set up everything needed to develop the app. This includes installing Python, Node.js, Terraform, and Git, along with the associated tooling for each. </p>
<p>In <a href="B18727_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating a Reusable Backend with Quart</em>, we’ll build a backend that can be used for any app, introducing elements such as authentication, protection, database connections, and email.</p>
<p>In <a href="B18727_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor076"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building the API</em>, we’ll build a to-do tracking RESTful CRUD API that includes member and session management.</p>
<p>In <a href="B18727_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor111"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating a Reusable Frontend with React</em>, we’ll build a frontend that can be used for any app, while discussing routing, styled data entry (forms), state management, and toast feedback.</p>
<p>In <a href="B18727_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor138"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Building the Single-Page App</em>, we’ll build a to-do tracking user interface by creating pages that allow users to register and log in to our app, as well as to change and manage their passwords.</p>
<p>In <a href="B18727_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying and Monitoring Your Application</em>, we’ll deploy the app to AWS running in Docker. Here, we will discuss how to set up a domain name, employ HTTPS, and monitor the app for errors.</p>
<p>In <a href="B18727_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor180"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing and Packaging the App</em>, we’ll adopt industry best practices to secure the app and package it for the app stores, which includes adding multi-factor authentication and meeting the requirements to be a progressive web app.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>You will need to be able to read and understand basic Python, TypeScript, HTML, and SQL. Everything else will be introduced in the book.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Conventions used</h1>
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “The <code>reminderName</code> string is a string that uniquely identifies the reminder within the scope of the contextual grain.”</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
class APIError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, status_code: int, code: str) -&gt; None:
        self.status_code = status_code
        self.code = code</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
public interface IHotelGrain : IGrainWithStringKey
    {
        &lt;&lt;Code removed for brevity&gt;&gt;
        <strong class="bold">public Task Subscribe(IObserver observer);</strong>
        <strong class="bold">public Task UnSubscribe(IObserver observer);</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>az monitor app-insights component create --app ai-distel-prod --location westus  --resource-group rg-distel-prod</pre>
<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “The <strong class="bold">Client System</strong> sends the batches of messages to the <strong class="bold">Dispatcher Grain</strong>, which enumerates through the batch of messages to dispatch the messages to each target grain.”</p>

<p>Before we can build our app, we need a system that is set up for fast development. This means we’ll need to install tooling to autoformat, lint, and test our code, alongside using Git for version control and Terraform to manage the infrastructure. </p>
<p>This part consists of the following chapter:</p>

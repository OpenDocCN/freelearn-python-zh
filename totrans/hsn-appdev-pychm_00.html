<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is designed for a diverse audience of individuals who are interested in Python programming and wish to leverage the PyCharm integrated development environment (IDE) to enhance their coding experience. Here are the primary groups of people for whom this book is tailored:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Beginner Programmers</strong>: If you are new to programming or have limited coding experience, this book provides a gentle introduction to Python and PyCharm. By its very nature, PyCharm makes Python easier to learn by providing a great deal of help in setting up project templates, providing auto-completion, and automatic PEP-8 formatting for your code.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Intermediate Python Developers</strong>: If you already have some experience with Python but want to deepen your knowledge and proficiency, this book along with PyCharm can help. PyCharm’s configurable linter and code analysis technology will hold your work to the highest standards.  Refactoring, a practice that is too often neglected, becomes trivial owing to PyCharm’s indexing and refactoring tools. You’ll learn to use integrated testing, coverage, and profiling tools to ensure your code runs swiftly and reliably.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Experienced Developers from Other Languages</strong>: If you are an experienced programmer in another language and want to transition to Python or incorporate Python into your skillset, this book will help you bridge the gap and master Python programming using PyCharm. This is especially true if you’ve used other PyCharm IDEs. If you normally use IntelliJ Idea, WebStorm, Rider, or PHP Storm, you’ll be right at home since you’ll be using the same keyboard shortcuts.  If you use Visual Studio, you can easily configure PyCharm to use the keyboard shortcuts you are used to, and we think you’ll find common workflows, like working with Git, to be superior and more intuitive in PyCharm.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Students and Educators</strong>: Python is a popular language for teaching and learning programming. This book can serve as a valuable resource for students studying Python as part of their coursework and educators looking for a comprehensive guide to teaching Python with PyCharm effectively.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data Scientists and Analysts</strong>: Python is widely used in the field of data analysis and machine learning. This book covers advanced libraries and tools for data exploration, manipulation, cleansing, and analysis, making it valuable for data professionals seeking to improve their Python skills within the context of PyCharm. PyCharm contains a powerful set of tools for working with relational and non-relational databases which are fully covered.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Web Developers</strong>: If you are interested in web development using Python, this book covers web frameworks and tools, enabling you to create dynamic web applications with PyCharm as your development tool. You’ll learn to create projects in popular web development frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, and Django. Most people don’t realize it, by PyCharm professional contains a full IDE geared towards JavaScript and HTML development. This book covers this in great detail.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Anyone Interested in Python and PyCharm:</strong> If you have a general interest in programming, technology, or Python in particular, this book offers an engaging exploration of Python’s capabilities and PyCharm’s features, making it accessible and informative for a wide range of readers.</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter your background or level of expertise, this book is intended to be a valuable resource for anyone eager to learn Python programming and harness the power of PyCharm to write efficient, readable, and maintainable code.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>I assume you understand basic Python programming along with basic command line skills for your favorite operating system. One thing to remember throughout is that we are covering PyCharm rather than deep development tutorials of frameworks mentioned in various chapters. For example, <a href="B19644_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a> covers the PyCharm features designed for Flask development. It isn’t meant to be a full tutorial on Flask.</p>

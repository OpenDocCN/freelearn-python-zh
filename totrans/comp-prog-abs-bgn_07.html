		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Chapter 5:</em> Sequence – The Basic Building Block of a Computer Program</h1>
			<p>When it comes to programming, the most fundamental concept is the sequence. It indicates what we do and when we do it, one after another. However, when we take a closer look, we find that there is more to this, and, in this chapter, we will learn what it is.</p>
			<p>We will also use the concept of a sequence to decide what steps a program will need to perform to accomplish its overall task. Since it can be tough to have both an overview of everything that needs to be done and, at the same time, look at all the details, we will require a concept that can assist us. Thinking of the sequence in which the program needs to do things in, for instance, could be such a tool.</p>
			<p>When learning how to program, one problem many people face is how to transform an idea to go. Where should you start? In this chapter, we will learn that we can use the concept of sequential thinking to break down an idea into smaller tasks that we then can deal with. We will also see that we can apply the same concept to the code that we write to ensure that we do things in the right order.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will look at the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding the importance of sequences</li>
				<li>What a statement is and how it is defined</li>
				<li>How different statements are separated</li>
				<li>How to format the code to make it more readable</li>
				<li>Different kinds of comments and ways to document our code</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>The importance of sequences</h1>
			<p>One day, when<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> you come home, you start craving a pie, so you decide to make one. The reason you will bake a pie is not that you wish to cook, but to satisfy your desire for pie. However, to be able to get the pie, you need to perform several steps. First, you need a recipe, and then you need to get all of the ingredients. When you acquire them, you will follow each step in the recipe. Then, finally, after the pie has been in the oven and cooled down a bit, you can enjoy your well-deserved treat. </p>
			<p>You just performed a few <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>tasks in sequence. Some of them need to be completed in the right order, while others can be done in any order (or, at least, in a more relaxed order). You must turn on the oven before you can bake the pie, but it is not essential that you bring out the flour before the butter. </p>
			<p>Programming is like baking a pie. We will have goals, such as we want pie, and to be able to achieve that goal, we will need to do several things: in some instances, the order is essential, while others are less dependent on the order. </p>
			<p>Programming is all about problem-solving and the art of breaking things down into smaller steps. This will be done in iterations where you first have an overall solution and then break this solution down into smaller and smaller steps until you are on a level where you understand each step that needs to be taken. </p>
			<p>This is one of the more difficult skills to master when you begin to learn programming. As with all new skills, it takes lots of practice before you will feel comfortable doing this. Some tricks can make it easier for you to acquire this skill. The essential ability you require is an overview of the full problem that you are trying to solve and, at the same time, a focus on details of one or more subproblems that need to be resolved. This means that you will need to zoom in and out on the details while keeping an overall view of the whole problem. You can practice this without doing any programming. Playing logical puzzle games such as Sudoku will train your brain to keep an eye on the overall game and, at the same time, focus on individual parts of the game such as what numbers can go into a certain cell.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at how we can go from a problem to a solution on a sequential level. First, we need to define the problem.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Defining the problem</h2>
			<p>You often arrive <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>home after dark, and you always forget to turn on the outdoor lighting before you leave home. It is so dark that you are afraid of stumbling on your way to the door, and finding the keyhole is always a gamble. </p>
			<p>On the other hand, you don't want the light to be on all day. You don't like the idea of those automatic lights that react to motion either, as it will be activated when the neighbor's cat passes by. There must be a better solution.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>The solution to the problem</h2>
			<p>One solution would<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> be if you could use your smartphone's GPS. If you had a program running on it that continually monitors your position, then when you come into a given radius from your home, it could somehow activate the lights. You soon realize that your solution will need to be a two-part application. One part runs on your phone, and the other part runs on a computer in your home. The program running on a computer in your house would get a signal from your mobile app that you now are close to home. It could then check with an online service to see what time the sun sets at your home's location during this time of year. If it is past sunset, the program can activate the lights.</p>
			<p>What we have done so far is to start to define a solution. Now we must break down this solution further.</p>
			<h3>Solution breakdown</h3>
			<p>We now have an overview of <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>what we want, and, at the same time, we have zoomed in on a couple of details. We have decided that we would like to use the phone's GPS. We don't know how this can be done yet, but that is not important at this stage. We know that other applications can use GPS. This means that we know it is possible to do it and even if we, at the moment, have no idea how this is done, we can learn it later on in the process. We have also decided that this will be a two-part application. The part on the phone will, aside from monitoring the GPS, also need a way to contact the other part of our solution, which is the application running on a computer in your home. Again, we don't know how this will be done, but we know it can be done, and that is good enough for now. We also understand that we need a way to detect that we are coming from outside the defined range and then entering it. It is only then that the lights should be turned on. If we don't do this, the lights would always be on when the phone is within a stipulated range and we don't want that.</p>
			<p>The home application will need to wait for a signal from the mobile app and then contact a service that can tell us about the time the sun will set. On our to-do list, we add that we need to find such a service. Again, we don't need to bother about how this can be done. We will also find a way for our home application to control the lights. We will most likely require some hardware for this step, but that will be a problem that we can deal with later.</p>
			<p>What we now have is a sequential list of steps that we need to take. That list looks something like this.</p>
			<p>Here is a list of steps for the <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>mobile application:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is the phone within the predefined range?</li>
				<li>If yes, was it previously outside the range, that is, have we just entered this range? Let us check:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_01.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1: The phone enters the predefined region"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1: The phone enters the predefined region</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If yes, send a signal to the home application:</li>
			</ul>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2: The phone application contacts the application running on the home computer</p>
			<p>Here is a list of steps for the <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>home application:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Wait for a signal from the mobile app.</li>
				<li>When a signal is received, check the current time:<div><img src="img/B15554_05_03.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3: The application that is running on the home computer checks the local time"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3: The application that is running on the home computer checks the local time</p></li>
				<li>Check the online service for the local sunset time:<div><img src="img/B15554_05_04.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4: The application that is running on the home computer contacts &#13;&#10;an online service to get the local sunset time"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4: The application that is running on the home computer contacts an online service to get the local sunset time</p></li>
				<li>If the time is after<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> sunset, turn on lights:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_05.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5: If the time is after sunset, the home application turns on the light"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5: If the time is after sunset, the home application turns on the light</p>
			<p>This is still a slightly rough<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> breakdown of the sequential steps that we need to take. But now that we have them, we can zoom in on each of them and think about the things we need to do for each of the preceding steps.</p>
			<h3>A detailed breakdown for the phone application</h3>
			<p>Let's take each of the steps, one by one, and closely examine what we need to do for each of them.</p>
			<p>So, how can we know whether <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>the phone is within the predefined range? To understand this, we must first do some research. The first thing we need to understand is how the phone GPS knows where it is. Searching online will soon reveal that a GPS works with two coordinates: longitude and latitude. These two coordinates will pinpoint any location on the earth. This means that when we request the current location from the GPS, we will be given these coordinates.</p>
			<p>When we have these coordinates, we need to check how far away we are from home. To do this, we will need to know where home is, so the application on the phone needs to store this location somehow, and it will also be in the form of a longitude and a latitude.</p>
			<p>Calculating the distance between two geocoordinates is not a trivial task, but we don't need to worry as this is something that has been done many times before. In addition to this, no matter what language we are using, a simple Google search will give us many solutions for how this can be done. We might even be able to use the language package manager (refer to the <em class="italic">Package managers</em> section in <a href="B15554_04_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Software Projects and How We Organize Our Code</em>, to learn what a packet manager is and how it works) to find a package that can do this calculation.</p>
			<p>No matter what solution we use, we can assume that we will use the two coordinate pairs that we have, the phone's location, and our home location, and what we get back is a distance between them. We also need to decide how close to home we need to be for the lights to activate. This can be any distance. </p>
			<p>Next, we have to check <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>whether we have come from outside the predefined range. We need a way to tell whether we have entered the predefined range or whether we already were within the range. We could do this by keeping track of what the distance to home was before we check the current position. If we were outside the range and are now inside it, then we know that we are close enough to home to send the signal to turn on the lights.</p>
			<p>So, now we need to send a signal to the home application. When we have entered the range, we need a way for the phone application to contact the home computer. This can be done in several ways, and there is no need for us to decide what technique to use at this point.</p>
			<p>We can now summarize the sequence for the phone application.</p>
			<h3>Phone application sequence</h3>
			<p>Now we have the logic for the<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> phone application in place. We also know what the sequence will need to look like. It will look something like this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Get the current position.</li>
				<li>Calculate the distance from home.</li>
				<li>Is the distance within the range that defines when we are close enough to turn on the lights?</li>
				<li>Was our previous distance, that is, the distance of the last time we checked our position, outside the given range?</li>
				<li>If the answer to the questions in <em class="italic">step 3</em> and <em class="italic">step 4</em> are both yes, tell the home computer to turn on the light. If it is no, we can go back to <em class="italic">step 1</em>.</li>
				<li>Store the distance <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>from home as our old distance.</li>
				<li>Start over from <em class="italic">step 1</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>These steps are illustrated here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_06.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6: Sequence for the phone application"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6: Sequence for the phone application</p>
			<p>These seven steps will be repeated over and over. We will need to consider what will happen when we perform the first iteration as we will not have a value for the old distance. We can give this an initial default value that is well outside the range, for example, a negative number.</p>
			<p>We now have a well-defined sequence of steps, and we have not written a line of code yet. This is good because it will help us when we start to write the code as we can zoom in and focus on each of these steps without losing track of the overview. </p>
			<p>We can now turn our attention to the home application.</p>
			<h3>A detailed breakdown of the home application</h3>
			<p>At first, the home application will have absolutely nothing to do as it will just sit and wait for a signal from the phone app. However, when it gets that signal, it will wake up and start to do its work. </p>
			<p>When the home application gets<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> the message from the phone, the first thing it needs to do is one of two things. Either it can check the local time, or it can contact the sunset service to get the current sunset time. The order of these two operations is not essential as we need both, so we can compare them.</p>
			<p>When we have the local time and the sunset time, we need to compare them to see whether it is after dark. If it is, all the conditions for turning on the light are met, and we get a signal that the phone is within range and that it is dark outside.</p>
			<p>Now we need to turn on the outside light. We still need to figure out how this can be done. One way to do this is to use LED lamps that can be controlled wirelessly. These can often be interacted with from an application such as the one we are about to create. We should do some research before buying the lights since we need to select a brand that can be controlled by our application. </p>
			<h3>Home application sequence</h3>
			<p>The sequence for the home application<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> is as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Wait for a signal from the phone app.</li>
				<li>When the signal is received, get the local time.</li>
				<li>Contact the sunset service to get the local sunset time.</li>
				<li>Compare the current time with the sunset time. </li>
				<li>If it is after sunset, turn on the light.</li>
				<li>Go back to step 1.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Step 2 and step 3 can be performed in any order. If the current time is before the sunset time, the application will skip turning on the light and go back to step 1. The sequence is depicted here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_07.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7: Sequence for the home application"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7: Sequence for the home application</p>
			<p>We now have an excellent<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> starting point regarding how to build this application. Even if several things are still unclear to us, such as how the phone application shall contact the home application, what service the home application will use to check the sunset time and how it will get in touch with it, and how the home application will turn on the light, the sequence that the different things must be performed in, is now clear to us.</p>
			<p>At this point, we have a good idea of what our application needs to do, but we still have a number of things we need to do. First of all, we need to learn the necessary things to create this application. How can we get the position from the phone GPS? When learning things like this, it is usually a good idea to create a <em class="italic">toy project</em> where you can just try to get the coordinates and print them to the screen. When you have figured that out, you can then take this solution into your real project. Doing it in a separate project is smart because you can focus on learning one particular thing at a time. Another example is that we need to implement a way to calculate the distance between two geocoordinates. Apply the same principle of doing it in a separate application when testing different solutions. When you get a result, you should find an online service that does this calculation so that you can verify your results. In programming, you never stop learning new things and technologies. There are always things you have never done before. But don't let that stop you. </p>
			<p>This is one aspect of sequencing in a computer program. Another point is what happens on a smaller level. In the code that we write, every step we perform needs to be broken down into something known as a <em class="italic">statement</em>, and those statements will be performed in sequence.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Understanding statements</h2>
			<p>In many programming languages, the<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/> sequence of code that we write is made up of what are called statements. A statement expresses some action to be carried out and is made up of several internal components. These are called expressions.</p>
			<h3>Expressions</h3>
			<p>Statements are made up of expressions, and expressions<a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> are made up of even smaller parts. Let's refer to an example:</p>
			<pre>5 + 4</pre>
			<p>This is an expression made up of three parts. Here, we are operating using the addition operator, <code>+</code>. On both sides of the operator, we have the operands in the form of two constant values, <code>5</code> and <code>4</code>. </p>
			<p>A statement can be made up of more than one expression. Take a look at the following code:</p>
			<pre>result = 5 + 4</pre>
			<p>Here, we have the same expression as we had earlier, <code>5 + 4</code>, but now with a new expression to the left:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_08.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8: A statement with two expressions, one addition and one assignment"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8: A statement with two expressions, one addition and one assignment</p>
			<p>Again, we have two operands, the result of the addition, <code>9</code>, to the right, and to the left, we have something called a <em class="italic">variable</em>, named <code>result</code>. A variable is a way for us to store data in memory using a name we define:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_10.jpg" alt="Figure 5.9: When the result of the addition is calculated the assignment expression can be performed"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9: When the result of the addition is calculated the assignment expression can be performed</p>
			<p>We will talk more about variables in <a href="B15554_06_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor091"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Data – Variables</em>. We also introduced a second operator, <code>=</code>. This operator is called the assignment operator. It takes what is on the right and stores it in what is on the left:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_11.jpg" alt="Figure 5.10: The variable called result can be visualized as a box; &#13;&#10;the assignment stores a value in that box"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10: The variable called result can be visualized as a box; the assignment stores a value in that box</p>
			<p>To be able to complete this statement, the expressions<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> must be dealt with in the correct order. This is called the order of operations.</p>
			<h3>Order of operations</h3>
			<p>To store the result of the <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>addition in the variable called <code>result</code>, we must first perform the expression to the right; that is the addition, as follows:</p>
			<pre>result = 5 + 4
           9</pre>
			<p>When the expression to the right is completed, we can imagine that our statement will look like this:</p>
			<pre>result = 9</pre>
			<p>Now, this final expression can be executed. The value of <code>9</code> is assigned (it is stored) in the <code>result</code> variable.</p>
			<p>A statement can be made up of more expressions. Consider the following:</p>
			<pre>result = 5 + 4 * 2</pre>
			<p>The first thing we must understand here is the order of operations, that is, in which order the addition and the multiplication is performed. If we do the addition first, we will do <code>5</code> <code>+</code> <code>4</code>, which is 9, and then 9 times <code>2</code>, which is 18. </p>
			<p>If we instead do the multiplication first, we would get <code>4</code> times <code>2</code>, which is 8, and then <code>5 +</code> 8, which is 13. So, the order is important. Every programming language has a well-defined order of operations, which is in what different order the operations must be performed. </p>
			<p>In this example, the order will be the<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> same as in mathematics; multiplication will be performed before addition:</p>
			<pre>result = 5 + 4 * 2
               8
result = 5 + 8
           13
result = 13</pre>
			<p>If we want to override the built-in order of operations, we can use parentheses like this:</p>
			<pre>result = (5 + 4) * 2</pre>
			<p>Now the addition is performed first because it is within parentheses, so the variable result will now store the value of 18 (9 times 2).</p>
			<p>Some statements are made up of more than one single line. These are often called compound statements. Let's explore what those are next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Compound statements</h2>
			<p>A compound statement<a id="_idIndexMarker198"/> is a statement that spans several lines. These compound statements are made up of one or more <em class="italic">normal</em> one-line statements. They can also consist of other compound statements, as we will learn later on. For example, in our application that turns on the light, we have some conditions that must be met before we do something. One condition is that we only turn on the light if the current time is after sunset. The logic can be visualized in a flowchart:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_12.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11. Flowchart for the home application"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11. Flowchart for the home application</p>
			<p>As you can see, the part where<a id="_idIndexMarker199"/> we turn on the light is only executed if it is after sunset. So, for that statement to be performed, we have a condition that must be met. That condition is a statement, but that statement includes the statement that turns on the light.</p>
			<p>In code, it can look something like this:</p>
			<pre>wait_for_phone_signal()
current_time = get_current_time()
sunset_time = get_sunset_time()
if current_time &gt; sunset_time then
    turn_on_light()
end_if</pre>
			<p>The first line of the preceding code contains one single statement. It is a function call. We will discuss functions in more detail in <a href="B15554_08_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor116"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding Functions</em>. We can see that it is a function because it ends with parentheses. For now, we can regard these parentheses as an indication that something is a function. Calling a function means that, somewhere, there are several lines of code that have been given a name. Calling the function means that we will jump to that location and execute those lines. In this example, the content of the function is not visible. This function will halt the program until a signal comes in from the phone.</p>
			<p>The statement on the second <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>line is made up of one operation, with one operator and two operands. We recognize the equals sign as the assignment operator. That means that whatever is to the right will be assigned (remember that we can see an assignment because the thing to the right will be stored in the item to the left) to what's on the left-hand side. To the left, we have a variable that can contain a value. It has the name <code>current_time</code>. What we have to the right is another function call. This function will grab the current time and return it. When this statement has been executed, the present time will be stored in the <code>current_time</code> variable.</p>
			<p>Line 3 is like line 2. This statement is also made up of one operator and two operands. The operand on the right is again a function call. This is the function that will contact the sunset service online and return the sunset time for our location. To the left, we have a <code>sunset_time</code> variable and we assign the time we get back from the function to this variable. When this statement has been executed, we have the sunset time stored in the <code>sunset_time</code> variable.</p>
			<p>Line 4 starts with an <code>if</code>. This is a special kind of statement, spanning over several lines. This one covers lines 4 to 6. It contains another statement, the one on line 5. Line 4 is a condition. It checks whether the value in the <code>current_time</code> variable is greater than the value in the <code>sunset_time</code> variable. This can either be true or false. If it is greater, that is, the statement is true, then the code inside this compound statement is executed. If it is false, the value in <code>current_time</code> is not greater than the value in <code>sunset_time</code>; the code inside the statement will not be executed. In this case, the end of the compound statement is the last line: <code>end_if</code>. It indicates that everything between the line starting with <code>if</code> and the <code>end_if</code> line is a part of that statement. It should be noted that there is a flaw in the logic as this condition will not work if the current time is after midnight, but let's ignore that for now.</p>
			<p>The statement on line 5 that turns on the light is yet again a call to a function. Also, note that this line starts with some spaces. This is called an indentation and is something we will discuss in more detail later in this chapter.</p>
			<p>We now know that statements <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>are made up of expressions or other statements. To be able to figure out where a statement ends and another begins, a language will define how they are separated. How this is done will be a part of the language syntax. Let's explore how we can do that next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Separating statements</h2>
			<p>A programming<a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> language will separate statements by defining where a statement ends. If the language can figure out where one statement ends, it also knows that what comes after it must be the beginning of another statement.</p>
			<p>Languages have different ways to define this. If we compare how different languages terminate statements, we will see that we have three main ways for it to be done. Many languages will terminate a statement by inserting a new line. This means that, in general, every line is a single statement if it is not a compound statement, as it will need to be handled uniquely.</p>
			<p>Another popular way to terminate statements is by using a semicolon, <code>;</code>. For languages that use this technique, we can have several statements on a single line. The language knows that a statement ends as soon as it sees a semicolon.</p>
			<p>A third variant is to use a period, <code>.</code>, instead of a semicolon. Apart from that, it works the same way as when a semicolon is used so that we can have more than one statement on a single line.</p>
			<p>A few languages will use other techniques, such as using a colon instead of a semicolon.</p>
			<p>Some languages that terminate statements with a new line include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>BASIC</li>
				<li>Fortran</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Ruby</li>
				<li>Visual Basic</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some languages that end statements with a semicolon include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Go (even if the compiler automatically inserts them)</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>Kotlin</li>
				<li>Pascal</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>Rust</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some languages that use other <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>symbols to terminate statements include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ABAP (period)</li>
				<li>COBOL (whitespace, such as a space, tab, or newline; sometimes, a period)</li>
				<li>Erlang (period, comma, and semicolon)</li>
				<li>Lua (whitespace such as a space, tab, or newline)</li>
				<li>Prolog (comma, semicolon, and period)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For compound statements, we will need a way to define where they begin and where they end. As a compound statement is made up of one or more statements, many languages will use another method to terminate them.</p>
			<p>Here, we will find three main techniques that languages use. One is to use curly brackets, <code>{}</code>, to indicate where a compound statement begins and ends. Everything that is placed between the brackets is considered to be part of the compound statement.</p>
			<p>In such a language, the compound <code>if</code> statement that we saw in the preceding code should look like this:</p>
			<pre>if current_time &gt; sunset_time {
    turn_on_light()
}</pre>
			<p>As you can see, there is an open bracket at the end of the first line and a closing bracket on the last line.</p>
			<p>Examples of languages that use this technique include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Go</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Another way to do this is to use<a id="_idIndexMarker204"/> end statements. Different languages will have slight variations on this.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples.</p>
			<p>In the Ada programming language, an <code>if</code> statement looks like this:</p>
			<pre>if current_time &gt; sunset_time then
    turn_on_light();
end if</pre>
			<p>The same statement in Modula-2 is just slightly different:</p>
			<pre>IF current_time &gt; sunset_time THEN
    turn_on_light();
END;</pre>
			<p>Ruby has another variant that is along the same lines:</p>
			<pre>if current_time &gt; sunset_time 
    turn_on_light()
end </pre>
			<p>The last variant is the language that will use indentation to accomplish the same thing. Remember that indentation is when we use a space to push in the code. </p>
			<p>If you look at all of the preceding examples, the line containing <code>turn_on_light</code> is always indented. In those languages, it is only because it makes the code easier to read for us as humans. However, some languages will use this to define where a compound statement begins and ends.</p>
			<p>One such language is Python. The <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>code example for Python should look something like this:</p>
			<pre>if current_time &gt; sunset_time: 
    turn_on_light()</pre>
			<p>Here, everything that is indented is part of the compound statement. To indicate that something that comes afterward is not part of the statement, it would be written on the same level as the <code>if</code> statement, like so:</p>
			<pre>if current_time &gt; sunset_time: 
    turn_on_light()
result = 4 + 5</pre>
			<p>Here, the last line is not part of the compound statement as it is written without any indentation.</p>
			<p>As mentioned, an indentation can be used to make the code easier to read, while some languages will use it for compound statement termination. Let's go on to discuss why the readability of code is important and how we can use indentation and blank lines to improve it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Making the code readable by indenting and using empty lines</h2>
			<p>Ever since we moved <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>away from machine code, the motivation has been that we want code that is easier to read and write for humans. We shall keep this in mind when we are writing code, as code does not just consist of instructions to the computer, but also something that needs to be maintained by either us or others. </p>
			<p>As we have learned, one tool that we can use to make the intentions of the code clearer to whoever reads it is indentation.</p>
			<h3>The indentation technique</h3>
			<p>Indentation is a technique that we use<a id="_idIndexMarker207"/> to show that certain code lines belong together in a block. This is typically done for compound statements. Since a compound statement can be constructed of other statements or other compound statements, indentation becomes essential to be able to see what code block a statement belongs to:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_13.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12: Indented code will be a visual aid that indicates how compound statements are constructed"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12: Indented code will be a visual aid that indicates how compound statements are constructed</p>
			<p>Even if the lines in the preceding diagram are just lines, we could make out the individual components they represent. If we color them, as in <em class="italic">figure 5.13</em>, we can see that this page is made up of four statements. The first line is a single statement, but then we have the green lines: these are compound statements, starting at line 2. Again, the purple lines are compound statements and, in the end, we have a single line that makes up a one-line statement.</p>
			<p>The dashed lines represent compound statements and are made up of single-line statements and a compound statement, as indicated by the indentation. It is the same thing with the dotted lines:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_14.jpg" alt="Figure 5.13: The dashed lines are a compound statement containing another compound statement; the same is true for the dotted lines"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.13: The dashed lines are a compound statement containing another compound statement; the same is true for the dotted lines</p>
			<p>As you can see, the indentation will<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> carry lots of information to the reader if we know how to interpret it. It is, therefore, crucial that we are careful to get the indentation right when writing our code. In most languages, this information is only interesting to human readers. The compiler or interpreter will ignore the indentation. But some languages, such as Python, use indentation as their tool to define compound statements, making the indentation mandatory and a part of the language's syntax.</p>
			<p>Commonly, the text editor that a programmer uses to write the code will help with code indentation, either by automatically indenting code within a compound statement or by providing built-in commands that, when executed, will adequately format the code. </p>
			<p>There is another formatting trick that we can use to make our code more readable to humans. One such trick is the use of blank lines.</p>
			<h3>Blank lines</h3>
			<p>Blank lines<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> separate the paragraphs in this book. The reason is apparent. Without them, the text would be hard to read. These empty lines are not inserted at random. The text within a paragraph is logically connected. We can indicate that the text changes focus by creating a new paragraph, which is by inserting a blank line in the text.</p>
			<p>The same thing applies to code. Blank lines are inserted for human readers. It is used to show the intent the programmer has. If three statements are somehow connected logically, we can indicate this by adding a blank line after the last statement.</p>
			<p>The following is some Python code. It is not important to know what this code does, but look at the use of indentation and blank lines:</p>
			<pre>for n in range(1000,3001):
    str_num = str(n)
    split_str = list(str_num)
    all_even = True
    for x in split_str:
        if int(x) % 2 != 0:
            all_even = False
    if all_even:
        print(n, ",", end = "")</pre>
			<p>Here, we can see that all the code is within one single compound statement as all lines, except the first, are indented. Further down, we can see other compound statements. Every time the indentation level increases, a new compound statement begins, and when it decreases, one ends. </p>
			<p>There are also some blank lines. This indicates that there is a logical connection between the lines preceding the empty line. </p>
			<p>Let's take a look at lines 2 and 3 and how they are connected. In line 2, we are preparing some data so that it will be in the right form for what we want to do on line 3. Here, we can see the importance of the sequence. Line 3 will require a number in a particular format. So, line 2 prepares the number so that it can be used on line 3. </p>
			<p>When these two lines are completed, the program changes its focus slightly. Even if we don't understand anything about what the code does, the information carried by the indentation and the blank lines will give us clues that will make it easier to read the code.</p>
			<p>Blanks lines are also <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>something that compilers and interpreters will ignore, so they are there for us humans. Just as it is vital to use paragraphs in a line of text correctly, we must use blank lines in a way that makes sense and assist the reader of our code.</p>
			<p>There is another tool that we also can use to make things easier to understand for a human reading our code, and that is comments.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Making the code understandable using comments</h2>
			<p>Indentation and blank<a id="_idIndexMarker211"/> lines are not always enough to make the intent of the code clear. In such cases, we can use comments. A comment is a line of normal text, inserted in the code, which is only for humans. We use them to explain lines of code that are not obviously understood at first glance. </p>
			<p>As the compiler or interpreter ignores comments, we need a way to indicate that something is a comment. We have two variants of comments; one that runs to the end of the line, called a <em class="italic">line comment</em>, and one that spans multiple lines, often referred to as a <em class="italic">block comment</em>. Let's understand each in turn, in the following sections.</p>
			<h3>Line comments</h3>
			<p>A line comment<a id="_idIndexMarker212"/> has some symbols indicating the beginning of the comment, and it continues for the rest of that line. These can be inserted on a separate line or at the end of a line with code that will execute.</p>
			<p>As a part of the language syntax, the symbol used to indicate the beginning of these comments is defined. Some are common, even if some languages will use more obscure variants.</p>
			<p>The most common symbol used by many languages is a double slash, <code>//</code>, which is two slashes without any space between them. Even if this symbol is made up of two characters, it is treated as a single symbol. </p>
			<p>The languages that use this method for line comments include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Go</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>Kotlin</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Another common symbol used by a number of languages is the hash symbol, <code>#</code>. Despite being a different symbol, it is handled in the same way as the double slash.</p>
			<p>The hash symbol is used for line<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> comments by languages such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Perl</li>
				<li>Python </li>
				<li>Ruby</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some languages have other ways to indicate a comment. In BASIC, the abbreviation <code>'</code>. </p>
			<p>The <code>⍝</code>.</p>
			<p>Ada and Lua are two languages that use double hyphens, <code>--</code>, to indicate a line comment. </p>
			<p>Haskell also uses this. Haskell also has another unique way to handle comments, called <code>&gt;</code>. All other lines are considered to be comments. </p>
			<p>Pascal, and languages closely related to Pascal, such as Modula-2, use <code>(*</code> to indicate the beginning of a comment and <code>*)</code> to mark the end.</p>
			<p>Languages that are related to Lisp, such as Common Lisp and Clojure, use a semicolon, <code>;</code>, to indicate line comments.</p>
			<p>Using line comments can look like this:</p>
			<pre>result = 4 + 5 //Adds 4 and 5 and stores the sum</pre>
			<p>The first part is the normal code that will be executed, but as soon as the compiler or interpreter sees the comment symbol, <code>//</code>, it will ignore the rest of this line.</p>
			<p>The same code in a language that uses the hash symbol for comments will look like this:</p>
			<pre>result = 4 + 5 # Adds 4 and 5 and stores the sum</pre>
			<p>These comments can also be on a separate line like this:</p>
			<pre>// Adds 4 and 5 and stores the sum
result = 4 + 5 </pre>
			<p>Alternatively, the <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>comments can also appear like this:</p>
			<pre># Adds 4 and 5 and stores the sum
result = 4 + 5 </pre>
			<p>This separation will depend on the language.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, we want a comment to span multiple lines. Instead of having a line comment symbol at the start of every line in the comment, we can use block comments.</p>
			<h3>Block comments</h3>
			<p>Block comments <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>have one symbol that indicates the beginning of the comment and another symbol that marks the end.</p>
			<p>Languages that use the double slash symbol for line comments will often use <code>/*</code> to indicate the beginning of a block comment and <code>*/</code> to indicate the end. Languages that use these symbols include the following, among others:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Go</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Perl uses <code>=begin</code> to indicate the start of a block comment and <code>=cut</code> to mark the end.</p>
			<p>Ruby has a similar concept, with <code>=begin</code> and <code>=end</code> marking the beginning and end, respectively.</p>
			<p>Python does not have a<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> block comment but, instead, something called a <code>'''</code> or <code>"""</code>. They end with the same three characters that were used at the beginning. So, use three single quotes to end the comment if you used single quotes at the beginning; otherwise, use three double quotes.</p>
			<p>In code, a block comment can look something like this if we use <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>:</p>
			<pre>/* Program that receives a signal
   from a mobile phone, checks the local time,
   and sunset time and if it is after sunset
   turns on the outside light. */
wait_for_phone_signal()
current_time = get_time()
sunset_time = get_sunset_time()
if current_time &gt; sunset_time then
    turn_on_light()
end_if</pre>
			<p>A programmer can also use several commonly used tags within comments to indicate certain things.</p>
			<h3>Tags</h3>
			<p>Sometimes, a programmer <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>wants to mark a section in the code using a tag so that it is easy to find this location. These tags are informal, but some are commonly used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>BUG</code>: A known bug in the code that should be corrected. </li>
				<li><code>FIXME</code>: Either a known bug or something else that must be corrected.</li>
				<li><code>HACK</code>: Marking a section of code that is not structured or written optimally and should be rewritten.</li>
				<li><code>TODO</code>: This marks a location where something will be inserted later.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These tags are written in comments and are mainly used so that they can be found with tools such as the Unix grep tool (a tool for searching in text files). Some programming editors will even highlight some of these tags.</p>
			<p>Comments can also be used to remove code.</p>
			<h3>Commenting out code</h3>
			<p>Sometimes, a programmer <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>needs to remove a couple of lines of code to try something out or to isolate a bug. Instead of deleting these lines, they can be commented out with either a line comment or block comments. It is then easy to remove the comment symbol to make the code active again.</p>
			<p>This technique can also be used if we are rewriting a code section. In that case, it is a good idea to have the old code as a reference when we are constructing the new code, so we don't forget something we need to do. We can place the old code in a comment; however, when we are done, we should remove the old commented out code as it will distract us when reading the code.</p>
			<p>The compiler or interpreter will ignore most comments, but not all. Some might have a special directive meaning.</p>
			<h3>Directive comments</h3>
			<p>There are some <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>examples where a comment can have a meaning for the language compiler or interpreter. </p>
			<p>Some languages, such as Python, can if we use it on a Unix system and use a symbol that looks like a comment on the first line in a code file. This <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>symbol is called a <em class="italic">shebang</em> and is made up of the hash symbol followed by an exclamation mark, <code>#!</code>.</p>
			<p>This is used as an instruction, not to other humans, but to the Python interpreter so that it knows what version of Python should be used to interpret this program.</p>
			<p>Python also has something called<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> a <em class="italic">magic comment</em>, which identifies the character encoding that the source code file is using. It begins with <code># -*- coding:</code> and ends with <code>-*-</code>.</p>
			<p>A Python program using both directives can start with two lines that look something like this:</p>
			<pre>#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-</pre>
			<p>As Python uses <code>#</code> as the symbol for line comments, it might look like these are two normal comments. This can be a bit confusing when reading the code, and we should be aware that these are instructions to the interpreter and not to humans.</p>
			<p>As you can see, comments can be used in several different ways. Let's take a look at some typical uses in more detail.</p>
			<h3>Making use of comments</h3>
			<p>How to use comments<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> in the best way is subject to dispute, and, often, you will get conflicting advice. Let's examine some typical uses before we discuss some of the opinions people have regarding comments.</p>
			<h4>Planning and reviewing</h4>
			<p>Comments can be used to plan <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>the structure of the code before it is written. When writing an<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> intricate part of an application, some people prefer to map out the logic with comments before focusing on the real code. </p>
			<h4>Code description</h4>
			<p>One everyday use of <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>comments is to summarize what a section of code is doing and explain the programmer's intent. You should not use comments to rewrite what the code does in English. If you feel that you need to do that, the code is most likely too complicated and should be revised.</p>
			<h4>Algorithmic description</h4>
			<p>Sometimes, we implement <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>complex algorithms that need an explanation with maybe both text and diagrams. This is usually the prerequisite knowledge required to be able to understand the code. This can, sometimes, be rather extensive explanations. Look at the following diagram as an example. This comment is taken from a part of the Python language itself. If we count the number of lines that are comments in that module, we will see that they are over 77%:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15554_05_15.jpg" alt="Figure 5.14: Example of comment describing the process.py module in the &#13;&#10;Python programming language"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.14: Example of comment describing the process.py module in the Python programming language</p>
			<p>The Python language is open source, so anyone can look at or download the code for it. If you want to see what the code for a programming language looks like, you can view it at <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">https://github.com/python/cpython</a>.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Comments controversy</strong></p>
			<p>There is a never-ending <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>debate regarding how and when comments should be used. Some people argue that code should be written using few comments, arguing that the source code should be written in a way so that it is self-explanatory or self-documenting. The motivation for this standpoint is that if you know a language, you should be able to understand the intent by just reading the code. If you can't, the code needs to be rewritten.</p>
			<p>Others will argue that code should be extensively commented, as per the example in the preceding diagram.</p>
			<p>In between these standpoints, you <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>will find some that argue that comments, by themselves, are not beneficial nor harmful and should be used with care where they provide added value. </p>
			<p>So, to sum it up, in this section, we learned that comments are a tool to explain the code. But they are also used for documentation. Additionally, tags can be used to make notes of things that need to be dealt with in the future. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed the most fundamental concept that we have in programming: a sequence.</p>
			<p>Sequential thinking can help us structure our ideas so that we can break them down into smaller pieces. As we have mentioned in this chapter, grasping everything a program needs to do can be hard, so we need a way to be able to focus on the details without losing the overview of what the program needs to do.</p>
			<p>The concept of doing things in sequence is also at the very heart of any program, since the instructions we write are executed one after the other. This is important because we need to make sure that these instructions come in the right order.</p>
			<p>The instructions we write are made up of statements, and we learned that some statements are short and simple, while others can span several lines and be made up of other statements. Some are smaller building blocks, called expressions. We are now on an abstraction level where we can deal with details such as adding two numbers together.</p>
			<p>Breaking down the code into smaller and smaller chunks allows us to think about how to structure our solution. Sometimes, we will need to document our line of thought to help us or other readers of our code see what made us choose this solution. We learned that comments can be used for this. </p>
			<p>Comments can also be used as a documentation of the code so that it is clear what it does and how it can be used. Additionally, we saw that comments can be directed to the language compiler or interpreter to give instructions to it. </p>
			<p>As we know from previous chapters, a computer program takes data as its input, stores it in memory, processes this data, and produces new data as its output. Data is a key concept, so, in the next chapter, we will learn how to interact with it and why this type of data has such importance.</p>

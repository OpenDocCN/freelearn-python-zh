    applications. It is written in and is programmable in Python. It comprises libraries,
    applications, and reusable examples.

    to the work of many developers who have been using the framework. We thank them
    all.

- en: web2py has evolved rapidly in the last two years, so much so that it has been
    difficult to keep the official documentation current. Although web2py is always
    backwards-compatible, new APIs have been created, providing new ways to solve
    old problems.

    wikis, blogs, and mailing lists. Two resources, in particular, have been very
    valuable to web2py users: the web2py Google Group and the [http://www.web2pyslices.com/website](http://www.web2pyslices.com/website).
    Yet the quality of the information provided there varies, as some of the recipes
    have become outdated.'

    it, and separate the important and recurrent problems that users try to solve
    from other issues, which do not represent the general interest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most recurrent problems encountered by users include deploying web2py in
    a production-ready configuration, building complex applications using reusable
    components, generating PDF reports, customizing forms and authentication, using
    third-party libraries (jQuery plugins in particular), and interfacing with third-party
    web services.

    than a year. More people than the listed authors have knowingly and unknowingly
    contributed. Some of the code used here is, in fact, based on code already published
    online, although that code has been refactored, tested, and documented better
    here.

    code should follow a style convention called PEP 8\. We have followed that convention
    for the code posted online, but we have compressed the listings in the printed
    book in order to follow the Packt style guide, and reduce the need for wrapping
    long lines.

    and experienced ones. Our goal is still to make the web a more open and accessible
    place. We contribute by providing web2py and its documentation to enable anyone
    to build new infrastructure and services with agility and efficiency.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Deploying web2py"), *Deploying web2py*. In
    this chapter, we discuss how to configure various web servers to work with web2py.
    This is a necessary setup for a production environment. We consider the most popular
    servers, such as Apache, Cherokee, Lighttpd, Nginx, CGI, and IIS. The corresponding
    recipes provide examples of usage of the different adapters, such as `mod_wsgi,
    FastCGI, uWSGI`, and `ISAPI`. Therefore, they can easily be extended to many other
    web servers. Using a production web server guarantees speedier serving of static
    files, better concurrency, and enhanced logging capabilities.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Building Your First Application"), *Building
    Your First Application*. We guide the reader through the process of creating a
    few non-trivial applications, including a `Contacts` application, a `Reddit` clone,
    and a `Facebook` clone. Each of these applications provides user authentication,
    multiple tables connected by relations, and Ajax functionality. In the second
    part of the chapter, we discuss further customization of generic web2py applications,
    such as building a plugin to serve flat pages, adding a logo to the header, customizing
    the menu, and allowing users to select their preferred language. The main focus
    of this chapter is on modularity and reusability.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Database Abstraction Layer"), *Database Abstraction
    Layer*. The DAL is arguably the most important component of web2py. In this chapter,
    we discuss various ways to import models and data from existing sources (csv files,
    `mysql`, and `postgresql` databases), and how to create new models. We deal with
    recurrent situations, such as tagging data and efficiently searching the database
    using tags. We implement a tree representation using the pre-order tree traversal
    method. We demonstrate how to work around some of the limitations of the Google
    App Engine platform.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Advanced Forms"), *Advanced Forms*. One of
    the strengths of web2py is its ability to automatically generate forms from the
    data representation. Yet, inevitably, the most demanding users feel the need to
    customize these forms. In this chapter, we provide examples of typical customizations,
    such as adding buttons, adding an upload progress bar, adding tooltips, and adding
    thumbnails for uploaded images. We also show how to create wizard forms and add
    multiple forms on one page.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Adding Ajax Effects"), *Adding Ajax Effects*.
    This chapter is an extension of the previous one. Here we further enhance forms
    and tables, using various jQuery plugins to make them more interactive using Ajax.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Using Third-party Libraries"), *Using Third-party
    Libraries*. web2py can use any Python third-party library. In this chapter we
    give some examples by using libraries that ship with web2py (feedparser, `rss)`
    as well as libraries that do not (matplotlib). We also provide a recipe that allows
    customized logging at the application-level, and an application that can retrieve
    and display Twitter feeds.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Web Services"), *Web Services. Computers
    can talk to each other through protocols, such as JSON, JSONRPC, XMLRPC , and
    SOAP*. In this chapter, we provide recipes that allow web2py to both create services
    based on these protocols and consume services provided by others. In particular,
    we provide example of integration with Flex, Paypal, Flickr , and GIS.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Authentication and Authorization"), *Authentication
    and Authorization*. web2py has a built-in Auth module that deals with authentication
    and authorization. In this chapter, we show various ways to customize it, including
    adding CAPTCHA to registration and login forms, adding Globally Recognized Avatars
    (gravatars) for representing users, and integrating with services using OAuth
    2.0 (for example Facebook). We also show how to utilize the `teacher/students`
    mode.'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Routing Recipes"), *Routing Recipes*. This
    chapter includes recipes for exposing web2py actions using shorten, cleaner, and
    legacy URLs. For example, adding a prefix to, or omitting the application name
    from the URLs. We also show advanced uses of the web2py router mechanism to handle
    special characters in the URL, use the URL to specify a preferred language, and
    map special files, such as `favicons.ico` and `robots.txt`.'

- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Reporting Recipes"), *Reporting Recipes*.
    There are many ways to create reports in web2py using standard Python libraries,
    such as `reportlab` or `latex`. Yet for the convenience of the users web2py ships
    with `pyfpdf`, a library created by *Mariano Reingart* to convert HTML directly
    to PDF. This chapter presents recipes to create PDF reports, listings, labels,
    badges, and invoices using the web2py template system and the `pyfpdf` library.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Other Tips and Tricks"), *Other Tips and
    Tricks*. Here we look at those recipes that did not fit into any other chapter,
    and yet were considered important by typical web2py users. An example is how to
    use web2py with Eclipse, a very popular Java IDE that works with Python. Other
    examples include how to develop applications that are mobile-friendly, and how
    to develop standalone applications that use a wxPython GUI.'

    of Python to kids. This book uses several mini projects so that kids can learn
    how to solve problems using Python.

- en: Python has grown to become a very popular language for programming web apps,
    analyzing data, and teaching people how to write code. Python is known for being
    a simple language to use because it is read much like natural languages, yet it
    is able to do data analysis very quickly, making it a great language to create
    websites that handle a lot of data. Another nice thing about Python that makes
    it fun to use is that people have been working on game libraries, such as pygame,
    so that people can create graphics programs with Python. The use of simple graphics
    to make short games is a fun way to learn programming constructs and is especially
    good for visual learners.

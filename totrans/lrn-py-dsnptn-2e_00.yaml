- en: Design patterns are among the most powerful methods of building large software
    systems. With an increasing focus on optimized software architecture and design,
    it is important that software architects think about optimizations in object creation,
    code structure, and interaction between objects at the architecture or design
    level. This makes sure that the cost of software maintenance is low, and code
    can be easily reused and is adaptable to change. Moreover, providing frameworks
    for reusability and separation of concerns is key to software development today.

    "Chapter 1. Introduction to Design Patterns"), *Introduction to Design Patterns*,
    goes through the basics of object-oriented programming and discusses object-oriented
    design principles in detail. This chapter gives a brief introduction to the concept
    of design patterns so that you will be able to appreciate the context and application
    of design patterns in software development.'

    "Chapter 2. The Singleton Design Pattern"), *The Singleton Design Pattern*, covers
    one of the simplest and well-known Creational design patterns used in application
    development—the Singleton design pattern. The different ways in which we can create
    a Singleton pattern in Python are also covered in this chapter along with examples.
    This chapter also covers the Monostate (or Borg) design pattern, which is a variant
    of the Singleton design pattern.'

    Factory Pattern – Building Factories to Create Objects*, discusses another creational
    pattern, the Factory pattern. You will also learn about the Factory Method pattern
    and Abstract Factory pattern with a UML diagram, real-world scenarios, and Python
    v3.5 implementations.'

    – Being Adaptive with Façade*, shows you another type of design pattern, the Structural
    design pattern. We will be introduced to the concept of Façade and learn how it
    is applicable to software design with the help of the Façade design pattern. You''ll
    also learn its implementation with a sample Python application using a real-world
    scenario.'

    – Controlling Object Access*, deals with the Proxy pattern that falls into the
    category of Structural design patterns. We will be introduced to the Proxy as
    a concept and discuss the design pattern and see how it is used in software application
    development. You''ll also learn about the different variants of the Proxy pattern—Virtual
    Proxy, Smart Proxy, Remote Proxy, and Protective Proxy.'

    Pattern – Keeping Objects in the Know*, talks about the third type of design pattern—the
    behavioral design pattern. We will be introduced to the Observer design pattern
    with examples. In this chapter, you''ll learn how to implement the Push and Pull
    models of the Observer pattern and the principles of loose coupling. We''ll also
    see how this pattern is critical when it comes to applying it to cloud applications
    and distributed systems.'

    – Encapsulating Invocation*, tells you about the Command design pattern. We will
    be introduced to the Command design pattern and discuss how it is used in software
    application development with a real-world scenario and Python implementation.
    We will also study two main aspects of the Command pattern—an implementation of
    redo/rollback operations and asynchronous task execution.'

    Method Pattern – Encapsulating Algorithm*, discusses the Template design pattern.
    Like the Command pattern, the Template pattern falls into the category of Behavioral
    patterns. Here, we discuss the Template method pattern, and you will learn about
    Hooks with an implementation. We''ll also cover the Hollywood principle that helps
    us appreciate this pattern better.'

    – Compound Patterns*, talks about Compound patterns. We will be introduced to
    the Model-View-Controller design pattern and discuss how it is used in software
    application development. MVC is easily one of the most used design patterns; in
    fact, many Python frameworks are based on this principle. You will learn about
    the details of MVC implementation with an example application written in Python
    Tornado (a framework used by Facebook).'

    in software application development.'

- en: This book introduces the terminology of the object-oriented paradigm. It focuses
    on object-oriented design with step-by-step examples. It guides us from simple
    inheritance, one of the most useful tools in the object-oriented programmer's
    toolbox, through exception handling to design patterns, an object-oriented way
    of looking at object-oriented concepts.

- en: Along the way, we'll learn how to integrate the object-oriented and the not-so-object-oriented
    aspects of the Python programming language. We will learn the complexities of
    string and file manipulation, emphasizing the difference between binary and textual
    data.

    frameworks. Finally, we'll explore, through Python's various concurrency paradigms,
    how to make objects work well together at the same time.

- en: This book specifically targets people who are new to object-oriented programming.
    It assumes you have basic Python skills. You'll learn object-oriented principles
    in depth. It is particularly useful for system administrators who have used Python
    as a *glue* language and would like to improve their programming skills.

    languages, then this book will help you understand the idiomatic ways to apply
    your knowledge in the Python ecosystem.

- en: This book is loosely divided into four major parts. In the first four chapters,
    we will dive into the formal principles of object-oriented programming and how
    Python leverages them. In [Chapter 5](42cd7e16-073b-485c-8073-554ac64d992f.xhtml), *When
    to Use Object*-*Oriented Programming*, through [Chapter 8](9a6335a2-1c69-4fa8-a685-02bbeeba23be.xhtml), *Strings
    and Serialization*, we will cover some of Python's idiosyncratic applications
    of these principles by learning how they are applied to a variety of Python's
    built-in functions. [Chapter 9](0abbcae0-eb3f-4237-adda-32765e1cce32.xhtml), *The
    Iterator Pattern*, through [Chapter 11](8f3d1c0f-4a63-4d06-8fb2-ad4dfe2669a3.xhtml), *Python
    Design Patterns II*, cover design patterns, and the final two chapters discuss
    two bonus topics related to Python programming that may be of interest.

    as abstraction, classes, encapsulation, and inheritance. We also briefly look

    are not using Python 2.7 or earlier. At the time of writing, Python 3.7 was the
    latest release of Python. Many examples will work on earlier revisions of Python
    3, but you'll likely experience a lot of frustration if you're using anything
    older than 3.5.

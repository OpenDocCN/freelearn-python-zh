- en: The aim of this book is to show you how to develop a web application using industry
    best practices and place it in a running production environment. We’ll do this
    by creating a working to-do app. This app is live at `tozo.dev`, and all the code
    for it is available under the MIT license at [github.com/pgjones/tozo](http://github.com/pgjones/tozo).

- en: The development blueprint presented in this book is based on one I’ve used to
    successfully build apps before, including for my own start-up a few years ago.
    The technology used here has been chosen because of its popularity in the industry,
    with Python, NodeJS, and Terraform being popular tools for full-stack development,
    and AWS being a popular cloud infrastructure provider.

- en: I started writing this book as the guide I wish I’d had when I started my full-stack
    engineering career. I’ve tried to answer as many of the questions that I had when
    I started and introduce much of the vocabulary I was missing. Over the past year,
    I’ve been refining and using this blueprint to help guide and develop junior engineers
    in their first industrial jobs. I hope it helps you to build great apps too!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for software engineers who already know how to program (such as
    recent computer science or bootcamp graduates) and want to learn how to build
    an app following industry processes (for example, using continuous integration
    and deployment).

    the App*, we’ll adopt industry best practices to secure the app and package it
    for the app stores, which includes adding multi-factor authentication and meeting
    the requirements to be a progressive web app.

    This means we’ll need to install tooling to autoformat, lint, and test our code,
    alongside using Git for version control and Terraform to manage the infrastructure.

<h3 id="toc_1">3.1 What to Install</h3>
<p class="my_basic">For the purposes of this book, you need to install Python and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your computer. IDLE and Visual Studio Code are examples of such IDEs. It's up to you to choose which one you are going to use. If you have decided to use IDLE, then you can skip setting up Visual Studio Code.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>If you are unsure which IDE to choose (IDLE or Visual Studio Code), the answer is simple. IDLE is light, simple, suitable for novice programmers and very easy to install. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, is more complex, suitable for programmers who are a bit more advanced and requires a bit more effort to set up.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>On Windows, IDLE is installed along with Python and requires no further configuration.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Python and IDLE are included by default in many Linux distributions, but not necessarily in all of them. For example, in Ubuntu Linux, Python is installed by default, but you may need to install the IDLE module separately.</p>

<p class="my_basic">All the instructions you need regarding how to set up Python, and IDLE or Visual Studio Code, on either Windows or Linux are maintained on my website at the following addresses. This gives me the flexibility to review them frequently and keep them up-to-date.</p>

<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Currently, all you need is to install Python and an IDE. Instructions on my website regarding how to write, execute, and debug a Python program are unnecessary at this stage. You will require these instructions when you reach <a href="chapter09.html">Chapter 9</a>.</p>

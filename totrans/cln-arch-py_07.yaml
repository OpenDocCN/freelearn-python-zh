    layer of our task management system and implemented entities, value objects, and
    domain services that encapsulate our core business rules. While this gives us
    a solid foundation, business rules alone don’t make a usable application. We need
    a way to coordinate these domain objects to fulfill user needs such as creating
    tasks, managing projects, and handling notifications. This is where the **Application
    layer** comes in.

- en: The Application layer acts as the conductor in our Clean Architecture orchestra.
    It coordinates domain objects and external services to accomplish specific use
    cases while maintaining the strict boundary between our business rules and the
    outside world. By implementing this layer correctly, we create applications that
    are not only functional but also maintainable and adaptable to change.

- en: In this chapter, we’ll explore how to implement an effective Application layer
    using our task management system as an example. We’ll see how to create use cases
    that orchestrate domain objects while maintaining clean architectural boundaries.
    You’ll learn how to implement request and response models that clearly define
    use case boundaries, and how to manage dependencies on external services without
    compromising architectural integrity.

    In [*Chapter 4*](Chapter_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor091), we saw how domain entities
    hide their internal state and implementation details. The Application layer extends
    this principle across architectural boundaries, hiding infrastructure details
    from the domain and domain complexities from external interfaces. This deliberate
    hiding of information is what makes the additional effort of creating ports, adapters,
    and request/response models worthwhile. By exposing only what’s necessary through
    carefully designed interfaces, we create a system where components can evolve
    independently yet work together seamlessly.'

    on how it orchestrates domain objects and coordinates with external services to
    fulfill user needs. We learned how to implement use cases that maintain clean
    architectural boundaries while providing meaningful functionality.
  prefs: []

- en: Through our task management system example, we discovered how to create use
    case interactors that coordinate domain objects while respecting the Dependency
    Rule introduced in [*Chapter 1*](Chapter_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015). We built
    upon the SOLID principles from [*Chapter 2*](Chapter_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040)
    and the type-awareness patterns from [*Chapter 3*](Chapter_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor060)
    to create robust, maintainable implementations. Our use cases effectively orchestrate
    the domain objects and services we developed in [*Chapter 4*](Chapter_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor091),
    showing how Clean Architecture layers work together harmoniously.

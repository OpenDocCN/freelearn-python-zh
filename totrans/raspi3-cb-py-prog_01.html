<p>The Raspberry Pi is a single-board computer created by the <strong>Raspberry Pi Foundation</strong>, a charity formed with the primary purpose of re-introducing low-level computer skills to children in the UK. The aim was to rekindle the microcomputer revolution of the 1980s, which produced a whole generation of skilled programmers.</p>
<p>Even before the computer was released at the end of February 2012, it was clear that Raspberry Pi had gained a huge following worldwide and, at the time of writing this book, has sold over 10 million units. The following image shows several different Raspberry Pi models:</p>

<p>The name, Raspberry Pi, was a combination of the desire to create an alternative computer with a fruit-based name (such as Apple, BlackBerry, and Apricot) and a nod to the original concept of a simple computer that could be programmed using <strong>Python</strong> (shortened to <strong>Pi</strong>).</p>
<p>In this book, we will take this little computer, find out how to set it up, and then explore its capabilities chapter by chapter, using the Python programming language.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Why Python?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>It is often asked, "Why has Python been selected as the language to use on Raspberry Pi?" The fact is that Python is just one of the many programming languages that can be used on Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>There are many programming languages that you can choose, from high-level graphical block programming, such as <strong>Scratch</strong>, to traditional <strong>C</strong>, right down to <strong>BASIC</strong>, and even the raw <strong>machine code assembler</strong>. A good programmer often has to be code multilingual to be able to play to the strengths and weaknesses of each language to best meet the needs of their desired application. It is useful to understand how different languages (and programming techniques) try to overcome the challenge of converting <em>what you want</em> into <em>what you get</em>, as this is what you are trying to do as well while you program.</p>
<p>Python has been selected as a good place to start when learning about programming, as it provides a rich set of coding tools while still allowing simple programs to be written without fuss. This allows beginners to gradually be introduced to the concepts and methods on which modern programming languages are based without requiring them to know it all from the start. It is very modular with lots of additional libraries that can be imported to quickly extend the functionality. You will find that, over time, this encourages you to do the same, and you will want to create your own modules that you can plug into your own programs, thus taking your first steps into structured programming.</p>
<p>Python addresses formatting and presentation concerns. As indentation will add better readability, indents matter a lot in Python. They define how blocks of code are grouped together. Generally, Python is slow; since it is interpreted, it takes time to create a module while it is running the program. This can be a problem if you need to respond to time-critical events. However, you can precompile Python or use modules written in other languages to overcome this.</p>
<p>It hides the details; this is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It is excellent for beginners but can be difficult when you have to second-guess aspects such as datatypes. However, this in turn forces you to consider all the possibilities, which can be a good thing.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>A massive source of confusion for beginners is that there are two versions of Python on Raspberry Pi (<strong>Version 2.7</strong> and <strong>Version 3.6</strong>), which are not compatible with each other, so code written for Python 2.7 may not run with Python 3.6 (and vice versa).</p>
<p>The <strong>Python Software Foundation</strong> is continuously working to improve and move forward with the language, which sometimes means they have to sacrifice backward compatibility to embrace new improvements (and, importantly, remove redundant and legacy ways of doing things).</p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="packt_screen">Supporting Python 2 and Python 3</span><br/>
<br/>
<span>There are many tools that will ease the transition from Python 2 to Python 3, including converters such as</span> <kbd>2to3</kbd><span>, which will parse and update your code to use Python 3 methods. This process is not perfect, and in some cases you'll need to manually rewrite sections and fully retest everything. You can write the code and libraries that will support both. The</span> <kbd>import __future__</kbd> <span>statement allows you to import the friendly methods of Python 3 and run them using Python 2.7.</span></div>

<p>Essentially, the selection of which version to use will depend on what you intend to do. For instance, you may require Python 2.7 libraries, which are not yet available for Python 3.6. Python 3 has been available since 2008, so these tend to be older or larger libraries that have not been translated. In many cases, there are new alternatives to legacy libraries; however, their support can vary.</p>
<p>In this book, we have used Python 3.6, which is also compatible with Python 3.5 and 3.3.</p>

<p>Since its release, Raspberry Pi has come in various iterations, featuring both small and large updates and improvements to the original Raspberry Pi Model B unit. Although it can be confusing at first, there are three basic types of Raspberry Pi available (and one special model).</p>
<p>The main flagship model is called <strong>Model B</strong>. This has all the connections and features, as well as the maximum RAM and the latest processor. Over the years, there have been several versions, most notably Model B (which had 256 MB and then 512 MB RAM) and then Model B+ (which increased the 26-pin GPIO to 40 pins, switched to using a microSD card slot, and had four USB ports instead of two). These original models all used the Broadcom BCM2835 <strong>system on chip</strong> (<strong><span>SOC</span></strong>), consisting of a single core 700 MHz ARM11 and VideoCore IV <strong>graphical processing unit</strong> (<strong><span>GPU</span></strong>).</p>
<p>The release of Raspberry Pi 2 Model B (also referred to as 2B) in 2015 introduced a new Broadcom BCM2836 SOC, providing a quad-core 32-bit ARM Cortex A7 1.2 GHz processor and GPU, with 1 GB of RAM. The improved SOC added support for Ubuntu and Windows 10 IoT. Finally, we had the latest Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, using another new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC, which provides a quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 and GPU, alongside on-board Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>Model A</strong> has always been targeted as a cut-down version. While having the same SOC as Model B, there are limited connections consisting of a single USB port and no wired network (LAN). Model A+ again added more GPIO pins and a microSD slot. However, the RAM was later upgraded to 512 MB of RAM and again there was only a single USB port/no LAN. The Broadcom BCM2835 SOC on Model A has not been updated so far (so is still a single core ARM11); however, a Model 3A (most likely using the BCM2837).</p>
<p>The <strong>Pi Zero</strong> is an ultra-compact version of Raspberry Pi intended for embedded applications where cost and space are a premium. It has the same 40-pin GPIO and microSD card slot as the other models, but lacks the on-board display (CSI and DSI) connection. It does still have HDMI (via a mini-HDMI) and a single micro USB <strong>on-the-go</strong> (<strong><span>OTG</span></strong>) connection. Although not present in the first revision of the Pi Zero, the most recent model also includes a CSI connection for the on-board camera.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Pi Zero was famously released in 2015 and was given away with Raspberry Pi foundation's magazine <em>The MagPi</em>, giving the magazine the benefit of being the first magazine to give away a computer on its cover! This did make me rather proud since (as you may have read in my biography at the start of this book) I was one of the founders of the magazine.</div>
<p>The special model is known as the <strong>compute module</strong>. This takes the form of a 200-pin SODIMM card. It is intended for industrial use or within commercial products, where all the external interfaces would be provided by a host/motherboard, into which the module would be inserted. Example products include the Slice Media Player (<a href="http://fiveninjas.com">http://fiveninjas.com</a>) and the OTTO camera. The current module uses the BCM2835, although an updated compute module (CM3).</p>

<p>All sections of this book are compatible will all current versions of Raspberry Pi, but Model 3B is recommended as the best model to start with. This offers the best performance (particularly useful for the GPU examples in <a href="0796b645-246a-463a-a52c-ec76a81e7512.xhtml" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 7</span></a>, <em>Creating 3D Graphics</em>, and the OpenCV examples used in <a href="f4dead87-95fc-4a6e-af39-4b46b1493cb3.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Detecting Edges and Contours in Images</em>), lots of connections, and built-in Wi-Fi, which can be very convenient.</p>
<p>Pi Zero is recommended for projects where you want low power usage or reduced weight/size but do not need the full processing power of Model 3B. However, due to its ultra-low cost, Pi Zero is ideal for deploying a completed project after you have developed it.</p>

<p>Before you can use your Raspberry Pi, you will need an SD card with an operating system installed or with the <strong>New Out Of Box System</strong> (<strong>NOOBS</strong>) on it, as discussed in the <em>Using NOOBS to set up your Raspberry Pi SD card</em> recipe.</p>
<p>The following section will detail the types of devices you can connect to Raspberry Pi and, importantly, how and where to plug them in.</p>
<p>As you will discover later, once you have your Raspberry Pi set up, you may decide to connect remotely and use it through a network link, in which case you only need power and a network connection. Refer to the following sections: <em>Connecting remotely to Raspberry Pi over the Network using VNC</em> and <em>Connecting Remotely to Raspberry Pi over the Network using SSH (and X11 Forwarding)</em>.</p>

<p>The layout of Raspberry Pi is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/323c235f-486c-4971-986c-16c78cb87e0b.jpg" width="1999" height="937"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">The Raspberry Pi connection layout (Model 3 B, Model A+, and Pi Zero)</div>
<p>More information about the preceding figure is listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Display</strong>: The Raspberry Pi supports the following three main display connections; if both HDMI and composite video are connected, it will default to HDMI only:
<ul>
<li><strong>HDMI</strong>: For best results, use a TV or monitor that has an HDMI connection, thus allowing the best resolution display (1080p) and also digital audio output. If your display has a DVI connection, you may be able to use an adapter to connect through the HDMI. There are several types of DVI connection; some support analogue (DVI-A), some digital (DVI-D), and some both (DVI-I). Raspberry Pi is only able to provide a digital signal through the HDMI, so an HDMI-to-DVI-D adapter is recommended (shown with a tick mark in the following screenshot). This lacks the four extra analogue pins (shown with a cross mark in the following screenshot), thus allowing it to fit into both DVI-D and DVI-I type sockets:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/bed2cae1-2bc2-428c-83d4-5c6223cefbbc.png" style="width:37.17em;height:12.00em;" width="1121" height="362"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">HDMI-to-DVI connection (DVI-D adaptor)</div>
<p style="padding-left: 120px">If you wish to use an older monitor (with a VGA connection), an additional HDMI-to-VGA converter is required. Raspberry Pi also supports a rudimentary VGA adaptor (VGA Gert666 Adaptor), which is driven directly off of the GPIO pins. However, this does use up all but four pins of the 40-pin header (older 26-pin models will not support the VGA output):</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/63fbf682-54ec-4ba1-8bb9-17ee97c47a3b.jpg" style="width:27.83em;height:23.25em;" width="483" height="403"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">HDMI-to-VGA adapter</div>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>Analogue</strong>: An alternative display method is to use the analogue composite video connection (via the phono socket); this can also be attached to an S-Video or European SCART adapter. However, the analogue video output has a maximum resolution of 640 x 480 pixels, so it is not ideal for general use:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/4837bee0-73a4-4f11-8584-fe4a654f2489.jpg" style="width:21.58em;height:7.00em;" width="1999" height="644"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">3.5 mm phono analogue connections</div>
<p style="padding-left: 120px">When using the RCA connection or a DVI input, audio has to be provided separately by the analogue audio connection. To simplify the manufacturing process (by avoiding through-hole components), the Pi Zero does not have analogue audio or an RCA socket for analogue video (although they can be added with some modifications):</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct Display DSI</strong>: A touch display produced by Raspberry Pi Foundation will connect directly into the DSI socket. This can be connected and used at the same time as the HDMI or analogue video output to create a dual display setup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stereo analogue audio (all except Pi Zero)</strong>: This provides an analogue audio output for headphones or amplified speakers. The audio can be switched via Raspberry Pi configuration tool on the desktop between analog (stereo socket) and digital (HDMI), or via the command line using <kbd>amixer</kbd> or <kbd>alsamixer</kbd>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">To find out more information about a particular command in the Terminal, you can use the following <kbd>man</kbd> command before the terminal reads the manual (most commands should have one):<br/>
<br/>
<kbd> man amixer</kbd><br/>
<br/>
Some commands also support the <kbd>--help</kbd> option for more concise help, shown as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<kbd> amixer --help</kbd></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network (excluding models A and Pi Zero)</strong>: The network connection is discussed in the <em>Networking and connecting your Raspberry Pi to the internet via the LAN connector</em> recipe later in this chapter. If we use the Model A Raspberry Pi, it is possible to add a USB network adapter to add wired or even wireless networking (refer to the <em>Networking and connecting your Raspberry Pi to the internet via a USB Wi-Fi dongle</em> recipe).</li>
<li><strong>Onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (Model 3 B only)</strong>: The Model 3 B has built-in 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1; see the <em>Using the built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on Raspberry Pi</em> recipe.</li>
<li><strong>USB (1x Model A/Zero, 2x Model 1 B, 4x Model 2 B and 3 B)</strong>: Using a keyboard and mouse:
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi should work with most USB keyboards and mice. You can also use wireless mice and keyboards, which use RF dongles. However, additional configuration is required for items that use the Bluetooth dongles.</li>
<li>If there is a lack of power supplied by your power supply or the devices are drawing too much current, you may experience the keyboard keys appearing to stick, and, in severe cases, corruption of the SD card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">USB power can be more of an issue with the early Model B revision 1 boards that were available prior to October 2012. They included additional <strong>Polyfuses</strong> on the USB output and tripped if an excess of 140 mA was drawn. The Polyfuses can take several hours or days to recover completely, thus causing unpredictable behavior to remain even when the power is improved.<br/>
<br/>
You can identify a revision 1 board, as it lacks the four mounting holes that are present in the later models.</div>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>Debian Linux (upon which Raspbian is based) supports many common USB devices, such as flash storage drives, hard-disk drives (external power may be required), cameras, printers, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi adapters. Some devices will be detected automatically, while others will require drivers to be installed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Micro USB power</strong>: The Raspberry Pi requires a 5V power supply that can comfortably supply at least 1,000 mA (1,500 mA or more is recommended, particularly with the more power-hungry Model 2 and Model 3) with a micro USB connection. It is possible to power the unit using portable battery packs, such as the ones suitable for powering or recharging tablets. Again, ensure that they can supply 5V at 1,000 mA or over.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should aim to make all other connections to Raspberry Pi before connecting the power. However, USB devices, audio, and networks may be connected and removed while it is running, without problems.</p>

<p>Each of the following connections provides additional interfaces for Raspberry Pi:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>20 x 2 GPIO pin header (Model A+, B+, 2 B, 3 B, and Pi Zero)</strong>: This is the main 40-pin GPIO header of Raspberry Pi used for interfacing directly with hardware components. We use this connection in <a href="f4dead87-95fc-4a6e-af39-4b46b1493cb3.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapters 6</a>, <em>Detecting Edges and Contours in Images</em>, <a href="0796b645-246a-463a-a52c-ec76a81e7512.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Creating 3D Graphics</em>, <a href="7cf87b89-8982-4d64-852c-ddfcbf742be5.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Using Python to Drive Hardware</em>, and <a href="18a915b2-803e-465d-a84a-0b9accdb54f2.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Sensing and Displaying Real-world Data</em>. The recipes in this book are also compatible with older models of Raspberry Pi that have a 13 x 2 GPIO pin header.</li>
<li><strong>P5 8 x 2 GPIO pin header (Model 1 B revision 2.0 only)</strong>: We do not use this in the book.</li>
<li><strong>Reset connection</strong>: This is present on later models (no pins fitted). A reset is triggered when Pin 1 (reset) and Pin 2 (GND) are connected together. We use this in the <em>A controlled shutdown button</em> recipe in <a href="7cf87b89-8982-4d64-852c-ddfcbf742be5.xhtml" target="_blank"><span class="ChapterrefPACKT">Chapter 9</span></a>, <em>Using Python to Drive Hardware</em>.</li>
<li><strong>GPU/LAN JTAG</strong>: The <strong>Joint Test Action Group</strong> (<strong>JTAG</strong>) is a programming and debugging interface used to configure and test processors. These are present on newer models as surface pads. A specialist JTAG device is required to use this interface. We do not use this in the book.</li>
<li><strong>Direct camera CSI</strong>: This connection supports Raspberry Pi Camera Module. Note that the Pi Zero has a smaller CSI connector than the other models, so it requires a different ribbon connector.</li>
<li><strong>Direct Display DSI</strong>: This connection supports a directly connected display, such as a 7-inch 800 x 600 capacitive touch screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Raspberry Pi requires the operating system to be loaded onto an SD card before it starts up. The easiest way to set up the SD card is to use <strong>NOOBS</strong>; you may find that you can buy an SD card with NOOBS already loaded on it.</p>
<p>NOOBS provides an initial start menu that provides options to install several of the available operating systems on to your SD card.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Since NOOBS creates a <strong>RECOVERY</strong> partition to keep the original installation images, an 8 GB SD card or larger is recommended. You will also need an SD card reader (experience has shown that some built-in card readers can cause issues, so an external USB type reader is recommended).</p>
<p>If you are using an SD card that you have used previously, you may need to reformat it to remove any previous partitions and data. NOOBS expects the SD card to consist of a single FAT32 partition.</p>
<p>If using Windows or macOS X, you can use the SD Association's formatter, as shown in the following screenshot (available at <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/</span></a>):</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/895c1424-aa96-4a13-9c7c-13fe0af431a4.png" style="width:49.33em;height:24.50em;" width="969" height="481"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Getting rid of any partitions on the SD card, using SD formatter</div>
<p>From the <span class="packt_screen">Option Setting</span> dialog box, set <span class="packt_screen">FORMAT SIZE ADJUSTMENT</span>. This will remove all the SD card partitions that were created previously.</p>
<p>If using Linux, you can use <kbd>gparted</kbd> to clear any previous partitions and reformat it as a FAT32 partition.</p>
<p>The full NOOBS package (typically just over 1 GB) contains Raspbian, the most popular Raspberry Pi operating system image built in. A lite version of NOOBS is also available that has no preloaded operating systems (although a smaller initial download of 20 MB and a network connection on Raspberry Pi are required to directly download the operating system you intend to use).</p>
<p>NOOBS is available at <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads</span></a>, with the documentation available at <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs"><span class="URLPACKT">https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs</span></a>.</p>

<p>By performing the following steps, we will prepare the SD card to run NOOBS. This will then allow us to select and install the operating system we want to use:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get your SD card ready.</li>
<li>On a freshly formatted or new SD card, copy the contents of the <kbd>NOOBS_vX.zip</kbd> file. When it has finished copying, you should end up with something like the following screenshot of the SD card:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/98031698-7bd6-4aed-b41a-43a6d375c3ad.png" width="180" height="223"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">NOOBS files extracted onto the SD card</div>
<div class="packt_infobox">The files may vary slightly with different versions of NOOBS, and the icons displayed may be different on your computer.</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>You can now put the card into your Raspberry Pi, connect it to a keyboard and display, and turn the power on. Refer to the <em>Connecting to Raspberry Pi</em> recipe for details on what you need, and how to do this.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, NOOBS will display via the HDMI connection. If you have another type of screen (or you don't see anything), you will need to manually select the output type by pressing <span class="KeyPACKT">1</span>, <span class="KeyPACKT">2</span>, <span class="KeyPACKT">3</span>, or <span class="KeyPACKT">4,</span> according to the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key 1 stands for the <span class="packt_screen">Standard HDMI</span> mode (the default mode)</li>
<li>Key 2 stands for the <span class="packt_screen">Safe HDMI</span> mode (alternative HDMI settings if the output has not been detected)</li>
<li>Key 3 stands for <span class="packt_screen">Composite PAL</span> (for connections made via the RCA analogue video connection)</li>
<li>Key 4 stands for <span class="packt_screen">Composite NTSC</span> (again, for connections via the RCA connector)</li>
</ul>
<p>This display setting will also be set for the installed operating system.</p>
<p>After a short while, you will see the NOOBS selection screen that lists the available distributions (the offline version only includes Raspbian). There are many more distributions that are available, but only the selected ones are available directly through the NOOBS system. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Raspbian</span>, as this is the operating system being used in this book.</p>
<p>Press <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Enter</span></em> or click on <span class="packt_screen">Install OS</span>, and confirm that you wish to overwrite all the data on<br/>
the card. This will overwrite any distributions previously installed using NOOBS but will not remove the NOOBS system; you can return to it at any time by pressing <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Shift</span></em> when you turn the power on.</p>
<p>It will take around 20 to 40 minutes to write the data to the card depending on its speed. When it completes and the <span class="packt_screen">Image Applied Successfully</span> message appears, click on <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>, and Raspberry Pi will start to boot into <kbd>Raspberry Pi Desktop</kbd>.</p>

<p>The purpose of writing the image file to the SD card in this manner is to ensure that the SD card is formatted with the expected filesystem partitions and files required to correctly boot the operating system.</p>
<p>When Raspberry Pi powers up, it loads some special code contained within the GPU's internal memory (commonly referred to as <strong>binary blob</strong> by Raspberry Pi Foundation). The binary blob provides the instructions required to read the <kbd>BOOT</kbd> partition on the SD card, which (in the case of a NOOBS install) will load NOOBS from the <kbd>RECOVERY</kbd> partition. If at this point <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Shift</span></em> is pressed, NOOBS will load the recovery and installation menu. Otherwise, NOOBS will begin loading the OS as specified by the preferences stored in the <kbd>SETTINGS</kbd> partition.</p>
<p>When loading the operating system, it will boot via the <kbd>BOOT</kbd> partition, using the settings defined in <kbd>config.txt</kbd> and options in <kbd>cmdline.txt</kbd> to finally load to the desktop on the <kbd>root</kbd> partition. Refer to the following diagram:</p>

<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">NOOBS creates several partitions on the SD card to allow the installation of multiple<br/>
operating systems and to provide recovery</div>
<p>NOOBS allows the user to optionally install multiple operating systems on the same card and provides a boot menu to choose between them (with an option to set a default value in the event of a time-out period).</p>
<p>If you later add, remove, or re-install an operating system, ensure first that you make a copy of any files, including system settings you wish to keep, as NOOBS may overwrite everything on the SD card.</p>

<p>When you power up Raspberry Pi for the first time directly, the desktop will be loaded. You can configure the system settings using the <span class="packt_screen">Raspberry Pi Configuration</span> menu (under the <span class="packt_screen">Preferences</span> menu on the Desktop or via the <kbd>sudo raspi-config</kbd> command).

<pre><strong>sudo shutdown -h now</strong>  </pre>
<p>Or, use this one:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo halt</strong>  </pre>
<p>You must wait until this command completes before you remove power from Raspberry Pi (wait for at least 10 seconds after the SD card access light has stopped flashing).</p>
<p>You can also restart the system with the <kbd>reboot</kbd> command, as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo reboot</strong>  </pre>

<p>An alternative to using NOOBS is to manually write the operating system image to the SD card. While this was originally the only way to install the operating system, some users still prefer it. It allows the SD cards to be prepared before they are used in Raspberry Pi. It can also provide easier access to startup and configuration files, and it leaves more space available for the user (unlike NOOBS, a <kbd>RECOVERY</kbd> partition isn't included).</p>
<p>The default Raspbian image actually consists of two partitions, <kbd>BOOT</kbd> and <kbd>SYSTEM</kbd>, which will fit into a 2 GB SD card (4 GB or more is recommended).</p>
<p>You need a computer running Windows/Mac OS X/Linux (although it is possible to use another Raspberry Pi to write your card; be prepared for a very long wait).</p>
<p>Download the latest version of the operating system you wish to use. For the purpose of this book, it is assumed you are using the latest version of Raspbian available at <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads</span></a>.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps depending on the type of computer you plan to use to write to the SD card (the <kbd>.img</kbd> file you need is sometimes compressed, so before you start, you will need to extract the file).</p>
<p>The following steps are for Windows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you have downloaded the Raspbian image, as previously detailed, and extracted it to a convenient folder to obtain an <kbd>.img</kbd> file.</li>
<li>Obtain the <kbd>Win32DiskImager.exe</kbd> file available at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager</span></a>.</li>
<li>Run <kbd>Win32DiskImager.exe</kbd> from your downloaded location.</li>
<li>Click on the folder icon and navigate to the location of the <kbd>.img</kbd> file and click on <span class="packt_screen">Save</span>.</li>
<li>If you haven't already done so, insert your SD card into your card reader and plug it into your computer.</li>
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Device</span> drive letter that corresponds to your SD card from the small drop-down box. Double-check that this is the correct device (as the program will overwrite whatever is on the device when you write the image).</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">The drive letter may not be listed until you select a source image file.</div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Finally, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Write</span> button and wait for the program to write the image to the SD card, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/e086099a-c257-4789-abec-4bf4c2b1bca2.png" style="width:31.17em;height:16.00em;" width="403" height="206"/></div>

<ol start="8">
<li>Once completed, you can exit the program. Your SD card is ready.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following steps should work for the most common Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and Debian:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using your preferred web browser, download the Raspbian image and save it in a suitable place.</li>
<li>Extract the file from the file manager or locate the folder in the terminal and unzip the <kbd>.img</kbd> file with the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>unzip filename.zip</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>If you haven't already done so, insert your SD card into your card reader and plug it into your computer.</li>
<li>Use the <kbd>df -h</kbd> command and identify the <strong>sdX</strong> identifier for the SD card. Each partition will be displayed as <span class="packt_screen">sdX1</span>, <span class="packt_screen">sdX2</span>, and so on, where <span class="packt_screen">X</span> will be <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>b</kbd>, <kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>d</kbd>, and so on for the device ID.</li>
<li>Ensure that all the partitions on the SD card are unmounted using the<br/>
<kbd>umount /dev/sdXn</kbd> command for each partition, where <kbd>sdXn</kbd> is the partition being unmounted.</li>
<li>Write the image file to the SD card, with the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo dd if=filename.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M</strong>  </pre>

<p>You can use <strong>Win32 Disk Imager</strong> to make a full backup image of your SD card by inserting your SD card into your reader, starting the program, and creating a filename to store the image in. Simply click on the <span class="packt_screen">Read</span> button instead to read the image from the SD card and write it to a new image file.</p>
<p>To make a backup of your system, or to clone to another SD card using Raspberry Pi, use the <span class="packt_screen">SD Card Copier</span> (available from the desktop menu via the <span class="packt_screen">Accessories</span> | <span class="packt_screen">SD Card Copier</span>).</p>
<p>Insert an SD card into a card reader into a spare USB port of Raspberry Pi and select the new storage device, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Many networks connect and configure themselves automatically using the <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</strong> (<strong>DHCP</strong>), which is controlled by the router or switch. If this is the case, simply plug the network cable into a spare network port on your router or network switch (or wall network socket if applicable).</p>
<p>Alternatively, if a DHCP server is not available, you shall have to configure the settings manually (refer to the <em>There's more...</em> section for details).</p>
<p>You can confirm this is functioning successfully with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the two LEDs on either side of Raspberry Pi light up (the left orange LED indicates a connection and the green LED on the right shows activity by flashing). This will indicate that there is a physical connection to the router and that the equipment is powered and functioning.</li>
<li>Test the link to your local network using the <kbd>ping</kbd> command. First, find out the IP address of another computer on the network (or the address of your router, perhaps, often <kbd>192.168.0.1</kbd> or <kbd>192.168.1.254</kbd>). Now, on the Raspberry Pi Terminal, use the <kbd>ping</kbd> command (the <kbd>-c 4</kbd> parameter is used to send just four messages; otherwise, press <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Ctrl</span></em> + <em><span class="KeyPACKT">C</span></em> to stop) to ping the IP address, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo ping 192.168.1.254 -c 4</strong></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Test the link to the internet (this will fail if you usually connect to the internet through a proxy server) as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo ping www.raspberrypi.org -c 4</strong>
  </pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Finally, you can test the link back to Raspberry Pi by discovering the<br/>
IP address using <kbd>hostname -I</kbd> on Raspberry Pi. You can then use the ping command on another computer on the network to ensure it is accessible (using Raspberry Pi's IP address in place of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">www.raspberrypi.org</span></a>). The Windows version of the <kbd>ping</kbd> command will perform five pings and stop automatically, and will not need the <kbd>-c 4</kbd> option.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the aforementioned tests fail, you will need to check your connections and then confirm the correct configuration for your network.</p>

<p>If you find yourself using your Raspberry Pi regularly on the network, you won't want to have to look up the IP address each time you want to connect to it.</p>
<p>On some networks, you may be able to use Raspberry Pi's hostname instead of its IP address (the default is <kbd>raspberrypi</kbd>). To assist with this, you may need some additional software, such as <strong>Bonjour</strong>, to ensure hostnames on the network are correctly registered. If you have macOS X, you will have Bonjour running already.</p>
<p>On Windows, you can either install iTunes (if you haven't got it), which also includes the service, or you can install it separately (via the Apple Bonjour Installer available from <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999">https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999</a>). Then you can use the hostname, <kbd>raspberrypi</kbd> or <kbd>raspberrypi.local</kbd>, to connect to Raspberry Pi over the network. If you need to change the hostname, then you can do so with the Raspberry Pi configuration tool, shown previously.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may find it helpful to fix the IP address to a known value by manually setting the IP address. However, remember to switch it back to use DHCP when connecting to another network.</p>
<p>Some routers will also have an option to set a <strong>Static IP DHCP address</strong>, so the same address is always given to Raspberry Pi (how this is set will vary depending on the router itself).</p>
<p>Knowing your Raspberry Pi's IP address or using the hostname is particularly useful if you intend to use one of the remote access solutions described later on, which avoids the need for a display.</p>

<p>Before you start, you will need to determine the network settings for your network.</p>
<p>You will need to find out the following information from your router's settings or another computer connected to the network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPv4 address</strong>: This address will need to be selected to be similar to other computers on the network (typically, the first three numbers should match, that is, <kbd>192.168.1.X</kbd> if <kbd>netmask</kbd> is <kbd>255.255.255.0</kbd>), but it should not already be used by another computer. However, avoid <kbd>x.x.x.255</kbd> as the last address, since this is reserved as a broadcast address.</li>
<li><strong>Subnet mask</strong>: This number determines the range of addresses the computer will respond to (for a home network, it is typically <kbd>255.255.255.0</kbd>, which allows up to 254 addresses). This is also sometimes referred to as the <strong>netmask</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Default gateway address</strong>: This address is usually your router's IP address, through which the computers connect to the internet.</li>
<li><strong>DNS servers</strong>: The <strong>Domain Name Service</strong> (<strong>DNS</strong>) server converts names into IP addresses by looking them up. Usually, they will already be configured on your router, in which case you can use your router's address. Alternatively, your <strong>Internet Service Provider</strong> (<strong>ISP</strong>) may provide some addresses, or you can use Google's public DNS servers at the addresses <kbd>8.8.8.8</kbd> and <kbd>8.8.4.4</kbd>. These are also called <strong>nameservers</strong> in some systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Windows, you can obtain this information by connecting to the internet and running the following command:</p>

<p>It is possible to connect Raspberry Pi LAN port directly to a laptop or computer using a single network cable. This will create a local network link between the computers, allowing all the things you can do if connected to a normal network without the need for a hub or a router, including connection to the internet, if <strong>Internet Connection Sharing</strong> (<strong>ICS</strong>) is used, as follows:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/ff605239-8efe-47d7-9912-8b925ebe0a52.png" style="width:31.92em;height:15.17em;" width="701" height="333"/></div>
<div class="packt_tip">Make use of Raspberry Pi, with just a network cable, a standard imaged SD card, and power.</div>
<p>ICS allows Raspberry Pi to connect to the internet through another computer. However, some additional configuration is required for the computers to communicate across the link, as Raspberry Pi does not automatically allocate its own IP address.</p>
<p>We will use the ICS to share a connection from another network link, such as a built-in Wi-Fi on a laptop. Alternatively, we can use a direct network link (refer to the <em>Direct network link</em> section under the <em>There's more...</em> section) if the internet is not required or if the computer has only a single network adapter.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Although this setup should work for most computers, some setups are more difficult than the others.

<p>First, we need to enable ICS on our network devices. In this case, we will be sharing the internet, which is available on <span class="packt_screen">Wireless Network Connection</span> through the <span class="packt_screen">Ethernet</span> connection to Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>For Windows, perform these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Return to the list of network adapters, right-click on the connection that links<br/>
to the internet (in this case, the <span class="packt_screen">WiFi</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Wireless Network Connection</span> device), and click on <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/18f97b8b-df58-4342-8723-619207dd2511.png" width="578" height="237"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Locating your wired network connection</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>At the top of the window, select the second tab (in Windows XP, it is called <span class="packt_screen">Advanced</span>; in Windows 7 and Windows 10, it is called <span class="packt_screen">Sharing</span>), as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/b9b9004d-ca91-4e8e-9d24-cfaea38019ab.png" style="width:25.08em;height:32.58em;" width="355" height="463"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Selecting the TCP/IP properties and noting the allocated IP address</div>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the <span class="packt_screen">Internet Connection Sharing</span> section, check the box for <span class="packt_screen">Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection</span> (if present, use the drop-down box to select the <span class="packt_screen">Home networking connection:</span> option as <span class="packt_screen">Ethernet</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Local Area Connection</span>). Click on <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> and confirm whether you previously had a fixed IP address set for <span class="packt_screen">Local Area Connection</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For macOS X, to enable the ICS, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">System Preferences</span> and then click on <span class="packt_screen">Sharing</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Internet Sharing</span> and select the connection from which we want to share the internet (in this case, it will be the Wi-Fi <span class="packt_screen">AirPort</span>). Then select the connection that we will connect Raspberry Pi to (in this case, <span class="packt_screen">Ethernet</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>For Linux to enable the ICS, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the <span class="packt_screen">System</span> menu, click on <span class="packt_screen">Preferences</span> and then on <span class="packt_screen">Network Connections</span>. Select the connection you want to share (in this case, <span class="packt_screen">Wireless</span>) and click on <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Configure</span>. In the <span class="packt_screen">IPv4 Settings</span> tab, change the <span class="packt_screen">Method</span> option to <span class="packt_screen">Shared to other computers</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The IP address of the network adapter will be the <strong>Gateway IP</strong> address to be used on Raspberry Pi, and will be assigned an IP address within the same range (it will all match, except the last number). For instance, if the computer's wired connection now has <kbd>192.168.137.1</kbd>, the Gateway IP of Raspberry Pi will be <kbd>192.168.137.1</kbd> and its own IP address might be set to <kbd>192.168.137.10</kbd>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to updates in the operating system, Raspbian will now automatically allocate a suitable IP address to join the network and set the gateway appropriately. However, unless we have a screen attached to Raspberry Pi or scan for devices on our network, we do not know what IP address Raspberry PI has given itself.</p>
<p>Fortunately (as mentioned in the <em>Networking and connecting your Raspberry Pi to the internet via the LAN connector</em> recipe in the <em>There's more...</em> section), Apple's <strong>Bonjour</strong> software will automatically ensure hostnames on the network are correctly registered. As stated previously, if you have a Mac OS X, you will have Bonjour running already. On Windows, you can either install iTunes, or you can install it separately (available from <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999">https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999</a>). By default, the hostname <strong>raspberrypi</strong> can be used.</p>
<p>We are now ready to test the new connection, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the network cable to Raspberry Pi and the computer's network port, and then power up Raspberry Pi, ensuring that you have re-inserted the SD card if you previously removed it. To reboot Raspberry Pi, if you edited the file there, use <kbd>sudo reboot</kbd> to restart it.</li>
<li>Allow a minute or two for Raspberry Pi to fully power up. We can now test the connection.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>From the connected laptop or computer, test the connection by pinging with the hostname of Raspberry Pi, as shown in the following command (on Linux or OS X, add <kbd>-c 4</kbd> to limit to four messages or press <span class="KeyPACKT">Ctrl</span> + <span class="KeyPACKT">C</span> to exit):</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>ping raspberrypi</strong>  </pre>
<p>Hopefully, you will find you have a working connection and receive replies from the<br/>
Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>If you have a keyboard and a screen connected to Raspberry Pi, you can perform the<br/>
following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can ping the computer in return (for example, <kbd>192.168.137.1</kbd>) from Raspberry Pi Terminal as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo ping 192.168.137.1 -c 4</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>You can test the link to the internet by using <kbd>ping</kbd> to connect to a well-known website as follows, assuming you do not access the internet through a proxy server:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo ping www.raspberrypi.org -c 4</strong>  </pre>
<p>If all goes well, you will have full internet available through your computer to Raspberry Pi, allowing you to browse the web as well as update and install new software.</p>
<p>If the connection fails, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Repeat the process, ensuring that the first three sets of numbers match with Raspberry Pi and the network adapter IP addresses.</li>
<li>You can also check that when Raspberry Pi powers up, the correct IP address is being set using the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>hostname -I</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Check your firewall settings to ensure your firewall is not blocking internal network connections.</li>
</ol>

<p>When we enable ICS on the primary computer, the operating system will automatically allocate a new IP address to the computer. Once connected and powered up, Raspberry Pi will set itself to a compatible IP address and use the primary computer IP address as an Internet Gateway.</p>
<p>By using Apple Bonjour, we are able to use <kbd>raspberrypi</kbd> hostname to connect to Raspberry Pi from the connected computer.</p>
<p>Finally, we check whether the computer can communicate over the direct network link to Raspberry Pi, back the other way, and also through to the internet.</p>

<p>If you do not require the internet on Raspberry Pi, or your computer has only a single network adapter, you can still connect the computers together through a direct network link. Refer to the following diagram:</p>

            <article>
                
<p>For a network link to work between two computers, they need to be using the same address range. The allowable address range is determined by the subnet mask (for example, <kbd>255.255.0.0</kbd> or <kbd>255.255.255.0</kbd> would mean all IP addresses should be the same except for the last two, or just the last number in the IP address; otherwise, they will be filtered).</p>
<p>To use a direct link without enabling ICS, check the IP settings of the adapter you are<br/>
going to connect to and determine whether it is automatically allocated or fixed to a<br/>
specific IP address.</p>
<p>Most PCs connected directly to another computer will allocate an IP address in the range <kbd>169.254.X.X</kbd> (with a subnet mask of <kbd>255.255.0.0</kbd>). However, we must ensure that the network adaptor is set to <span class="packt_screen">Obtain an IP address automatically</span>.</p>
<p>For Raspberry Pi to be able to communicate through the direct link, it needs to have an IP address in the same address range, <kbd>169.254.X.X</kbd>. As mentioned before, Raspberry Pi will automatically give itself a suitable IP address and connect to the network.</p>
<p>Therefore, assuming we have <span class="packt_screen">Apple Bonjour</span> (mentioned previously), we only need to know the hostname given to Raspberry Pi (<kbd>raspberrypi</kbd>).</p>

<p>You will need to obtain a suitable USB Wi-Fi dongle, and, in some cases, you may require a powered USB hub (this will depend on the hardware version of Raspberry Pi you have and the quality of your power supply). General suitability of USB Wi-Fi dongles will vary depending on the chipset that is used inside and the level of Linux support available. You may find that some USB Wi-Fi dongles will work without installing additional drivers (in which case you can jump to configuring it for the wireless network).</p>
<p>A list of supported Wi-Fi adapters is available at <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Wi-Fi_Adapters">http://elinux.org/RPi_USB_Wi-Fi_Adapters</a>.</p>
<p>You will need to ensure that your Wi-Fi adapter is also compatible with your intended network; for example, it supports the same types of signals <strong>802.11bgn</strong> and the encryptions <strong>WEP</strong>, <strong>WPA</strong>, and <strong>WPA2</strong> (although most networks are backward compatible).</p>
<p>You will also need the following details of your network:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Service set identifier (SSID)</strong>: This is the name of your Wi-Fi network and should be visible if you use the following command:</li>
</ul>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo iwlist scan | grep SSID</strong>  </pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption type and key</strong>: This value will be <span class="packt_screen">None</span>, <span class="packt_screen">WEP</span>, <span class="packt_screen">WPA</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">WPA2</span>, and the key will be the code you normally enter when you connect your phone or laptop to the wireless network (sometimes, it is printed on the router).</li>
</ul>
<p>You will require a working internet connection (that is, wired Ethernet) to download the required drivers. Otherwise, you may be able to locate the required firmware files (they will be the <kbd>.deb</kbd> files) and copy them to Raspberry Pi (that is, via a USB flash drive; the drive should be automatically mounted if you are running in desktop mode). Copy the file to a suitable location and install it, using the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo apt-get install firmware_file.deb</strong>  </pre>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>This task has two stages: first, we identify and install firmware for the Wi-Fi adapter, and then we need to configure it for the wireless network.</p>
<p>We will try to identify the chipset of your Wi-Fi adapter (the part that handles the connection); this may not match the actual manufacturer of the device.</p>
<p>An approximate list of supported firmware can be found with this command:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo apt-cache search wireless firmware</strong>  </pre>
<p>This will produce results similar to the following output (disregarding any results without <kbd>firmware</kbd> in the package title):</p>
<pre><strong>atmel-firmware - Firmware for Atmel at76c50x wireless networking chips.</strong>
<strong>firmware-atheros - Binary firmware for Atheros wireless cards</strong>
<strong>firmware-brcm80211 - Binary firmware for Broadcom 802.11 wireless cards</strong>
<strong>firmware-ipw2x00 - Binary firmware for Intel Pro Wireless 2100, 2200 and 2915</strong>
<strong>firmware-iwlwifi - Binary firmware for Intel PRO/Wireless 3945 and 802.11n cards</strong>
<strong>firmware-libertas - Binary firmware for Marvell Libertas 8xxx wireless cards</strong>
<strong>firmware-ralink - Binary firmware for Ralink wireless cards</strong>
<strong>firmware-realtek - Binary firmware for Realtek wired and wireless network adapters</strong>
<strong>libertas-firmware - Firmware for Marvell's libertas wireless chip series (dummy package)</strong>
<strong>zd1211-firmware - Firmware images for the zd1211rw wireless driver</strong>  </pre>
<p>To find out the chipset of your wireless adapter, plug the Wi-Fi-adapter into Raspberry Pi, and from the terminal, run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>dmesg | grep 'Product:|Manufacturer:'</strong></pre>
<div class="packt_infobox">This command stitches together two commands into one. First, <kbd>dmesg</kbd> displays the message buffer of the kernel (this is an internal record of system events that have occurred since power on, such as detected USB devices). You can try the command on its own to observe the complete output.<br/>
<br/>
The <kbd>|</kbd> (pipe) sends the output to the <kbd>grep</kbd> command; <kbd>grep 'Product:|Manufacturer'</kbd> checks it and only returns lines that contain <kbd>Product</kbd> or <kbd>Manufacturer</kbd> (so we should get a summary of any items that are listed as <kbd>Product</kbd> and <kbd>Manufacturer</kbd>). If you don't find anything or want to see all your USB devices, try the <kbd>grep 'usb'</kbd> command instead.</div>
<p>This should return something similar to the following output—in this case, I've got a <kbd>ZyXEL</kbd> device, which has a <kbd>ZyDAS</kbd> chipset (a quick Google search reveals that <kbd>zd1211-firmware</kbd> is for <kbd>ZyDAS</kbd> devices):</p>
<pre><strong>[    1.893367] usb usb1: Product: DWC OTG Controller</strong>
<strong>[    1.900217] usb usb1: Manufacturer: Linux 3.6.11+ dwc_otg_hcd</strong>
<strong>[    3.348259] usb 1-1.2: Product: ZyXEL G-202</strong>
<strong>[    3.355062] usb 1-1.2: Manufacturer: ZyDAS</strong>  </pre>
<p>Once you have identified your device and the correct firmware, you can install it as you would any other package available through <kbd>apt-get</kbd> (where <kbd>zd1211-firmware</kbd> can be replaced with your required firmware). This is shown in the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo apt-get install zd1211-firmware</strong>  </pre>
<p>Remove and reinsert the USB Wi-Fi dongle to allow it to be detected and the drivers loaded. We can now test whether the new adapter is correctly installed with <kbd>ifconfig</kbd>. The output is shown as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>wlan0     IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:off/any</strong>
<strong>          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=20 dBm</strong>
<strong>          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off</strong>
<strong>          Power Management:off</strong>  </pre>
<p>The command will show the network adapters present on the system. For Wi-Fi, this is usually <kbd>wlan0</kbd> or <kbd>wlan1</kbd> and so on if you have installed more than one. If not, double-check the selected firmware and perhaps try an alternative or check on the site for troubleshooting tips.</p>
<p>Once we have the firmware installed for the Wi-Fi adapter, we will need to configure it for the network we wish to connect to. We can use the GUI as shown in the previous recipe, or we can manually configure it through the Terminal, as shown in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>We will need to add the wireless adapter to the list of network interfaces, which is set in <kbd>/etc/network/interfaces</kbd>, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo nano -c /etc/network/interfaces </strong>  </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Using the previous <kbd>wlan#</kbd> value in place of <kbd>wlan0</kbd> if required, add the following command:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>allow-hotplug wlan0</strong>
<strong>iface wlan0 inet manual</strong>
<strong>wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</strong>  </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">When the changes have been made, save and exit by pressing <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Ctrl</span></em> + <em><span class="KeyPACKT">X</span></em>, <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Y</span></em>, and <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Enter</span></em>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>We will now store the Wi-Fi network settings of our network in the <kbd>wpa_supplicant.conf</kbd> file (don't worry if your network doesn't use the <kbd>wpa</kbd> encryption; it is just the default name for the file):</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo nano -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</strong>  </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">It should include the following:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">The network settings can be written within this file as follows (that is, if the SSID is set as <kbd>theSSID</kbd>):</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>You can enable the adapter with the following command (again, replace <kbd>wlan0</kbd> if required):</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo ifup wlan0</strong>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">If not, adjust your settings and use <kbd>sudo ifdown wlan0</kbd> to switch off the network interface, and then <kbd>sudo ifup wlan0</kbd> to switch it back on. This will confirm that you have successfully connected to your Wi-Fi network.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Finally, we will need to check whether we have access to the internet. Here, we have assumed that the network is automatically configured with DHCP and no proxy server is used. If not, refer to the <em>Connecting to the internet through a proxy server</em> recipe.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Unplug the wired network cable, if still connected, and see whether you can ping the Raspberry Pi website, as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong><strong>sudo ping </strong>www.raspberrypi.org</strong>  </pre>
<div class="packt_tip">If you want to quickly know the IP address currently in use by Raspberry Pi, you can use <kbd>hostname -I</kbd>, or to find out which adapter is connected to which IP address, use <kbd>ifconfig</kbd>.</div>

<p>The Model A version of Raspberry Pi does not have a built-in network port, so to get a network connection, a USB network adapter will have to be added (either a Wi-Fi dongle, as explained in the preceding section, or a LAN-to-USB adapter, as described in the following section).</p>

<p>Just like USB Wi-Fi, the adapter support will depend on the chipset used and the drivers available. Unless the device comes with Linux drivers, you may have to search the internet to obtain the suitable Debian Linux drivers.</p>
<p>If you find a suitable <kbd>.deb</kbd> file, you can install it with the following command:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo apt-get install firmware_file.deb</strong>  </pre>
<p>Also, check using <kbd>ifconfig</kbd>, as some devices will be supported automatically, appear as <kbd>eth1</kbd> (or <kbd>eth0</kbd> on Model A), and be ready for use immediately.</p>

<p>You should confirm that Raspberry Pi is already connected to the network and that you can access the proxy server.</p>
<p>Use the <kbd>ping</kbd> command to check this, as follows:</p>

<p>Often, it is preferable to remotely connect to and control Raspberry Pi across the network, for instance, using a laptop or desktop computer as a screen and keyboard, or while Raspberry Pi is connected elsewhere, perhaps even connected to some hardware it needs to be close to.</p>
<p>VNC is just one way in which you can remotely connect to Raspberry Pi. It will create a new desktop session that will be controlled and accessed remotely. The VNC session here is separate from the one that may be active on Raspberry Pi's display.</p>

<li>First, we need to install the TightVNC server on Raspberry Pi with the following commands. It is advisable to run an <kbd>update</kbd> command first to get the latest version of the package you want to install, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo apt-get update</strong>
<strong>sudo apt-get install tightvncserver</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Accept the prompt to install and wait until it completes. To start a session, use the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>vncserver :1</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>The first time you run this, it will ask you to enter a password (of no more than eight characters) to access the desktop (you will use this when you connect from your computer).</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The following message should confirm that a new desktop session has been started:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>New 'X' desktop is raspberrypi:1</strong>  </pre>
<p>If you do not already know the IP address of Raspberry Pi, use <kbd>hostname -I</kbd> and take note of it.</p>
<p>Next, we need to run a VNC client. <strong>VNC Viewer</strong> is suitable program, which is available at <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.realvnc.com/</span></a> and should work on Windows, Linux, and OS X.</p>
<p>When you run VNC Viewer, you will be prompted for the <span class="packt_screen">Server</span> address and <span class="packt_screen">Encryption</span> type. Use the IP address of your Raspberry Pi with <kbd>:1</kbd>. That is, for the IP address <kbd>192.168.1.69</kbd>, use the <kbd>192.168.1.69:1</kbd> address.</p>
<p>You can leave the <span class="packt_screen">Encryption type</span> as <span class="packt_screen">Off</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Automatic</span>.</p>
<p>Depending on your network, you may be able to use the hostname; the default is <kbd>raspberrypi</kbd>, that is <kbd>raspberrypi:1</kbd>.</p>
<p>You may have a warning about not having connected to the computer before or having no encryption. You should enable encryption if you are using a public network or if you are performing connections over the internet (to stop others from being able to intercept your data).</p>

<p>You can add options to the command line to specify the resolution and also the color depth of the display. The higher the resolution and color depth (can be adjusted to use 8-bits to 32-bits per pixel to provide low or high color detail), the more data has to be transferred through the network link. If you find the refresh rate a little slow, try reducing these numbers as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>vncserver :1 -geometry 1280x780 -depth 24</strong>  </pre>
<p>To allow the VNC server to start automatically when you switch on, you can add the <kbd>vncserver</kbd> command to <kbd>.bash_profile</kbd> (this is executed each time Raspberry Pi starts).</p>
<p>Use the <kbd>nano</kbd> editor as follows (the <kbd>-c</kbd> option allows the line numbers to be displayed):</p>
<pre><strong>sudo nano -c ~/.bash_profile</strong>  </pre>
<p>Add the following line to the end of the file:</p>
<pre><strong>vncserver :1</strong>  </pre>
<p>The next time you power up, you should be able to remotely connect using VNC from<br/>
another computer.</p>

<p>An <strong>Secure Shell</strong> (<strong>SSH</strong>) is often the preferred method for making remote connections, as it allows only the Terminal connections and typically requires fewer resources.</p>
<p>An extra feature of SSH is the ability to transfer the <strong>X11</strong> data to an <strong>X Windows</strong> server running on your machine. This allows you to start programs that would normally run on Raspberry Pi desktop, and they will appear in their own Windows on the local computer, as follows:</p>

<p>Linux and OS X have built-in support for X11 forwarding, but if you are using Windows, you will need to install and run the X Windows server on your computer.</p>
<p>Download and run <kbd>xming</kbd> from the <strong>Xming</strong> site (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/"><span class="URLPACKT">http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/</span></a>).</p>
<p>Install <kbd>xming</kbd>, following the installation steps, including the installation of <strong>PuTTY</strong> if you don't have it already. You can also download PuTTY separately from <a href="http://www.putty.org/"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.putty.org/</span></a>.</p>
<p>Next, we need to ensure that the SSH program we use has X11 enabled when we connect.</p>
<p>For Windows, we shall use PuTTY to connect to Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>In the <span class="packt_screen">PuTTY Configuration</span> dialog box, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Connection</span> | <span class="packt_screen">SSH</span> | <span class="packt_screen">X11</span> and tick the checkbox for <span class="packt_screen">Enable</span> <span class="packt_screen">X11 forwarding</span>. If you leave the <span class="packt_screen">X display location</span> option blank, it will assume the default <kbd>Server 0:0</kbd> as follows (you can confirm the server number by moving your mouse over the Xming icon in the system tray when it is running):</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/0ded537c-c55b-4e78-8baa-30c73a321b3f.jpg" style="width:28.17em;height:25.00em;" width="618" height="549"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Enabling X11 forwarding within the PuTTY configuration</div>
<p>Enter the IP address of Raspberry Pi in the <span class="packt_screen">Session</span> settings (you may also find that you can use Raspberry Pi's hostname here instead; the default hostname is <kbd>raspberrypi</kbd>).</p>
<p>Save the setting using a suitable name, <kbd>RaspberryPi</kbd>, and click on <span class="packt_screen">Open</span> to connect to your Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>You are likely to see a warning message pop up stating you haven't connected to the computer before (this allows you to check whether you have everything right before continuing):</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="Images/1d7048eb-d422-48a9-b276-4d6cf6c03eb5.jpg" style="width:32.25em;height:28.67em;" width="618" height="549"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Opening an SSH connection to Raspberry Pi using PuTTY</div>
<p>For OS X or Linux, click on <span class="packt_screen">Terminal</span> to open a connection to Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>To connect with the default <kbd>pi</kbd> username, with an IP address of <kbd>192.168.1.69</kbd>, use the following command; the <kbd>-X</kbd> option enables X11 forwarding:</p>
<pre><strong>ssh -X pi@192.168.1.69</strong>  </pre>
<p>All being well, you should be greeted with a prompt for your password (remember the default value for the <kbd>pi</kbd> user is <kbd>raspberry</kbd>).</p>
<p>Ensure that you have Xming running by starting the Xming program from your computer's Start menu. Then, in the Terminal window, type a program that normally runs within Raspberry Pi desktop, such as <kbd>leafpad</kbd> or <kbd>scratch</kbd>. Wait a little while and the program should appear on your computer's desktop (if you get an error, you have probably forgotten to start Xming, so run it and try again).</p>

<p>X Windows and X11 is what provides the method by which Raspberry Pi (and many other Linux-based computers) can display and control graphical Windows as part of a desktop.</p>
<p>For X11 forwarding to work over a network connection, we need both SSH and X11 forwarding enabled on Raspberry Pi. Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>To switch on (or off) SSH, you can access <span class="packt_screen">Raspberry Pi Configuration</span><br/>
program under the <span class="packt_screen">Preferences</span> menu on the <span class="packt_screen">Desktop</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">SSH</span> within the <span class="packt_screen">Interfaces</span> tab, as shown in the following screenshot (SSH is often enabled by default for most distributions to help allow remote connections without needing a monitor to configure it):</li>

</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Look for a line in the <kbd>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</kbd> file that controls X11 forwarding and ensure that it says <kbd>yes</kbd> (with no <kbd>#</kbd> sign before it), as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>X11Forwarding yes</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Save if required by pressing <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Ctrl</span></em> + <em><span class="KeyPACKT">X</span></em>, <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Y</span></em>, and <em><span class="KeyPACKT">Enter</span></em> and reboot (if you need to change it) as follows:</li>

<p>You can even run a complete desktop session through X11, although it isn't particularly<br/>
user friendly and VNC will produce better results. To achieve this, you have to use <kbd>lxsession</kbd> instead of <kbd>startx</kbd> (in the way you would normally start the desktop from the Terminal).</p>
<p>An alternative is to use <kbd>lxpanel</kbd>, which provides the program menu bar from which you can start and run programs from the menu as you would on the desktop.</p>

<p>First, we need to install <kbd>samba</kbd>, a piece of software that handles folder sharing in a format that is compatible with Windows sharing methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you use <kbd>update</kbd> as follows to obtain the latest list of available packages:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo apt-get update</strong>
<strong>sudo apt-get install samba</strong>  </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The install will require around 20 MB of space and take a few minutes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once the installation has completed, we can make a copy of the configuration file as follows to allow us to restore defaults if needed:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.backup</strong>
<strong>sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf</strong>  </pre>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">As described in the file, this setting ensures that you have to enter your username and password for Raspberry Pi in order to access the files (this is important for shared networks).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Find the section called <kbd>Share Definitions</kbd> and <kbd>[homes]</kbd>, and change the <kbd>read only = yes</kbd> line to <kbd>read only = no</kbd>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This will allow us to view and also write files to the shared home folder.

</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo pdbedit -a -u pi</strong></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now, enter a password (you can use the same password as your login or select a different one, but avoid using the default Raspberry password, which would be very easy for someone to guess). Restart <kbd>samba</kbd> to use the new configuration file, as follows:</li>

<p>The Linux image used by Raspberry Pi is often updated to include enhancements, fixes, and improvements to the system, as well as adding support for new hardware or changes made to the latest board. Many of the packages that you install can be updated too.</p>
<p>This is particularly important if you plan on using the same system image on another Raspberry Pi board (particularly a newer one), as older images will lack support for any wiring changes or alternative RAM chips. New firmware should work on older Raspberry Pi boards, but older firmware may not be compatible with the latest hardware.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you need not reflash your SD card every time there is a new release, since you can update it instead.</p>

<p>You will need to be connected to the internet to update your system. It is always advisable to make a backup of your image first (and at a minimum, make a copy of your important files).</p>
<p>You can check your current version of firmware with the <kbd>uname -a</kbd> command, as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>Linux raspberrypi 4.4.9-v7+ #884 SMP Fri May 6 17:28:59 BST 2016 armv7l GNU/Linux</strong>  </pre>
<p>The GPU firmware can be checked using the <kbd>/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd version</kbd> command, as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>   May  6 2016 13:53:23</strong>
<strong>Copyright (c) 2012 Broadcom</strong>
<strong>version 0cc642d53eab041e67c8c373d989fef5847448f8 (clean) (release)</strong></pre>
<p>This is important if you are using an older version of firmware (pre-November 2012) on a newer board, since the original Model B board was only 254 MB RAM. Upgrading allows the firmware to make use of the extra memory if available.</p>
<p>The <kbd>free -h</kbd> command will detail the RAM available to the main processor (the total RAM is split between the GPU and ARM cores) and will give the following output:</p>

<li>Before running any upgrades or installing any packages, it is worth ensuring you have the latest list of packages in the repository. The <kbd>update</kbd> command gets the latest list of available software and versions:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo apt-get update</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>If you just want to obtain an upgrade of your current packages, <kbd>upgrade</kbd> will bring them all up to date:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo apt-get upgrade</strong></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>To ensure that you are running the latest release of Raspbian, you can run <kbd>dist-upgrade</kbd> (be warned: this can take an hour or so depending on the amount that needs to be upgraded). This will perform all the updates that <kbd>upgrade</kbd> will perform but will also remove redundant packages and clean up:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</strong>  </pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Both methods will upgrade the software, including the firmware used at boot and startup (<kbd>bootcode.bin</kbd> and <kbd>start.elf</kbd>).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>To update the firmware, the following command can be used:</li>

<p>You will often find that you will want to perform a clean installation of your setup, however, this will mean you will have to install everything from scratch. To avoid this, I developed the Pi-Kitchen project (<a href="https://github.com/PiHw/Pi-Kitchen">https://github.com/PiHw/Pi-Kitchen</a>), based on the groundwork of <em>Kevin Hill</em>. This aims to provide a flexible platform for creating customized setups that can be automatically deployed to an SD card:</p>

<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Pi Kitchen allows Raspberry Pi to be configured before powering up</div>
<p>The Pi-Kitchen allows a range of flavors to be configured, which can be selected from the NOOBS menu. Each flavor consists of a list of recipes, each providing a specific function or feature to the final operating system. Recipes can range from setting up custom drivers for Wi-Fi devices, to mapping shared drives on your network, to providing a fully functional web server out of the box, all combining to make your required setup.</p>
<p>This project is in beta, developed as a proof of concept, but once you have everything configured, it can be incredibly useful to deploy fully working setups directly onto an SD card. Ultimately, the project could be combined with Kevin Hill's advanced version of NOOBS, called <strong>PINN Is Not NOOBS</strong> (<strong><span>PINN</span></strong>), which aims to allow extra features for advanced users, such as allowing operating systems and configurations to be stored on your network or on an external USB memory stick.</p>

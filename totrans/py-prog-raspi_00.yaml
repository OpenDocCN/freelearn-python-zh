- en: The Raspberry Pi represents the best in innovation in computer science, education,
    entertainment, hobby hacking, and several other categories that you can classify
    the device family into. Even as this book is entering publication, the Raspberry
    Pi family of products have become the third best selling computers of all time.
    It is anyone’s guess that with the continuing innovation coming out of the Raspberry
    Pi Foundation and the thousands of people across the planet constantly demonstrating
    newer and better examples innovative solutions with the various flavors of Raspberry
    Pi, what new heights this product line might reach!

- en: One of the main goals of the Raspberry Pi is affordability. And the purpose
    of this book is to allow the beginner to learn Programming in Python, as well
    as manipulating hardware. The reader may have worked a little bit on hardware,
    and a little bit on programming, and want to strengthen skills in either area.
    The reader may also just be interested in doing more projects with the Pi Zero
    in Python, and of course, some of the projects in this book, briefly highlighted
    below might be of interest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book starts off with some warm up examples, helping develop a familiarity
    with the Raspberry Pi environment, and the projects increase in variety and complexity
    as the book progresses. While, readers who have advanced a bit before approaching
    the book can skip a few chapters, we recommend beginners progress through all
    chapters, since the concepts build on top of each other.

    covers all the communication interfaces available on the Raspberry Pi Zero. This
    includes the I2C, UART, and the SPI interface. These communication interfaces
    are widely used to interface sensors. Hence, we will demonstrate the operation
    of each interface using a sensor as an example.'

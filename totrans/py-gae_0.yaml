- en: In April 2008, 10,000 developers from all around the world were lucky enough
    to get an account to access the preview release of Google App Engine, which is
    a tool designed to let users run their web applications on the same infrastructure
    Google uses for its own services. Announced during Google's Campfire One event,
    App Engine was described as something easy to use, easy to scale and free to get
    started; three design goals that perfectly matched the requirements of a typical
    tech start-up trying to reduce the time to market.

- en: While other big companies at that time were already offering to lease part of
    their own infrastructure, selling reliability and scalability in an affordable,
    pay-per-use fashion, Google set App Engine one step ahead by providing developers
    with application-building blocks instead of simple access to hardware; it is a
    hosting model followed by many others later on. The goal of this model is to let
    developers focus on the code and forget about failing machines, network issues,
    scalability problems, and performance tuning; the choice of Python as the first
    programming language supported by App Engine was a natural choice for a tool whose
    aim is to make writing and running web applications easier.

- en: During the Google I/O event in 2012, Google announced that several other building
    blocks from its own infrastructure would be made available under the name of Google
    Cloud Platform, first as a partner program and then as a general availability
    product. Currently, App Engine is not only a notable member of the Cloud Platform
    family but also a mature and well-maintained platform, widely adopted and with
    a huge list of customers' success stories.

    App Engine, getting the most out of Google Cloud Platform. Starting with a simple
    application, you will add more and more features to it, each time with the help
    of the components and services provided by Google's infrastructure.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started"), *Getting Started*, will
    help you get your hands dirty with a very simple functional Python application
    running on a production server. The chapter begins with making a survey of Google''s
    cloud infrastructure, showing where App Engine is placed and how it compares to
    other well-known cloud services. It then walks readers through downloading and
    installing the runtime for Linux, Windows, and OS X, coding a `Hello, World!`
    application and deploying it on App Engine. The last part introduces administration
    consoles both for the development and production servers.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. A More Complex Application"), *A More Complex
    Application*, teaches you how to implement a complex web application running on
    App Engine. It begins with an introduction to the bundled webapp2 framework and
    possible alternatives; then, you will get in touch with user authentication and
    form handling and then an introduction to Google''s Datastore nonrelational database.
    The last part shows you how to make HTML pages through templates rendering and
    how to serve all the static files needed to style the page.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Storing and Processing Users'' Data"), *Storing
    and Processing Users'' Data*, will show you how to add more functionalities to
    the app from the previous chapter. The chapter begins by showing you how to let
    users upload files using Google Cloud Storage and how to manipulate such files
    when they contain image data with the Image API. It then introduces you to the
    task queues used to execute long jobs (such as image manipulation) outside the
    request process and how to schedule batches of such jobs. The last part shows
    you how to send and receive e-mails through the Mail API.'

    Application Performance*, begins by showing how to improve application performance
    using advanced features of Datastore. It then shows you how to use the cache provided
    by App Engine and how to break the application into smaller services using Modules.'

    Data in Google Cloud SQL*, is dedicated to the Google Cloud SQL service. It shows
    you how to create and manage a database instance and how to connect and perform
    queries. It then demonstrates how an App Engine application can save and retrieve
    data and how to use a local MySQL installation during development.'

    *Using Channels to Implement a Real-time Application*, shows you how to make our
    application real time, in other words, how to update what clients see without
    reloading the page in the browser. The first part shows how the Channel API works,
    what happens when a client connects, and what roundtrip of a message is from the
    server to the client. Then, it shows you how to add a real-time feature to our
    application from previous chapters.'

    an Application with Django*, teaches you how to build an App Engine application
    using the Django web framework instead of webapp2\. The first part shows you how
    to configure the local environment for development, and then the application from
    previous chapters is rewritten using some of the features provided by Django.
    The last part shows you how to deploy the application on a production server.'

    *Exposing a REST API with Google Cloud Endpoints*, shows you how to rewrite part
    of our application to expose data through a REST API. The first part explores
    all the operations needed to set up and configure a project and how to implement
    a couple of endpoints for our API. The last part shows explores how to add OAuth
    protection to the API endpoints.'

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-312" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor666" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>Going Further – What To Do Next</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">You have now finished the book—congratulations! Learning ROS 2 is quite a challenge, and you’ve made a <span>big step.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">To recap, this is what <span>you learned:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><em class="italic">Part 1:</em> You cleared up some misconceptions, installed ROS 2, and discovered some of the main concepts through experimentation. This set you up for the rest of <span>the book.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><em class="italic">Part 2:</em> This is where you learned about the most important ROS 2 concepts: how to write nodes and communicate with topics, services, and actions, and also how to make your application more dynamic with parameters and <span>launch files.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><em class="italic">Part 3:</em> You built a simulated robot, and while practicing the core concepts, you learned about TF, URDF, and Gazebo. TFs are the backbone of almost every ROS <span>2 application.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">With this, you have a solid foundation you can use for any other ROS 2 project. Now, I don’t want to leave you there and just say that’s it. ROS 2 contains a lot more things, and robotics in general is much broader than just ROS 2. Thus, to help you have a better idea for the future, in this last small chapter, I will give you some recommendations on what to <span>do next.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">What to do next is not the same for everyone. I will first attempt to provide a general roadmap, and then explore different nuances and details that will help you choose what to learn, depending on what you want to do. I will also share some extra resources that you can use to learn more about <span>ROS 2.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">By the end of this chapter, you will have a better idea of what to do next, depending on your project, job, or <span>learning objectives.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will cover the <span>following topics:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10">ROS 2 roadmap – <span>exploration phase</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Learning for a <span>specific goal</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-313" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor667" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>ROS 2 roadmap – exploration phase</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">When learning a <a id="_idIndexMarker907" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>technological topic, I would say the usual pattern is <span>as follows:</span></p>
			<ol class="calibre11">
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Discovery phase</strong>: You start <a id="_idIndexMarker908" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>with the basics that <a id="_idIndexMarker909" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>everybody should learn, get a broad understanding of the technology, and learn how to <span>use it.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Exploration phase</strong>: Once <a id="_idIndexMarker910" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>you have the basics, you try <a id="_idIndexMarker911" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>to explore different applications, projects, and topics related to the technology. This will make you connect lots of dots and will give you an even better understanding of the global picture. You will also become <span>better technically.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Specialization phase</strong>: It’s impossible to be an expert on everything. At some point, to be <a id="_idIndexMarker912" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>able to dive deep into a project, to get <a id="_idIndexMarker913" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>a job, or to build a career, you will need to specialize in one particular field. After exploring lots of topics, you will have a better idea of what you want to do, or what’s most in demand. You can then focus your attention <span>and specialize.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="calibre3">With this book, you have covered the first step. You have learned the basics that you absolutely need and will, for sure, use in almost all your <span>future projects.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">What we will cover now is the exploration phase, which comes right after that. In this section, I will attempt to provide you with a ROS 2 roadmap. This roadmap is a (non-exhaustive) list of what you can learn next, in no <span>particular order.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Before we get started, note that I don’t recommend following the roadmap exactly as it is. The best way to learn is through projects. So, in this section, we have a skill list, and in the next section, we will explore different project/job examples to see how to pick the skills you need <span>to learn.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Also, this is my own version; not every ROS expert would necessarily agree with me. If you find something that works for you, that’s completely fine. The goal here is to <span>make progress.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">I didn’t include links for this section because a simple Google search with the provided keywords will do. You will mostly find resources in the official documentation, independent tutorials and YouTube videos, GitHub projects, and questions asked <span>in f<a id="_idTextAnchor668" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>orums.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-314" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor669" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>Common stacks and frameworks</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">After learning <a id="_idIndexMarker914" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>the core programming basics and concepts, such as TF and URDF, a very common next step is to learn about some of the existing ROS 2 <strong class="bold">stacks</strong> and <strong class="bold">frameworks</strong>, and also <a id="_idIndexMarker915" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>learn how to create interfaces between ROS 2 and <span>hardware components.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You will often see the terms <em class="italic">stack</em>, <em class="italic">framework</em>, and other variations. They usually mean the same thing. Basically, they are collections of packages that focus on solving a <span>specific problem.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Among those stacks/frameworks, you can find <strong class="bold">Navigation 2</strong> (for <strong class="bold">mobile robots</strong>), <strong class="bold">MoveIt 2</strong> (for <strong class="bold">robotic arms</strong> and grippers), and <strong class="bold">ros2_control</strong> (for <span><strong class="bold">hardware control</strong></span><span>).</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">We will be talking about them because they are used in a lot of applications, and knowing about them is very likely to be beneficial for you. Let’s start with the <span>hardware in<a id="_idTextAnchor670" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>terface.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">Hardware interface (and ros2_control)</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">In the end, a robotics developer creates software in order to control pieces of hardware. You make <a id="_idIndexMarker916" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>motors move, you read data from sensors, and you add some algorithms in the middle to create a robotics system that does <span>something useful.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The hardware interfacing part is crucial, and unless you only work with simulation, you will have to work with hardware. Thus, I recommend that you get more familiar with how to write a hardware driver (not specifically related to ROS) and how to interface this hardware driver with <span>ROS 2.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">You can first try to create your own driver for a simple piece of hardware (anything: a motor, camera, or any other sensor). Once you can control your hardware with Python or C++, include your driver inside a ROS 2 node, and add topics/services/parameters to create a bridge between the driver and <span>ROS 2.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">You can also find existing hardware components that have a ROS 2 driver, and have a look at their interface and code (often available <span>on GitHub).</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Understanding how to interact with hardware is a big step in your ROS <span>2 learning.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Then, once you get that, there is a great framework that allows you to make robust interfaces <a id="_idIndexMarker917" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>between your ROS 2 application and your hardware drivers. It’s called ros2_control. This framework is used in most robots powered by ROS 2. Once you understand how it works, you can set up new robots with hardware connections <span>very fast.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Warning: learning ros2_control is not easy, and the documentation is not what I would call beginner friendly. It also requires you to write code in C++ and to know more about advanced ROS 2 concepts such as lifecycle nodes and components. I don’t recommend you to learn ros2_control directly after this book, especially if that was the beginning of your ROS <span>2 journey.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">What I recommend is that you first get more comfortable with creating basic hardware interfaces for ROS 2. Then, as you progress throughout your projects, you will learn more about advanced ROS 2 concepts, and you will get to the point where you can <span>tackle ros<a id="_idTextAnchor671" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>2_control.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">Navigation 2 stack</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">The <strong class="bold">Navigation 2</strong> stack, also <a id="_idIndexMarker918" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>known as <strong class="bold">Nav2</strong>, is very popular for a reason: most robots using ROS 2 are mobile robots, and what do you usually do with a mobile robot? You make it navigate autonomously in a <span>physical environment.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now, with the ROS 2 basics you got from this book, how do you make that happen? There is a big gap between writing nodes and URDFs and making a robot navigate using path-planning algorithms. If you were to implement this by yourself, it would take you a lot of time <span>and effort.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">And if you remember, in the introduction of this book, we talked about how most of the time spent on robotics used to be about reinventing the wheel. We don’t want to <span>do that.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Fortunately, you can use the Nav2 stack. With this stack, you can easily create a map of the <a id="_idIndexMarker919" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>environment with <strong class="bold">Simultaneous Localization And Mapping</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAM</strong>), and then use this map to make your robot navigate from one place to another, while <span>avoiding obstacles.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Of course, the Nav2 stack comes with its own challenges but, once you understand it, you can set up a new autonomous mobile robot in no time, and you can easily work with the hundreds of existing robotics projects using <span>this stack.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">So, I strongly recommend you learn a bit about Nav2. Even if you don’t plan to work with mobile robots, you can get a basic understanding in just a few hours. Going deeper and actually adapting a robot for Nav2 will take longer, but for now, just get<a id="_idTextAnchor672" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/> <span>the basics.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">MoveIt 2</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">So, there is <a id="_idIndexMarker920" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>a stack for mobile robots, and guess what? There is also a stack for <span>robotic arms.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The two most common robots you will encounter in ROS 2 projects and jobs are mobile robots and robotic arms. Then come drones, but those are more niche and less supported. It doesn’t mean that you can’t find good packages to help you with drones, but it will for sure be more challenging. Then, even more niche (and less supported), you can find boats, spider robots, submarines, and <span>so on.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">If you are working with a robotic arm (let’s say with 5, 6, or 7 axes), you will need to find a way to compute positions and trajectories for this arm. How do you make the arm reach a certain point with a defined orientation, or pick up an object and place it <span>somewhere else?</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">This can become quite a challenge, especially when you learn more about inverse kinematics, motion planning, and when you try to make all the joints of the robot move and arrive at the same time, without colliding with anything, while having continuous positions, velocities, <span>and accelerations.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3"><strong class="bold">MoveIt 2</strong> will do the motion planning for you, for a robotic arm, or even a system with several robotic arms. It also has functionalities <span>for grasping.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">You will need to do some configuration for your robot (starting from the URDF), and then you can use some Python or C++ APIs directly in your nodes to send commands to control <span>the robot.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">I recommend <a id="_idIndexMarker921" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>you get at least a basic introduction to MoveIt 2, even if you won’t use robotic arms. You can set up a basic project in a few hours and see the <span>main functionalities.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">With Nav2 and MoveIt 2, you can cover a lot of ground. I don’t know the exact percentage of robots that use either of those stacks, but it’s definitely more than half of all ROS 2 robots. Nav2 and MoveIt 2 also both have integrations with ros2_control, which you can explore when you learn more <span>about ros2_control.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s now explore more topics rel<a id="_idTextAnchor673" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>ated to <span>ROS 2.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-315" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor674" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>More exploration topics</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">On top of common stacks and frameworks, there are many additional things you could learn <a id="_idIndexMarker922" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>or improve. Here, we will explore some of them, starting with the basics. As stated in this section’s introduction, for any topic, type the relevant keyword into Google—maybe followed by <strong class="source-inline1">tutorial</strong>—and you will find what you need (as explained in previous chapters, for more advanced ROS 2 concepts, documentation might be much more scarce). Once again, there is no particular order you should follow for this list of skills. Later in this chapter, we will see, with a few project and job examples, what to learn, depending<a id="_idTextAnchor675" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/> on <span>your goals.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">Coming back to the basics</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Before jumping to advanced ROS 2 concepts, you should make sure that you have the basics right. Maybe <a id="_idIndexMarker923" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>when reading this book and doing the exercises, using all the terminal commands was a challenge for you. Or maybe the Python code was OK, but writing with OOP is not something you are <span>used to.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">To give you an example, in my courses or workshops, I often see people struggling with typing the right command in the terminal using auto-completion. This is a basic skill that will make you work five times faster with Linux, but if you don’t know how to do it properly, your whole ROS 2 learning experience will be slowed down so much. You can’t overlook <span>the basics.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">At this point, it could be beneficial to improve your skills in <span>the following:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Linux</strong>: Especially the <a id="_idIndexMarker924" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>command line, and learning more about the environment. Understanding what the <strong class="source-inline">.bashrc</strong> does, navigating to a package installation folder, getting remote access with SSH: these are all examples of what you need to know in order not to be stuck in the future. You don’t need to be a Linux expert, but spending a few hours to improve the basics <span>can’t hurt.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Python</strong>: I guess at <a id="_idIndexMarker925" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>this point you should be quite comfortable with Python, but if you had some challenges because of Python (and not ROS 2), then it could be helpful to review some basics, especially with classes <span>and OOP.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">C++</strong>: If you only <a id="_idIndexMarker926" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>looked at the Python examples, now is a good time to try to do the same with C++. Not only will it make you review the concepts one more time, but as you progress with ROS 2, you will realize that a lot of code is only written in C++, especially for hardware control and algorithms that require a lot of computation power. If you want to become a great robotics developer, you will <span>need C++.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">Now, once you get those basics right, what other core ROS 2 concep<a id="_idTextAnchor676" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>ts could <span>you learn?</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">More advanced ROS 2 concepts</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Once you <a id="_idIndexMarker927" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>are comfortable with the prerequisites and the concepts from this book, you can go further and learn more advanced ROS 2 concepts, such as <span>the following:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Actions</strong>: We saw actions in <a href="B22403_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor338" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a>, but I clearly stated that this is a more advanced concept that was maybe worth skipping at the time if you felt overwhelmed. If you haven’t worked on actions yet, now is a good time. Actions, along with topics and services, will allow you to use all the ROS 2 communication mechanisms <span>between nodes.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Lifecycle nodes (also called managed nodes)</strong>: These nodes contain a state machine that allows you to easily separate your code for different parts of initialization and activation. This is especially useful when dealing with hardware. For example, you can make sure that a hardware component is correctly <a id="_idIndexMarker928" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>connected and initialized before using it in a critical part of your application. Also, lifecycle nodes will be useful if you want to <span>learn ros2_control.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Executors</strong>: With executors, you can have more control over how callbacks are handled within a node or several nodes (we saw an example in the <em class="italic">Adding the cancel mechanism</em> section of <a href="B22403_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor338" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"><span><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></span></a><span>).</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Components</strong>: By making your nodes components, you can run several nodes from within one executable. This can reduce resource usage and speed up communication. To learn about components, you first need to understand executors. Then, components will also help you <span>understand ros2_control.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">This is not a final list, but I would say that almost every ROS developer will need those concepts at <span>some point.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">On top of that, there are many additional technologies not related to ROS <a id="_idTextAnchor677" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>that can <span>be helpful.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">Extra technologies and fields</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">As we will see later in this chapter when we look at some job examples, being a ROS or robotics <a id="_idIndexMarker929" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>developer doesn’t mean you only need to learn about ROS. There are many more things required to have a complete <span>skill set.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are more technologies, fields, and tools that you can explore (I repeat, this is a non-exhaustive list, just some examples, and in no <span>particular order):</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Electronics/hardware</strong>: There is a huge part of hardware in robotics. In the end, you write code to move the hardware. Without the hardware, there is nothing. This <a id="_idIndexMarker930" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>is a complete field in itself. You could learn more about hardware platforms, communication protocols, soldering components, designing a <strong class="bold">printed circuit board</strong> (<strong class="bold">PCB</strong>), and so on. Some people make a career just out of this (hardware engineers). Even if you don’t plan to follow that road, it can be helpful to know a bit <span>about it.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Mechanics, CAD software, 3D design</strong>: Just like for hardware, some people make a career out of mechanical engineering. Without going too deep, it could be useful to learn about how to design a mechanical part using <span>CAD software.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Fast prototyping</strong>: This combines a lot of fields, and the goal is, as its name suggests, to <a id="_idIndexMarker931" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>create a prototype fast to validate (or not) an idea. For fast prototyping, you could use 3D printing and embedded hardware boards such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi (you can run ROS 2 on <span>Raspberry Pi).</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Git, continuous integration/deployment</strong>: The chances are that you will work with other people. These tools will help you collaborate and release code <span>more easily.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Docker</strong>: The use of Docker amongst robotics developers has been rising, as you can easily set up a new environment with the correct Ubuntu/ROS 2 version. This can be extremely useful for working on several projects and testing your code in <span>different environments.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">DDS, networking</strong>: ROS 2 <a id="_idIndexMarker932" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>communication relies on <strong class="bold">Data Distribution Service</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDS</strong>) and, depending on your project, you might have to dive a bit deeper into this, as well as networking <span>in general.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Image processing, machine learning, and so on</strong>: There is a huge field in robotics dedicated to analyzing the environment and extracting useful information from it. You can find a lot of ROS 2 integration with cameras, laser scanning, depth sensors, and also libraries such <span>as OpenCV.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">As you can see, that’s a lot of things. When seeing this list, you might feel a bit discouraged because you realize how little you know, even after finishing a whole book about ROS 2. Don’t worry, though; you don’t need to learn everything. I am personally not an expert in all those fields, and nobody is. We will now see how to learn ROS 2 more efficiently by having<a id="_idTextAnchor678" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/> a specific goal <span>in mind.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-316" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor679" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>Learning for a specific goal</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">The previous list of frameworks, stacks, and technologies can help you see the global picture of robotics, and help you pick what you need to <span>learn next.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">But, in the end, depending on your goals, your learning path may differ. If you’re a student looking to finish a university project with a mobile robot, or if you need to get up to speed to work for a robotics start-up creating simulation products, the answer is going to <span>be different.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">In this section, we will explore a few examples of projects and job offers, and see what learning path is more appropriate for each example. Note that the examples we will see do not make an exhaustive list of paths. Your own path is going to be unique. The real point of this section is to show you that you should first think about what you want to do with ROS 2, and from this, pick what <span>to learn.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Don’t stress too much about it: even if you choose a path and change later, no worries. You don’t need to have a definitive answer now about the kind of project or career you want to pursue. Remember, you are still in the exploration phase. Exploring means going one way, and then maybe realizing that you prefer another way, until you find something that really sticks with you. All the knowledge you gain while exploring will <span>be<a id="_idTextAnchor680" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/> valuable.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s <span>dive in.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-317" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor681" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>What to learn for a project?</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">The overall <a id="_idIndexMarker933" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>best way is to find a project and learn as you go. While building the project, you will encounter some challenges. Solving those challenges often means learning new things and they will force you to develop a better <span>practical understanding.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now, where to find projects? There are tons of project ideas on the internet. Depending on your hardware and financial resources, you might start with something that involves only a simulation, or if you have some hardware, you could build a robot or part of a robot yourself, and make the robot perform<a id="_idTextAnchor682" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/> a task in the <span>real world.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">A few project examples</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Let’s consider <a id="_idIndexMarker934" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>a few projects and the learning paths <span>they involve:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Using a mobile robot to find books in a library (typical university project)</strong>: Here, you will need to make a robot navigate, so you probably have to learn about the Nav2 stack in order to map the library and make the robot move in it. On top of that, you will need to figure out how to find books, maybe with a camera. You will choose and test a camera and integrate it with your robot. This will make you practice with hardware interfacing with the robot. Then, to recognize books, you will use image processing. Also, you can start by using an existing mobile platform, and then design <span>your own.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Warehouse management with mobile robots</strong>: With this project, you will also need to make robots navigate, but this time you will have to make several robots work in the same environment in an organized way. You can learn about controlling robot swarms, which is yet another thing to learn that we haven’t <span>listed previously.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Maintenance patrol with a drone</strong>: In this case, precise hardware control and remote communication will be the first challenge. Then, you will have to control the behavior of the drone. Drones are a specific kind of robot, and the MoveIt 2 or Nav2 stacks won’t apply; you will need to find something else. At the time of writing, unfortunately, there is no plug-and-play stack you can use for drones in ROS 2. So, you will need to do some extra research <span>and effort.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Sorting objects in a production line</strong>: Here, we reach a completely different domain, which is the manipulation of objects. If not provided, you will need to find which robotic arm (or other device) you can use to pick and place objects, what prehension system to use, and so on. Then, you can control the robot with MoveIt 2. After that, you also need to find a way to sort products. Maybe you need a camera; in this case, you will have to correctly place the camera, do some calibration, and coordinate the whole system so that the robot knows which objects to pick, <span>and where.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">These are a few examples, but you can see that depending on what kind of robots you will use, and what you want to do with those robots, the application will be completely different, which leads to<a id="_idTextAnchor683" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/> a different <span>learning path.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">My personal learning path</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">To give you yet another example, here is my personal story with ROS. I discovered ROS when I co-founded a robotics startup. We wanted to create an educational 6-axis robotic arm, and I was dealing with <span>the software.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Here is, more or less, my learning path with ROS: I started with the basics, then quickly went on <a id="_idIndexMarker935" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>to create a simplified URDF for the robot, and make it move with MoveIt, so we could see it move in RViz (we didn’t have a Gazebo simulation yet, but as we were building a real physical robot, we focused on the physical <span>control first).</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Then, the big challenge was to find reliable low-cost components and motors to control each of the 6 axes, create a hardware driver for each, and control them from an integrated Raspberry Pi board. This involved learning about communication protocols (and ros_control), working closely with the hardware, and experimenting <span>a lot.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">On another level, the goal was to create an intuitive user interface, so we developed some APIs on top of ROS, and a graphical interface with Angular. That alone required other kinds <span>of skills.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">The story is of course overly simplified, but as you can see, after getting the basics, I learned what I needed, when I needed it, so I could make progress on the project. For example, I didn’t learn about Gazebo or the Navigation stack first; this came much later. The reason is simply because that was not the most important<a id="_idTextAnchor684" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/> thing to learn at <span>the time.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-318" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor685" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>What to learn to get a job?</h2>
			<p class="calibre3">You might <a id="_idIndexMarker936" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>wonder: working on projects is nice, but if your goal is to get a job and start a career in robotics, what should <span>you learn?</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Again, the answer is: it depends. However, you could have a look at job offers you find on the internet and see more or less what is required for the kind of job that you want <span>to pursue.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Also, for a junior position, it is often not expected that you are an expert in any particular field. Companies know that you have just begun, and that you still need to learn. Thus, for junior positions or internships, a strong motivation to learn (bonus point: portfolio to showcase personal projects) is often more important than having skills in x, y, <span>or z.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Now, to give you some real examples, I found some existing job offers, and I will show you some of the technical requirements they ask for. To be clear: I won’t promote any company <a id="_idIndexMarker937" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>or job offer here, I will just put a recap of technical skills they require (that I have rewritten for brevity), for example <span>purposes only.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">Job 1 – ROS 2 development internship</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are <a id="_idIndexMarker938" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>the requirements for an internship centered <a id="_idIndexMarker939" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>around ROS <span>2 development:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><span>Python 3</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">ROS 1, <span>ROS 2</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Linux, <span>Bash, Git</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Notions of path planning and <span>collision avoidance</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Network and communication <span>protocols (optional)</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><span>C++ (optional)</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">To prepare for this internship, you see that you have to develop your Python, Linux, and <span>ROS skills.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">They also mention ROS 1. It is worth noting that, sometimes, ROS 1 is needed (to work on legacy projects), but you can learn it on the go. Sometimes, the person writing the job description doesn’t really understand the technology part of the job, and just adds all the possible keywords they encounter to make the offer look more general and attract more candidates. In this case, you will probably use ROS <span>2 anyway.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Path planning and collision avoidance are also included, meaning that exploring the Nav2 stack could give you a <span>competitive advantage.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">Job 2 – AI robotics internship</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Here is <a id="_idIndexMarker940" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>another internship where the focus is on <span>artificial intelligence:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><span>Machine learning</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Proficiency in Python, experience with PyTorch <span>or TensorFlow</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><span>ROS</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Enthusiasm for mobile and <span>intelligent robots</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">For this <a id="_idIndexMarker941" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>internship, machine learning will probably be the most important part of the job, while working with robots that are using ROS. Thus, for a job like this, you should equally learn about machine learning, if that’s <span>your interest.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">As you will see, many of the ROS jobs are not 100% centered around ROS. ROS is just one tool <span>they use.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">Job 3 – Humanoid robot development</h3>
			<p class="calibre3">Here are <a id="_idIndexMarker942" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>some requirements for a more intermediate <a id="_idIndexMarker943" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>job (one that requires working experience) where you participate in the development of a <span>humanoid robot:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><span>ROS 2</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Linux, Git, and <span>CI workflows</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><span>Jetson platforms</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Robot kinematics <span>and dynamics</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Control algorithms: force, <span>impedance, MPC</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10">Communication protocols: CAN, I2C, SPI, and <span>so on</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">In this job, robot control, communication protocols, and using them in an embedded Linux platform are crucial. The chances are that 80% of the challenge will be working on this, and then the rest will be about making it work with <span>ROS 2.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">I will stop here. The point was to show you that different jobs can require very different skill sets, even though they are all labeled as ROS jobs. Also, in some of them, ROS is the main focus, but many jobs use ROS only as a single tool among <span>many others.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">So, if there <a id="_idIndexMarker944" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>is a dream job you want to apply to, focus <a id="_idIndexMarker945" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>on the required skills first. To learn those skills, find a project that matches the skills, and then, as you go, find learning resou<a id="_idTextAnchor686" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>rces to help you complete <span>the project.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-319" class="calibre6"><a id="_idTextAnchor687" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we focused on what you can do after finishing this book to continue learning ROS 2 efficiently. This question can be quite tough to answer, and robotics is too vast for anyone to <span>master everything.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Learning for a specific goal (for example, a job application or a work/school project) is the best overall since you will learn things that you can <span>directly apply.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">If you don’t really know what to do, I also gave you a list of common ROS 2 stacks/frameworks, and other topics related to ROS 2 that you could learn. I strongly recommend that you learn those by doing projects, and focus on practical resources that teach you <span>by doing.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">If you liked this book and the way I teach, here are a few more resources <span>from me:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre9">
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Robotics Backend website</strong> (<a href="https://roboticsbackend.com/" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1">https://roboticsbackend.com/</a>): Here, you will find more written tutorials about ROS 2 and other <span>robotics-related topics</span></li>
				<li class="calibre10"><strong class="bold">Robotics Backend YouTube channel</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RoboticsBackend" class="pcalibre calibre4 pcalibre1">https://www.youtube.com/c/RoboticsBackend</a>): For video tutorials and free <span>crash courses</span></li>

			</ul>
			<p class="calibre3">As we saw in this chapter, you have now finished the discovery phase, and you enter the exploration phase. As you make progress and get better at what you do, you will start to find which field in particular you want to dive into. Depending on this, and the opportunities you get, you will start <span>to specialize.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">Until then, don’t overthink anything, and just learn/explore as much as possible. Start several projects, learn other technologies, and be curious. Also, don’t forget to have fun while learning and building projects. This is one of the most important things that will motivate you to <span>go further.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre3">I wish you good luck on your journey and hope this book has helped you get started on the <span>right foot!</span></p>

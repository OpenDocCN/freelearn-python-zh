    of the structures we will examine in this text are based. Although arrays provide
    good performance for static collections of data, our coding examples proved that
    they are inflexible and inefficient for many applications--so much so that even
    something as simple as adding or deleting an element from a collection is an extremely
    complex and costly operation.

- en: Lists are, in some ways, an evolution of the array. A list can be defined as
    a finite, ordered series of objects or values called **elements**. An empty list
    is a list with no elements, while the length of a list is the total number of
    elements in the collection. The first item in a list is called the **head**, while
    the last item is called the **tail**. In a list with a length of 1, the head and
    tail are the same object.

- en: Ordered lists should not be confused with sorted lists because lists can be
    either **sorted** or **unsorted**. Ordered simply means that each element has
    a defined position in the list. Objects in a sorted list have some type of relationship
    between them, while objects in an unsorted list have no notable relationship.
    For example, when my wife creates a shopping list, she sits down and carefully
    organizes the groceries in relation to how she knows the supermarket is arranged.
    Items on her list are types of groceries and they are arranged according to their
    relative positions in the supermarket so they have a *spatial relationship*. This
    is a sorted list. I, on the other hand, create a shopping list by slapping a piece
    of paper on the fridge and scribbling items on the paper as I notice shelves are
    empty or containers are missing. Although the items on my list are all types of
    groceries, they are not arranged in any particular way so they have *no notable
    relationship* to one another. This is an example of an unsorted list.

- en: One of the most common implementations of the list data structure is the *array-based*
    list. Generally speaking, an array-based list is simply a contiguous list of array
    positions, each holding a *pointer* to a list element. Since the list is based
    on an array, its functionality and performance are very similar to that of an
    array.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As seen in the previous examples, another common implementation is the **linked
    list**. A linked list is also a sequence of elements, except most implementations
    refer to the elements as **nodes**. In a linked list, the pointers to the elements
    are not contained in an array structure, but rather a pointer exists in memory
    to identify the first node. Then each node contains a link to the subsequent node
    in the list.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, there is the **doubly linked list**. In a doubly linked list, each
    node contains a link to both the subsequent node in the list and the previous
    node in the list. A doubly linked list makes traversing the list bidirectionally
    a much simpler process. The previous link in the head node and the next link in
    the tail node are both null. An alternative to this is to have the previous link
    in the head node point to the tail and the next link in the tail node point to
    the head, which changes the doubly linked list to a **circular linked list**.

    `LinkedList` classes in Java or C#, you are in fact working with a doubly linked
    list. C# and Java do not provide a **singly linked list** type, and the doubly
    linked list provides you with the same functionality and more, so you should never
    need one. However, you could easily implement one of your own if you really wanted
    to for academic purposes.

    with convenience methods allowing you to append, insert, and remove elements from
    the list. Both array-based and link-based lists provide access to the basic append,
    insert, and remove operations. However, the way in which these operations are
    implemented and their associated cost vary slightly between the two implementations.
    Where existing methods for this functionality are not baked in, it is typically

    Inserting an element into the list at index *i* requires us to shift all of the
    elements in positions greater than *i* one position toward the tail, meaning that
    we will need to perform *n* - *i* operations where there are *n* elements already
    in the list. Inserting at the head position is a worst-case operation, costing

    of the linked list over the array-based list is mutability. Unlike an array, a linked
    list is a series of discrete objects related to one another by memory pointers,
    so inserting or removing elements is simply a matter of adding or modifying those
    pointers. In other words, a linked list is capable of growing and shrinking to
    accommodate additions to and deletions from the collection in a very efficient
    manner.

    of a linked list is found in the `NSMutableArray` class. That's because `NSArray`
    and `NSMutableArray` are known as **class clusters**. Class clusters provide public
    APIs that are really abstract classes. When you initialize one of these classes
    you get back the concrete implementation of a data structure, which is custom
    tailored for the data you provided. These implementations can even change at runtime
    if the nature of the data set changes, making array classes extremely flexible.

    managing memory pointers is a tedious and often bug-prone task for the uninitiated.
    Most modern languages spare us from this drudgery through the use of some form
    of memory management device. C#, Java, and Swift use what's known as **Garbage
    Collection** (**GC**), while modern Objective-C provides **Automatic Reference

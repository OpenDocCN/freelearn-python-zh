<p class="my_basic">I would like to thank, with particular gratefulness, my friend and senior editor Victoria (Vicki) Austin for her assistance in copy editing the first edition. Without her, this book might not have reached its full potential. With her patient guidance and valuable and constructive suggestions, she helped me bring this book up to a higher level!</p>
<h3 id="toc_1">How This Book is Organized</h3>
<p class="my_basic">The book you hold in your hands follows the spiral curriculum teaching approach, a method proposed in 1960 by Jerome Bruner, an American psychologist. According to this method, as a subject is being taught, basic ideas are revisited at intervals—at a more sophisticated level each time—until the reader achieves a complete understanding of the subject. First, the reader learns the basic elements without worrying about the details. Later, more details are taught and basic elements are mentioned again and again, eventually being stored in the brain's long term memory.</p>
<p class="my_basic">According to Jerome Bruner, learning requires the student's active participation, experimentation, exploration, and discovery. This book contains many examples, most of which can be practically performed. This gives the readers the opportunity to get their hands on Python and become capable of creating their own programs.</p>
<h3 id="toc_2">Who Should Buy This Book?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Completely updated for the latest version of Python, this book offers a comprehensive introduction to programming, assuming no prior knowledge of the subject. It is designed for individuals eager to learn Python from scratch, providing a strong foundation in Algorithmic Thinking—the fundamental skill every aspiring programmer must acquire. Algorithmic Thinking encompasses more than just writing code; it entails mastering the art of problem-solving through coding.</p>
<p class="my_basic">This edition retains all the popular features of its predecessor while introducing a wealth of new exercises, along with extensive revisions and updates. Furthermore, brand-new chapters offer a practical introduction to working with text files.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Structured for both classroom use and independent study, each chapter is concluded with a set of questions and exercises designed to reinforce your understanding and apply what you've learned. With approximately 250 solved and 480 unsolved exercises, 500 true/false questions, 150 multiple-choice questions, and 200 review questions and crosswords (with solutions and answers available online), this book is ideal for:</p>
<p>►Novices or intermediate-level programmers pursuing self-study</p>
<p>►High school students</p>
<p>►First-years college or university students</p>
<p>►Educators</p>
<p>►Professors</p>
<p>►Anyone who wants to start learning or teaching computer programming using the best practices and techniques</p>

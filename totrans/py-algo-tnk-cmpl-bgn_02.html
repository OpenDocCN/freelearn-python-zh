<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1.1">Acknowledgments</span></h3>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">I would like to thank, with particular gratefulness, my friend and senior editor Victoria (Vicki) Austin for her assistance in copy editing the first edition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.2">Without her, this book might not have reached its full potential. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.3">With her patient guidance and valuable and constructive suggestions, she helped me bring this book up to a higher level!</span></p>
<h3 id="toc_1"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">How This Book is Organized</span></h3>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">The book you hold in your hands follows the spiral curriculum teaching approach, a method proposed in 1960 by Jerome Bruner, an American psychologist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.2">According to this method, as a subject is being taught, basic ideas are revisited at intervals—at a more sophisticated level each time—until the reader achieves a complete understanding of the subject. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.3">First, the reader learns the basic elements without worrying about the details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.4">Later, more details are taught and basic elements are mentioned again and again, eventually being stored in the brain's long term memory.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">According to Jerome Bruner, learning requires the student's active participation, experimentation, exploration, and discovery. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">This book contains many examples, most of which can be practically performed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">This gives the readers the opportunity to get their hands on Python and become capable of creating their own programs.</span></p>
<h3 id="toc_2"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Who Should Buy This Book?</span></h3>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Completely updated for the latest version of Python, this book offers a comprehensive introduction to programming, assuming no prior knowledge of the subject. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">It is designed for individuals eager to learn Python from scratch, providing a strong foundation in Algorithmic Thinking—the fundamental skill every aspiring programmer must acquire. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">Algorithmic Thinking encompasses more than just writing code; it entails mastering the art of problem-solving through coding.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">This edition retains all the popular features of its predecessor while introducing a wealth of new exercises, along with extensive revisions and updates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">Furthermore, brand-new chapters offer a practical introduction to working with text files.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Structured for both classroom use and independent study, each chapter is concluded with a set of questions and exercises designed to reinforce your understanding and apply what you've learned. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">With approximately 250 solved and 480 unsolved exercises, 500 true/false questions, 150 multiple-choice questions, and 200 review questions and crosswords (with solutions and answers available online), this book is ideal for:</span></p>

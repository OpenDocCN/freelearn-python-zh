Let's Get Started</h1></div></div></div><p>If you've picked up this book, then you are taking your first step toward building amazing projects using code. Some of you might want to make games, while others might want to learn more about how all of your favorite websites and apps actually work. If you follow the exercises in this book, you'll be able to do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Create fun games to play with your family and friends</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learn about the inner workings of your apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learn how to take charge of your computer</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Python projects for you"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Python projects for you</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> learn Python code. Specifically, you will learn how to design a computer program from the very beginning. It doesn't matter if you have never coded before because each exercise in this book is designed to get you ready to code. If you have coded before, you will find that this book has some really helpful exercises that can help make your code even better. Additionally, there are some more advanced projects toward the end of the book, which you should definitely take a look at!</p><div class="section" title="What can you do with Python?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>What can you do with Python?</h2></div></div></div><p>If you take a<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> look at the Web and search for Python jobs, you will find that many of the highest paying jobs are in Python. Why?</p><p>Python is a very flexible <a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>and powerful language in the following ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It can be used in order to go through millions of lines of data</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python can search for information on a website without having to go to the website itself</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is even used to host and design websites</li></ul></div><p>So, what will it take to learn Python? If you have never programmed, you will probably want to follow each lesson in order so that you can build the skills you need to make a game or another kind of computer program. The final project in this book will be a game. If you have some other programming experience, such as making modifications to your computer games, using programs such as Scratch or Logo or trying some of the free programming classes<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> on the Internet, then you might decide to skim this book first to see what you already know. It is still recommended that you follow the contents of this book in the order they are presented, as each project builds on the projects that were explained in the previous chapter.</p></div><div class="section" title="Why you should learn Python"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Why you should learn Python</h2></div></div></div><p>Python teaches all of the basics of an object-oriented programming language, and it is still very powerful. In fact, many Internet companies, most notably Mozilla Firefox and Google, use Python in part or all of their products! Python has also been used to build Django, a free framework to make websites.</p><p>It has also been<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> used to build many small video games by people learning about it as well as more advanced programmers. Finally, Python can be used to quickly read and analyze millions of lines of data very quickly! By learning Python, you will be prepared to build a variety of interesting projects, and you will gain the skills necessary to learn other programming languages if you choose to do so.</p></div></div></div>

You may also use a Raspberry Pi as it comes preinstalled with Python, pygame, and the other software needed to complete the projects in this book.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An Internet<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/> connection is necessary as some of the software you need to install on your computer might not be installed already. For example, Windows operating systems do not come with Python preinstalled, so an Internet connection will be needed; pygame is also not preinstalled on Windows, Mac, or Linux systems.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Along with an Internet connection, you will also need a web browser, such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome, or Internet Explorer, which will allow you to visit the Python documentation pages.</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>All of the code samples in this book are available for download on the Packt Publishing website.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Setting up your computer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Setting up your computer</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many <a id="id7" class="indexterm"/>different computer operating systems, but the most common operating systems are Macintosh (Mac), Windows, and Linux. You should follow the installation steps that go with your operating system. There are some subtle but important differences between the systems.</p><p>For the projects in this book, we will be using Python 2.7. While there are higher versions than this (3.x), these versions do not work dependably with pygame on Windows, Mac, or Ubuntu Linux as yet. However, this book will be written to use conventions that work in both versions of Python so that projects are easily completed on Raspberry Pi (which uses Python 3.x that's been specially configured with pygame) with just a few modifications. These modifications will be duly noted.</p><div class="section" title="For Mac and Ubuntu Linux users"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>For Mac and Ubuntu Linux users</h3></div></div></div><p>Mac and<a id="id8" class="indexterm"/> Linux systems share enough similarities that people<a id="id9" class="indexterm"/> who use either Mac or Linux can follow the same set of instructions.

There is a program called <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span> on both Mac and Linux operating systems. This program allows you to exercise a<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/> lot of control over<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/> your computer in these ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">On a Mac, go to <span class="strong"><strong>Finder</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Utilities</strong></span> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Terminal</strong></span>.

The terminal is a nice place to test snippets of Python code, but when we want to edit and save the code in order to use it over again, we will need a text editor. Although both Mac and Linux systems come with a text editor, there are some very nice, free editors that have good<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/> features. <span class="strong"><strong>jEdit</strong></span> is one of these editors.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>For Mac and Linux, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.jedit.org/">http://www.jedit.org/</a> and download jEdit.

Since Python is not installed by<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> default on Windows, some system adjustments <a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>need to be made to successfully run Python on your computer. If you are feeling uncertain about performing these system changes yourself, make sure to ask for help:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First, you will need to download version 2.7.11 of Python.<div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>Use the official Python <a id="id23" class="indexterm"/>website for the latest releases for Windows at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/</a>.</p><p>With Windows, you need to figure out if you are running 32-bit or 64-bit so that you can download the correct version of Python.

<div class="section" title="Write and run your first program in the command line"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Write and run your first program in the command line</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that you are<a id="id30" class="indexterm"/> set up, it is time to write your first line of<a id="id31" class="indexterm"/> code in Python! This line of code is almost a tradition for people who are programming for the first time, and it allows us to use one of the most basic, but most useful, functions in the Python language.</p><p>First, you need to start running a Python shell. On Mac or Linux, open your terminal and type this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>python</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>In the Mac or Ubuntu terminal, your resulting Python shell will look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>In Windows, type <code class="literal">Python</code> in the search bar at the bottom of the page. Then, select Python 2.7.11 from your apps. You will also have a Python shell open:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Once you see this<a id="id32" class="indexterm"/> symbol, your computer is now ready to work with the Python code. In your terminal or IDLE, type the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;print("Hello, world!")</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Once you have typed this, double-check to make sure that all of the spaces are exactly as they've been written. In Python, every space actually matters. Every punctuation mark matters. Once you have checked your code, hit <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span>.</p><p>What is your result or the <a id="id33" class="indexterm"/>output of your code? If the output looks like the following image, then great! You typed all of your code properly so the computer will understand what you want it to do. The expected output will be similar to what is shown here:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_01_08.jpg" alt="Write and run your first program in the command line"/></div><p>For Windows users, the output window will look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_01_09.jpg" alt="Write and run your first program in the command line"/></div><p>So, if your output does not look like the preceding code, you need to figure out what's wrong with it. Here are some<a id="id34" class="indexterm"/> of the reasons for this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Did you make<a id="id35" class="indexterm"/> a typing error?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Did you forget to use parenthesis or round brackets () for the words <code class="literal">'Hello, world!'</code>?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Did you forget to use the <code class="literal">''</code>single quotation marks for <code class="literal">Hello, world!</code>?</li></ul></div><p>If you still have a problem, compare your code to the sample input code and fix any mistakes. Then, try to run the code again.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>Python is what is called a <span class="emphasis"><em>case-sensitive</em></span> language. Python cares about uppercase, lowercase, and whitespace. You need to watch what you type. You might get some strange messages from your computer if you make a typing mistake or a syntax error.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Make yourself a work folder"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Make yourself a work folder</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we get started on any large projects, we need to make a work folder. In the next chapter, you will start <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>writing whole files of code that need to be run; therefore, we will need a place to put those files. Since you are setting up now, let's make a folder.</p><p>If you are very good at getting around your computer, you can put your folder wherever you want to.</p><p>If you are not too good at getting around your computer, you will probably want to put your folder on your desktop.</p><p>On both Mac and Windows machines, you can right-click somewhere on your desktop wallpaper, and a box will pop up with several options. One of the options will say <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span>, and when you hover over <span class="strong"><strong>New</strong></span>, you will get several other options. Choose <span class="strong"><strong>New Folder</strong></span>, and a new folder icon will appear on your desktop. It will be named <code class="literal">untitled</code>, so you should give it a better name.</p><p>To find your folder in the Mac or Linux terminals, respectively, open one of them and perform these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Run the <code class="literal">cd ..</code> command until you are at the root, which is often the name you have given to your computer. You may need to run the command three or four times.</li><li class="listitem">Now, you will be able to run python programs by typing <code class="literal">python3.5program.py</code>.</li></ol></div><p>To find your <a id="id37" class="indexterm"/>folder in the Windows command line, open the command prompt and perform these steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Run the <code class="literal">cd ..</code>command until you are at the root or <code class="literal">C:\&gt;</code>.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>If you are reading this, it is because you have made it through some of the tricky work of getting ready to learn to program projects with Python. Congratulations! Setting it up is always tough. Hopefully, you learned a bit more about the tools on your computer, such as the text editor and terminal that every programmer uses to do their daily work. Also, you learned about the Python <code class="literal">print()</code> function, and you should now be able to print out messages in your Python shell. The fun is just beginning as we have so much more to learn!</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn about the building blocks of Python programs. We'll start with variables and learn about all the different kinds of information we can put in them. Then, we will build some functions that put these variables together and help us make blocks of code that have special jobs. Finally, we will even learn how to make a computer ask a user questions and store their answers so that our programs can become interactive!</p></div></body></html>

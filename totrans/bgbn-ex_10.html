First we will learn about DC motors, followed by the L293D motor driver IC that will help us drive the DC motors. Then we will see how we can stream live video on a web page from the camera connected to the BeagleBone board. At the end we will build our own telecontrolled robot that you can control from a web page with a live video feed streaming from the camera connected to the BeagleBone Black.</p><p>The contents of this chapter are divided into:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Prerequisites</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">DC motors and the L293D motor driver IC</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Advanced Project: A tele-controlled robot with live video streaming</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec65"/>Prerequisites</h1></div></div></div><p>This topic will <a id="id426" class="indexterm"/>cover the parts you will need to get started with building the robot.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec66"/>DC motors</h1></div></div></div><p>A DC motor is a<a id="id428" class="indexterm"/> motor that runs using a DC power supply.</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_01.jpg" alt="DC motors"/></div><p>As shown in the preceding picture, it has two terminal wires. We can call one of these terminal wire positive and the other one negative. Usually, these wires are marked red and black where red is positive and black is negative. Although these wires are marked positive and negative, unlike the battery, where these polarities can't be mixed, here in the DC motors they can be mixed.</p><p>Say, for example, on a motor, if the positive wire is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and the negative wire is connected to the negative terminal of the battery, or the power source, the motor rotates in a clockwise direction. When you reverse the connection, say from the positive terminal of the motor to the negative terminal of the battery and the negative terminal of the motor to the positive terminal of the battery, then the motor will rotate in an anti-clockwise direction, as shown in the following picture:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_02.jpg" alt="DC motors"/></div><p>While the <a id="id429" class="indexterm"/>polarity of the voltage source's connection to terminals of the motor controls the DC motor's direction of rotation, the magnitude of the DC voltage source determines the speed of it.</p><p>But changing the polarity and switching the circuit on and off every time manually can be hectic job, and we need an electronic circuit that can help us do this without having to physically switch the connections. This is where motor driver ICs will come in useful to complete the task with digital inputs. One such motor driver IC is the L293D which will be discussing next.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec67"/>L293D motor driver IC</h1></div></div></div><p>As we <a id="id430" class="indexterm"/>mentioned previously, the L293D can be defined as a, H-Bridge motor driver circuit, which is made into a IC allowing us to drive a DC motor in either direction using digital inputs.</p><p>The pin configuration of the <strong>L293D</strong> is as shown in the following picture:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_03.jpg" alt="L293D motor driver IC"/></div><p>As shown in <a id="id431" class="indexterm"/>the preceding picture, in the L293D there are four input pins and four output pins. The two input pins, pin two and seven regulate the rotation of the motor connected to output pins three and six. Similarly, the input pins on the right, pin fifteen and ten regulate the rotation of the motor connected to output pins eleven and fourteen. The enable pins one and two, on the left and the right side of the IC on pin one and nine of the IC enables the operation of the output based on the input on that side of the IC. The motors rotate based on the inputs provided across the input pins as Logic <code class="literal">0</code> and Logic <code class="literal">1</code>. Supply <strong>5V</strong> to the <strong>Vcc</strong> pin of the IC for its operation, and connect the ground pins to the ground and negative pins of the power supply. And finally, you need to connect the positive of the DC power source/battery to the <strong>Vss</strong> pin to provide a power supply to the motor, and connect the negative of the power supply to the <strong>GND</strong> pin.</p><p>Consider the circuit connection as shown in the following picture:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_04.jpg" alt="L293D motor driver IC"/></div><p>For the circuit shown previously, when input 1 is LOW and input 2 is HIGH, the motor 1 will rotate in a<a id="id432" class="indexterm"/> clockwise direction, similarly when both inputs 1 and 2 are LOW or HIGH the motor will not rotate. This can be explained using a logic table:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

With this knowledge, you will have a clear idea of the concept of how the L293D operates. You can look at the datasheet of the L293D IC to get more details about the specifications and ratings of the IC. You can get this datasheet provided by the IC manufacturer on the Internet.</p><p>We will use the same circuit interfaced with the BeagleBone board at the end of the chapter to the build the robot in our final project. Now let's go ahead and see how we can  stream video live on the BeagleBone board using the USB camera connected to it.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec68"/>Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board</h1></div></div></div><p>To <a id="id433" class="indexterm"/>stream live video from Logitech HD webcam C270 USB camera, connected via local server to the BeagleBone board you need to have a<a id="id434" class="indexterm"/> software package that can do the job. But you also need to install some essential software before you download and compile the live video streaming software. Let's get started with the installation of the software packages by executing the following commands :</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo apt-get install imagemagick</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_05.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div><p>When <a id="id435" class="indexterm"/>you are prompted to continue the operation, type <code class="literal">Y</code>, as shown at the end of the preceding screenshot, and hit <code class="literal">Enter</code> to continue and finish the installation:</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_06.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo apt-get install subversion</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_07.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Now that <a id="id436" class="indexterm"/>we have installed all the prerequite softwares, let's download and compile the video streaming software.</p><p>First create a separate directory in the home directory, and put the contents of the streaming software inside it:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">mkdir mjpg</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_08.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Now let us change our working directory to the directory we created:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">cd mjpg</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_09.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Once you are in the <code class="literal">mjpg</code> directory, you can download the mjpg-streamer software package using the command given following from the URL mentioned in the command:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/mjpg-streamer/code/mjpg-streamer/ mjpg-streamer</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_10.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Once you have downloaded it there will be aa <code class="literal">mjpg-streamer</code> folder created, inside which you will have the <a id="id437" class="indexterm"/>source code of the software. Let's go ahead and change the directory to that first:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">cd mjpg-streamer</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_11.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Now our next step will be compile the software using the <code class="literal">make</code> command:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">make</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_12.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Once you <a id="id438" class="indexterm"/>have successfully compiled the software without errors you can go ahead and run the software using the following command:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">/mjpg_streamer -i "./input_uvc.so -d /dev/video0 -n -y" -o "./output_http.so -w ./www"</code></li></ul></div><p>If the Apache server is installed on your Debian package then it might show an error saying <strong>bind: Address already in use</strong> as shown in the following screenshot when you execute the preceding command to run the video streaming software:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_13.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div><p>This is due<a id="id439" class="indexterm"/> to port <code class="literal">8080</code> being used by default by the Apache server. In this case, to resolve the issue, we can change the port used by Apache to <code class="literal">8079</code>, or any other permited number as shown in the following screenshot, by changing the details in the <code class="literal">ports.conf</code> file:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_14.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Once you open the file you can change the <code class="literal">NameVirtualHost</code> to <code class="literal">8079</code> and <code class="literal">Listen</code> to <code class="literal">8079</code> port as shown in the following screenshot and save it:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_15.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div><p>Once you save it, you need to restart the Apache server to perform the changes. To do that, execute the <code class="literal">service restart</code> command:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo service apache2 restart</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_16.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Once you <a id="id440" class="indexterm"/>restart and get the output as shown in the preceding screenshot, it means the changes have been made. Now you can go ahead and run the streaming software by executing the following command:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo ./mjpg_streamer -i "./input_uvc.so -d /dev/video0 -n -y" -o "./output_http.so -w ./www"</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_17.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div></li></ul></div><p>If you see the output as shown in the previous screenshot, then the streaming software is running properly. We can test it by visiting the local server at port <code class="literal">8080</code> as shown in the following screenshot. The IP address is the IP address of the BeagleBone Black on your router, which is same as the one we used to login to the BeagleBone board.</p><p>Once you open the web link, you will see the streaming software's home webpage as shown on the next page:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_18.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div><p>The <a id="id441" class="indexterm"/>software description page with the details about which streaming software we are running on the BeagleBone board is shown in the previous screenshot. On the home page itself you can see the image captured from the camera but it's a static image which is not a live stream. To see the live stream, click on the <strong>Stream</strong> button on the left and it will show you the live streamed web page where you can see the live feed from the camera as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_19.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div><p>Click the <a id="id442" class="indexterm"/>button <strong>here</strong>, which is highlighted in red saying <strong>To see a simple example click here</strong>. You will see just the video feed separately as a image element on an HTML page as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_20.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div><p>A setup of the BeagleBone board with the USB camera whilst the live feed is being streamed <a id="id443" class="indexterm"/>is shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_21.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div><p>So, you can see that the BeagleBone and the power bank which are in front of the camera are visible on the live feed. If you just wave your hand in front of the camera you can see it live on the web page.</p><p>Now that we have seen the live video feed on this, if you want to include it on any HTML page you want to create, you can do so by adding the image source element created by the streaming software. You get the information of that image source by right clicking on the browser and hitting the inspect element which will show the details as shown in the following screenshot. Almost all of the browsers we use like Chrome, IE or Mozilla shows these details now, and you can learn more about this by browsing the Internet.</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_22.jpg" alt="Live video streaming on the BeagleBone board"/></div><p>The <a id="id444" class="indexterm"/>image element can be identified on the inspection block on the right side of the browser window where the details is mentioned as shown in the preceding screenshot:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;img src="img/?action=stream"&gt;</pre></div><p>We will be using this in our project at the end of this chapter to get a live feed on the web page using a Flask framework and Python. Now that we know how to get a live feed from the USB camera and integrate it on a webpage, let's go ahead to the next topic in this chapter where we will be building a robot with live video streaming.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec69"/>Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming</h1></div></div></div><p>First connect <a id="id445" class="indexterm"/>the motor driver IC with motors, power supply as shown in the following circuit:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_23.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>The whole <a id="id446" class="indexterm"/>setup will look like the following picture:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_24.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>So you can see from the preceding picture that the BeagleBone Black is connected to a USB hub to which the WiFi dongle and USB camera are connected. Also the L293D is connected to motors of the robot and an external 12V battery is used to drive the motors. The input pins of L293D are connected to the BeagleBone Black to control the L293D. The <a id="id447" class="indexterm"/>BeagleBone Black is powered using a mobile power bank using a USB to DC barrel connector cable, which you can make on your own as shown in the following picture:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_25.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>So why can't the BeagleBone board be powered using the inbuilt USB connection?. This is because the USB only draws 500mAh in total from the input supply, which isn't sufficient to power up the USB webcam and the Wi-Fi dongle.</p><p>Now, you can login into the BeagleBone Black and write the code to control the robot from the web page.</p><p>In this project, we will not be writing the code from scratch – instead we will be writing it by editing the code from our home automation project from <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Home Automation Using BeagleBone">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Home Automation Using BeagleBone</em>. So let's go ahead to the home automation directory in the Linux shell after logging into it:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">cd WorkSpace/HomeAutomation</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_26.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div></li></ul></div><p>If you list the contents in the directory using the <code class="literal">ls</code> command, you will see the following:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_27.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>Once you are in the home automation directory, let's first edit the HTML template:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">cd templates</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_28.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Now we <a id="id448" class="indexterm"/>can go ahead and edit the <code class="literal">main.html</code> file that we created in our home automation project and then save it as <code class="literal">Robot.html</code> file, as shown in following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_29.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>Once you have opened the <code class="literal">main.html</code> file, using the nano text editor, edit the content to make it look like the following screen shot: </p><div><img src="img/4602_10_30.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>You can see that we have added the image source element from our previous topic into this HTML file and added four buttons. Once you have saved the file, you can go ahead and make the changes in the Python file that we need to run in order to create a server using Python.</p><p>First let us go back to the home automation directory:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_31.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>Now let's open the <code class="literal">GPIOControlWebApp.py</code> file that we created in the home automation project:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_32.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>Edit the <a id="id449" class="indexterm"/>file as shown in the following screenshot and save it as <code class="literal">Robot.py</code>:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_33.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>Now you can run the Python code by using the following command:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sudo python Robot.py</code><div><img src="img/4602_10_34.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div></li></ul></div><p>Just <a id="id450" class="indexterm"/>running this code is not enough. We also need to run the streaming software to give our project the live video feed. So, login to the BeagleBone Black using another PuTTY session, and run the streaming software as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_35.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>When the streaming software and the Python code are running simulatneously, you can go ahead and check the server file by pointing your BeagleBone Black's IP address at port <code class="literal">5000</code>, from any browser, via a PC or mobile phone connected to the same local network same as to which the the BeagleBone board is connected. You will see the output shown in the picture on the next page, from where you can see the live feed and control the robot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_36.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>So, in the <a id="id451" class="indexterm"/>preceding screenshot you can see the robot's wheels. The setup is the same as that shown in the picture at the beginning of this topic, where the camera was pointing at the wheels of the robot. This will show you how the wheel movement works when you click on each button on the web page. We will discuss this next where you can see the wheel movement on the images themselves, as the wheel that is running will look blurred.</p><p>When <a id="id452" class="indexterm"/>you click for the forward button. Both motors run as discussed out previous chapter regarding the differential drive system. That is the motors will drive the robot in forward direction, you can see the difference in the following screenshot where the motors are running when compared with the previous image shown in the previous page of this chapter where the wheels are idle and not running.</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_37.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>You can also see the log of the movement in the Python output when you press the button as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_38.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>Similarly, for <a id="id453" class="indexterm"/>turning left, the right motor needs to be running and the left one stopped, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_39.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>And when you press the <strong>RIGHT</strong> button then the <strong>LEFT</strong> motor is running, and the <strong>RIGHT</strong> one is stopped, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/4602_10_40.jpg" alt="Advanced project – a telecontrolled robot with live video streaming"/></div><p>Similarly <a id="id454" class="indexterm"/>when you click on stop, both motors will be stopped. If you mount all these electronics on top of the robot as desired, you can make it drive around as a telecontrolled robot with a live feed carrying the BeagleBone Black with the camera. In this chapter I gave you all the resources you need to understand this idea. Now, you can go ahead and mount the electronics on the robot base. To find out how people make a simple prototyping shield with electronics soldered onto it on top of the hardware development boards. Just type in Google, <code class="literal">prototyping capes for BeagleBone</code> or <code class="literal">hats for raspberry pi and shields for Arduino</code>. Even though these are made for different hardware development boards like BeagleBone and Raspberry Pi, the same electronics can be mounted on a BeagleBone board with slight modifications which will help you get rid of the messy wiring. Also, try using the sub-process Python module to execute the shell command and start streaming software at the beginning of the Python code to start running the server. By using this sub-process you need not run two instances of PuTTY, you can finish your work with just one.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec70"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>With that we are at the end of this chapter, where we have learnt some basics about DC motors and their operation, as well finding out what an L293D motor driver IC is, and how we can use it to control a connected DC motor connected. Next, we saw how to live stream video on the local server with BeagleBone Black using mjpg-streamer package. Finally we worked on a project where we interfaced the L293D motor driver IC with the BeagleBone Black, and a live streaming image source, to HTML templates and controlled a robot using the input buttons on the webpage that we created using the Python and Flask web server framework.</p></div></body></html>

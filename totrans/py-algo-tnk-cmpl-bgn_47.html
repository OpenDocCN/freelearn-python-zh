<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter 100 positive numerical values into a list. Then, the program must create a new list of 98 elements. This new list must contain, in each position the average value of the three elements that exist in the current and the next two positions of the user-provided list.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's try to understand this exercise through an example using 10 elements.</p>

In list newArr, the element at position 0 is the average value of the elements in the current and the next two positions of list a; that is, (5 + 10 + 9) / 3 = 8.

<h4 id="toc_4">Exercise 33.1-3 Merging One-Dimensional Lists</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that, for two given lists a and b of 10 and 15 elements, respectively, creates a new list newArr of 25 elements. This new list must contain in the first 10 positions the elements of list a, and in the next 15 positions the elements of list b.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Since not all computer languages are so powerful in the field of data structures as Python, let's study three approaches here. The first one can be applied to most computer languages, whereas the second and the third ones are more Pythonic!</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see in the example presented next, there is a direct one-to-one correspondence between the index positions of the elements of list a and those of list newArr. Specifically, the element from position 0 of list a is stored in position 0 of list newArr, the element from position 1 of list a is stored in position 1 of list newArr, and so forth. However, this correspondence doesn't hold for list b; its elements need to be shifted by 10 positions in newArr.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width44" src="img/chapter33-02.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">In order to assign the values of list a to list newArr you can use the following code fragment.</p>
<div><p>for i in range(len(a)):</p>
<p>newArr[i] = a[i]</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">However, to assign the values of list b to list newArr your code fragment should be slightly different as shown here.</p>
<div><p>for i in range(len(b)):</p>
<p>newArr[len(a) + i] = b[i]</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The final Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_33.1-3a</div>
<div><p>#Create lists a and b</p>
<p>a = [5, 10, 9, 6, 7, -6, 13, 12, 11, 2]</p>
<p>b = [-11, 25, 4, 45, 67, 87, 34, 23, 33, 55, 13, 15, -4, -2, -22]</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Create list newArr</p>
<p>newArr = [None] * (len(a) + len(b))</p>

<p>newArr[len(a) + i] = b[i]</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Display list newArr</p>
<p>for i in range(len(newArr)):</p>
<p>print(newArr[i], end = "\t")</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach uses the append() method of Python.</p>

<div><p>#Create lists a and b</p>
<p>a = [5, 10, 9, 6, 7, -6, 13, 12, 11, 2]</p>
<p>b = [-11, 25, 4, 45, 67, 87, 34, 23, 33, 55, 13, 15, -4, -2, -22]</p>

<div></div>
<p>#Display list newArr</p>
<p>for i in range(len(newArr)):</p>
<p>print(newArr[i], end = "\t")</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Third approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach uses the magic forces of Python. In order to merge two lists in Python, you can simply use the concatenation operator ( + ). Python will do the rest for you!</p>

<h4 id="toc_5">Exercise 33.1-4 Creating Two Lists – Separating Positive from Negative Values</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter 100 numerical values into a list and then creates two new lists, pos and neg. List pos must contain positive values, whereas list neg must contain the negative ones. The value 0 (if any) must not be added to either of the final lists, pos or neg.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are two approaches! The first one can be applied to most computer languages, whereas the second one is more Pythonic!</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's analyze this approach using the following example.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width44" src="img/chapter33-03.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the index positions of the elements of list ar and the lists pos and neg. For example, the element from position 1 of list ar is not stored in position 1 of list neg, or the element from position 2 of list ar is not stored in position 2 of list pos. Thus, you cannot do the following,</p>
<div><p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>if ar[i] &gt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>pos[i] = ar[i]</p></blockquote></div>
<p>elif ar[i] &lt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>neg[i] = ar[i]</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">because it will result in the following two lists.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width36" src="img/chapter33-04.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">What you need here are two independent index variables: posIndex for the list pos, and negIndex for the list neg. These index variables must be incremented independently, and only when an element is added to the corresponding list. The index variable posIndex must be incremented only when an element is added to the list pos, and the index variable negIndex must be incremented only when an element is added to the list neg, as shown in the code fragment that follows.</p>
<div><p>posIndex = 0</p>
<p>negIndex = 0</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>if ar[i] &gt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>pos[posIndex] = ar[i]</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>posIndex += 1</p></blockquote></div>
<p>elif ar[i] &lt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>neg[negIndex] = ar[i]</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>negIndex += 1</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that variables posIndex and negIndex have dual roles. When the loop iterates, each points to the next position in which a new element must be placed. But when the loop finishes iterating, variables posIndex and negIndex also contain the total number of elements in each corresponding list!</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The complete solution is presented next.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_33.1-4a</div>
<div><p>ELEMENTS = 100</p>

<p>posIndex = 0</p>
<p>negIndex = 0</p>
<p>pos = [None] * ELEMENTS</p>
<p>neg = [None] * ELEMENTS</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>if ar[i] &gt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>pos[posIndex] = ar[i]</p></blockquote></div>

<div></div>
<p>print()</p>
<div></div>

<p>print(neg[i], end = "\t")</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that the lists pos and neg contain a total number of posIndex and negIndex elements respectively. This is why the two last loop control structures iterate until variable i reaches values posIndex − 1 and negIndex − 1, respectively, and not until ELEMENTS − 1, as you may mistakenly expect.</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">The first approach has a main disadvantage! The lists pos and neg must be initialized to a size of 100 because there is always a possibility that list ar contains only positive numbers, or probably only negative ones. Using the append() method, the next approach is more efficient than the previous one since it uses the least possible amount of main memory (RAM).</p>

<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Be careful! In Python, even though you can do something like x = y = 0, this is not true when it comes to lists. It is absolutely incorrect to write pos = neg = [] because both pos and neg would refer to the same list. You must use two individual statements, as shown in this approach.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter 100 two-digit integers into a list and then creates a new list of only the integers that contain at least one of the digit 5.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">This exercise requires some knowledge from the past. In <a href="chapter13.html#toc_3">Exercise 13.1-2</a> you learned how to use the quotient and the remainder to split an integer into its individual digits. Here, the user-provided integers have two digits; therefore, you can use the following code fragment to split any two-digit integer contained in variable x.</p>
<div><p>lastDigit = x % 10</p>
<p>firstDigit = x // 10</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">or a more Pythonic way is to use the divmod() function.</p>

</div>
<p class="my_basic">There are two approaches that you can use to solve this exercise! The first one can be applied to most computer languages, whereas the second one is more Pythonic!</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach uses an extra variable as an index for the new list. This is necessary when you want to create a new list using values from an old list and there is no one-to-one correspondence between their index positions. Of course, this variable must increase by 1 only when a new element is added into the new list. Moreover, when the loop that creates the new list finishes iterating, the value of this variable also matches the total number of elements in the new list! The final Python program is as follows.</p>

<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">As in the previous exercise, the main disadvantage of the first approach is that it initializes list b to a size of 100, regardless of the fact that the user may or may not enter integers that contain at least one instance of the digit 5!

<h3 id="toc_7">33.2 Data Validation with Lists</h3>
<p class="my_basic">As you have already been taught in <a href="chapter29.html#toc_11">Section 29.3</a>, there are three approaches that you can use to validate data input. Your approach will depend on whether or not you wish to display an error message, and whether you wish to display a different error message for each type of input error or just a generic error message for any kind of error.  Let's see how those three approaches can be adapted and used with lists.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Validating data input without error messages</p>
<p class="my_basic">In <a href="chapter29.html#toc_11">Section 29.3</a>, you learned how to validate one single value entered by the user without displaying any error messages. For your convenience, the code fragment given in general form is presented once again.</p>
<div><p>while True:</p>
<p>input_data = input("Prompt message")</p>
<p>if input_data test 1 succeeds and</p>
<p>input_data test 2 succeeds and</p>
<p>…</div>
<div>input_data test N succeeds: break</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Do you remember how this operates? If the user enters a valid value, the flow of execution simply proceeds to the next section of the program. However, if they enter an invalid value, the primary objective is to repeatedly prompt them until they eventually provide a valid one.</p>
<p class="my_basic">You can use the same principle when entering data into lists. If you use a for-loop to iterate for all elements of the list, the code fragment becomes as follows.</p>
<div><p>input_list = [None] * ELEMENTS</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS)</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>input_data = input("Prompt message")</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>if input_data test 1 succeeds and</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>input_data test 2 succeeds and</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>…</div></blockquote></blockquote></p>
<div><blockquote><p>input_data test N succeeds: break</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>input_list[i] = input_data</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see, when the flow of execution exits the nested post-test loop structure, the variable input_data definitely contains a valid value which in turn is assigned to an element of the list input_list. However, the same process can be implemented more simply, without using the extra variable input_data, as follows.</p>
<div><p>input_list = [None] * ELEMENTS</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>input_list[i] = input("Prompt message")</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>if input_list[i] test 1 succeeds and</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>input_list[i] test 2 succeeds and</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>…</div></blockquote></p>
<div><blockquote><p>input_list[i] test N succeeds: break</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Validating data input with a generic error message</p>
<p class="my_basic">As before, the next code fragment is taken from <a href="chapter29.html#toc_11">Section 29.3</a> and adapted to operate with a list. It validates data input and displays a generic error message (that is, the same error message for any type of input error).</p>
<div><p>input_list = [None] * ELEMENTS</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>input_list[i] = input("Prompt message")</p>
<p>while input_list[i] test 1 fails or</p>
<div><blockquote><p>input_list[i] test 2 fails or</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>…</div></blockquote></p>
<div><blockquote><p>input_list[i] test N fails:</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>print("Error message")</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>input_list[i] = input("Prompt message")</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="strong">Third approach – Validating data input with different error messages</p>
<p class="my_basic">Once again, the next code fragment is taken from <a href="chapter29.html#toc_11">Section 29.3</a> and adapted to operate with a list. It validates data input and displays a different error message for each type of input error.</p>
<div><p>input_list = [None] * ELEMENTS</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>input_list[i] = input("Prompt message")</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>failure = False</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>if input_list[i] test 1 fails:</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>print("Error message 1")</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>failure = True</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>elif input_list[i] test 2 fails:</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>print("Error message 2")</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>failure = True</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>elif …</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>…</div></blockquote></p>

<p class="my_basic">This is the third and last time that this subject is brought up in this book. The first time was in <a href="chapter22.html#toc_8">Section 22.2</a> using decision control structures and the second time was in <a href="chapter29.html#toc_14">Section 29.4</a> using loop control structures. So, there is not much left to discuss except the fact that when you want to find the minimum or maximum value of a data structure that already contains some values, you needn't worry about the initial values of variables minimum or maximum because you can just assign to them the value of the first element of the data structure!</p>

<p class="my_basic">After the user enters the depths of the 20 lakes in the list depths, the initial value of variable maximum can be set to the value of depths[0], that is, the first element of list depths.

<p class="my_basic">Sorting algorithms are an important topic in computer science. A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. There are many sorting algorithms and each one of them has particular strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Most sorting algorithms work by comparing the elements of the list. They are usually evaluated by their efficiency and their memory requirements.</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are many sorting algorithms. Some of them are:</p>
<p>►the bubble sort algorithm</p>
<p>►the modified bubble sort algorithm</p>
<p>►the selection sort algorithm</p>
<p>►the insertion sort algorithm</p>
<p>►the heap sort algorithm</p>
<p>►the merge sort algorithm</p>
<p>►the quicksort algorithm</p>
<p class="my_basic">As regards their efficiency, the bubble sort algorithm is considered the least efficient, while each succeeding algorithm in the list performs better than the preceding one. The quicksort algorithm is considered one of the best and fastest sorting algorithms, especially for large scale data operations.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Sorting algorithms can be used for more than just displaying data in ascending or descending order; they can also assist in finding the minimum and the maximum values from a set of given values. For instance, in a list sorted in ascending order, the minimum value exists at the first index position and the maximum value exists at the last index position. While sorting a list solely for the purpose of finding the minimum and maximum values is very inefficient, if a program sorts a list for other reasons, and you subsequently need the minimum or maximum value, you know where you can find them!</p>
<p class="my_basic">Another scenario where you might need sorting algorithms is when you want to find and display, for example, the three largest (or smallest) numbers in a list. In this case, you can sort the list in descending order and then display only the first three elements, located at index positions 0, 1, and 2.</p>
<p class="my_basic">As you already know, Python incorporates the method sort() and the function sorted() for list sorting. However, there are situations where it's necessary to implement a custom sorting algorithm, especially when you need to sort a list while preserving the one-to-one correspondence with the elements of a second list.</p>
<h4 id="toc_18">Exercise 33.4-1 The Bubble Sort Algorithm – Sorting One-Dimensional Lists with Numeric Values</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter 20 numerical values into a list and then sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The bubble sort algorithm is probably one of the most inefficient sorting algorithms but it is widely used for teaching purposes. The main idea (when asked to sort a list in ascending order) is to repeatedly move the smallest elements of the list to the positions of lowest index. This works as follows: the algorithm iterates through the elements of the list, compares each pair of adjacent elements, and then swaps their contents (if they are in the wrong order). This process is repeated many times until the list is sorted.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For example, let's try to sort the following list in ascending order.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width10" src="img/chapter33-08.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The lowest value is the value 5. According to the bubble sort algorithm, this value must gradually “bubble” or “rise” to position 0, like bubbles rising in a glass of cola. When the value 5 has been moved into position 0, the next smallest value is the value 8. Now, the value 8 must “bubble” to position 1. Next is the value 12, which must “bubble” to position 2, and so on. This process repeats until all elements are placed in proper position.</p>
<p class="my_basic">But how can this “bubbling” be done using an algorithm? Let's see the whole process in more detail. For the previous list A of six elements, five passes must be performed.</p>
<p class="strong">First Pass</p>
<p class="my_basic">1st Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Initially, elements at index positions 4 and 5 are compared. Since the value 12 is less than the value 49, these two elements swap their content.</p>
<p class="my_basic">2nd Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Elements at index positions 3 and 4 are compared. Since the value 12 is not less than the value 5, no swapping is done.</p>
<p class="my_basic">3rd Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Elements at index positions 2 and 3 are compared. Since the value 5 is less than the value 8, these two elements swap their content.</p>
<p class="my_basic">4th Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Elements at index positions 1 and 2 are compared. Since the value 5 is less than the value 25, these two elements swap their content.</p>
<p class="my_basic">5th Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Elements at index positions 0 and 1 are compared. Since the value 5 is less than the value 17, these two elements swap their content.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width38" src="img/chapter33-09.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The first pass has been completed but, as you can see, the list has not been sorted yet. The only value that is guaranteed to be placed in proper position is the value 5. However, since more passes will follow, there is no need for the value 5 to take part in the subsequent compares. In the pass that follows, one less compare will be performed—that is, four compares.</p>
<p class="strong">Second Pass</p>
<p class="my_basic">1st Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Elements at index positions 4 and 5 are compared. Since the value 49 is not less than the value 12, no swapping is done.</p>
<p class="my_basic">2nd Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Elements at index positions 3 and 4 are compared. Since the value 12 is not less than the value 8, no swapping is done.</p>
<p class="my_basic">3rd Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Elements at index positions 2 and 3 are compared. Since the value 8 is less than the value 25, these two elements swap their content.</p>
<p class="my_basic">4th Compare</p>
<p class="my_basic">Elements at index positions 1 and 2 are compared. Since the value 8 is less than the value 17, these two elements swap their content.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width44" src="img/chapter33-10.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The second pass has been completed and the value of 8 is guaranteed to be placed in proper position. However, since more passes will follow, there is no need for the value 8 (nor 5, of course) to take part in the subsequent compares. In the pass that follows, one less compare will be performed—that is, three compares.</p>
<p class="strong">Third Pass</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this pass, three compares (but only two swaps) are performed, as shown below.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width31" src="img/chapter33-11.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The third pass has been completed and the value of 12 is guaranteed to be placed in proper position. As previously, since more passes will follow there is no need for the value 12 (nor the values 5 and 8, of course) to take part in the subsequent compares. In the pass that follows, one compare less will be performed—that is, two compares.</p>
<p class="strong">Fourth Pass</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this pass, two compares (and no swaps) are performed, as shown below.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width23" src="img/chapter33-12.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The fourth pass has been completed and the value 17 is guaranteed to be placed in proper position. As previously, since one last pass will follow, there is no need for the value 17 (nor the values 5, 8, and 12, of course) to take part in the subsequent compares. In the last pass that follows, one compare less will be performed—that is one compare.</p>
<p class="strong">Fifth pass</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this last pass, only one compare is performed. Since the value 49 is not less than the value 25, no swapping is done.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width15" src="img/chapter33-13.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The fifth pass has been completed and the final two values (25 and 49) are now guaranteed to be in proper positions. The bubble sort algorithm has finished and the list is sorted in ascending order!</p>
<p class="my_basic">Now you need a Python program that can do the whole previous process. Let's use the “from inner to outer” method. The code fragment that performs only the first pass is shown below. Please note that this is the inner (nested) loop control structure. Assume variable m contains the value 0.</p>
<div><p>for n in range(ELEMENTS - 1, m, -1):</p>
<p>if a[n] &lt; a[n - 1]:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>temp = a[n]</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>a[n] = a[n - 1]</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>a[n - 1] = temp</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In the first pass, variable m must contain the value 0. This assures that at the last iteration, the elements that are compared are those at index positions 1 and 0.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Swapping the contents of two elements uses a method you have already learned! Please recall the two glasses of orange juice and lemon juice. If this doesn't ring a bell, you need to refresh your memory and re-read <a href="chapter08.html#toc_4">Exercise 8.1-3</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Keep in mind that you can swap the contents of a[n] and a[n − 1] in a more Pythonic way, as shown here.</p>
<div><p>for n in range(ELEMENTS - 1, m, -1):</p>
<p>if a[n] &lt; a[n - 1]:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>a[n], a[n - 1] = a[n - 1], a[n]</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The second pass can be performed if you just re-execute the previous code fragment. Variable m, however, needs to contain the value 1. This will ensure that the element at index position 0 won't be compared again. Similarly, for the third pass, the previous code fragment can be re-executed but variable m needs to contain the value 2 for the same reason.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Accordingly, the previous code fragment needs to be executed five times (one for each pass), and each time variable m must be incremented by 1. The final code fragment that sorts list a using the bubble sort algorithm is as follows.</p>
<div><p>for m in range(ELEMENTS - 1):</p>
<p>for n in range(ELEMENTS - 1, m, -1):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>if a[n] &lt; a[n - 1]:</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>a[n], a[n - 1] = a[n - 1], a[n]</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>For N elements, the algorithm needs to  perform N − 1 passes. For example, if list a contains 20 elements, the statement for m in range(ELEMENTS - 1) performs 19 passes.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a code fragment that sorts the alphanumeric values of a list in descending order using the bubble sort algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Comparing the wording of this exercise to the previous one, two things are different. First, the bubble sort algorithm needs to sort alphanumeric values, such as names of people or names of cities; and second, it has to sort them in descending order.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In order to sort alphanumeric data, you don't have to change anything in the algorithm! Python handles letters the same way it handles numbers. The letter “A” is considered “less than” the letter “B”, “B” is considered “less than” the letter “C”, and so on. Of course, if the list contains words in which the first letter is identical, Python moves on to compare their second letter and perhaps their third letter (if necessary). For example, the name “Johathan” is considered “less than” the name “Jone” as the fourth letter “a” is “less than” the fourth letter “e”.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Consider the alphanumeric sorting in the context of how words are organized in an English dictionary.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's see what you need to change so that the algorithm can sort in descending order instead of ascending. Do you remember how the bubble sort algorithm actually works? Elements gradually “bubble” to positions of lowest index, like bubbles rise in a glass of cola. What you want in this exercise is to make the bigger (instead of the smaller) elements “bubble” to lower index positions. Therefore, all you need to do is simply reverse the comparison operator of the decision control structure!</p>
<p class="my_basic">The code fragment that sorts alphanumeric, and of course numeric, values in descending order is as follows.</p>

<p class="my_basic">If you want to sort list areas while preserving the one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two lists, you must rearrange the elements of the list names as well. This means that every time two elements of the list areas swap contents, the corresponding elements of the list names must swap contents as well. The Python program is as follows.</p>

The program must then display the names with the last names sorted in alphabetical order. In cases where two or more people share the same last name, their first names should be displayed in alphabetical order.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">You already know how to sort a list while preserving the one-to-one correspondence with the elements of a second list. Now, you have to handle the case when two last names in the first list are equal. According to the wording of the exercise, the corresponding first names in the second list must also be sorted alphabetically. For example, the following list lastNm contains the last names of 100 people. It is sorted in alphabetical order and it contains the last name “Parker” three times. The corresponding first names “Andrew”, “Anna”, and “Chloe”, in list firstNm also have to be sorted alphabetically, as shown here.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width36" src="img/chapter33-16.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">For your convenience, the basic version of the bubble sort algorithm is presented once again here. Please note that this algorithm preserves the one-to-one correspondence between the elements of lists lastNm and firstNm.</p>

</div>
<p class="my_basic">To solve this exercise, however, this bubble sort algorithm must be adapted correspondingly. According to this basic version of the bubble sort algorithm, when the last name at position n is “less” than the last name at position n − 1, the algorithm swaps the corresponding contents. However, if the last names at these positions are equal, the algorithm must then verify whether the corresponding first names are in the correct order. If not, a swap is required in the list firstNm. The adapted bubble sort algorithm is depicted in the following code fragment.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter the weights of 20 people and then displays the three heaviest weights and the three lightest weights. Use the modified bubble sort algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">To solve this exercise, the Python program can sort the user-provided data in ascending order and then display the elements at index positions 17, 18, and 19 (for the three heaviest weights) and the elements at index positions 0, 1 and 2 (for the three lightest weights). But what is that modified version of the bubble sort algorithm, and how does it actually work? Suppose you have the following list containing the weights of six people.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width23" src="img/chapter33-18.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">If you look closer, you can confirm for yourself that the only elements not in the proper position are those at index positions 3 and 4. If you swap their values, the list w immediately becomes sorted! Unfortunately, the bubble sort algorithm doesn't operate this way. For this given list of six elements, it will perform five passes either way, with a total of <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter33-19.png"/> compares, where N is the total number of list elements. For larger lists, the total number of compares that the bubble sort algorithm performs increases exponentially! For example, for a given list of 1000 elements, the bubble sort algorithm performs 499,500 compares!</p>
<p class="my_basic">Of course the modified bubble sort algorithm can overcome this situation as follows: if a complete pass is performed and no swaps have been made, then this indicates that the list is now sorted and there is no need for further passes. To accomplish this, the Python program can use a flag variable that indicates if any swaps were made. At the beginning of a pass, a value of False can be assigned to the flag variable; when a swap is made, a value of True is assigned. If, at the end of the pass, the flag is still False, this indicates that no swaps have been made, thus iterations must stop. The modified bubble sort is shown next. It uses the break statement and the flag variable swaps.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a code fragment that sorts the elements of a list in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The selection sort algorithm is inefficient for large scale data, as is the bubble sort algorithm, but it generally performs better than the latter. It is the simplest of all the sorting algorithms and performs well on computer systems in which limited main memory (RAM) comes into play.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The algorithm finds the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element of the list and swaps its content with that at position 0. Then the process is repeated for the remainder of the list; the next smallest (or largest) element is found and put into the next position, until all elements are examined.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For example, let's try to sort the following list in ascending order.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width24" src="img/chapter33-20.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The lowest value is the value 4, found at position 4. According to the selection sort algorithm, this element swaps its content with the element at position 0. The list A becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width24" src="img/chapter33-21.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The lowest value in the remainder of the list (index positions 1 to 5) is the value 9, found at position 5. This element swaps its content with the element at position 1. The list A becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width24" src="img/chapter33-22.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The lowest value in the remainder of the list (index positions 2 to 5) is the value 18, found at position 4. This element swaps its content with the element at position 2. The list A becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width24" src="img/chapter33-23.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Proceeding the same way, the next lowest value is the value 19, found at position 5. The list A becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width24" src="img/chapter33-24.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The next lowest value is the value 36, found at position 5. This element swaps its content with the element at position 4 and the list A is finally sorted in ascending order!</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width24" src="img/chapter33-25.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's write the corresponding Python program. The “from inner to outer” method is used in order to help you better understand the whole process. The next code fragment finds the smallest element and then swaps its content with that at position 0. Please note that this is the inner (nested) loop control structure. Assume variable m contains the value 0.</p>
<div><p>minimum = a[m]</p>
<p>indexOfMin = m</p>
<p>for n in range(m, ELEMENTS):</p>

<div></div>
<p>#Minimum found! Now, swap values.</p>
<p>a[m], a[indexOfMin] = a[indexOfMin], a[m]</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, in order to repeat the process for all elements of the list, you can nest this code fragment within a for-loop that iterates for all elements. The final selection sort algorithm that sorts a list in ascending order is as follows.</p>
<div><p>for m in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>minimum = a[m]</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the total number of kWh consumed each month for a period of one year. It then displays the three months with the highest consumption of kWh, along with the corresponding number of KWh (in descending order). Use the selection sort algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise you need the following two one-dimensional lists.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width28" src="img/chapter33-26.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">While the selection sort algorithm sorts the elements of list kwh, the one-to-one correspondence with the elements of list months must be preserved. This means that every time two elements of list kwh swap contents, the corresponding elements of list months must swap their contents as well.</p>
<p class="my_basic">However, given that you solely require the three months with the highest consumption of KWh, the selection sort algorithm should sort only the first three elements. The Python program is as follows.</p>

<p>#Swap values of kwh</p>
<p>kwh[m], kwh[indexOfMax] = kwh[indexOfMax], kwh[m]</p>
<p>#Swap values of months</p>

<div></div>
<p>for i in range(3):</p>
<p>print(months[i], ":", kwh[i])</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>If this exercise required the use of the bubble sort instead of the selection sort algorithm, you could employ the same “trick”. The algorithm could perform 3 passes instead of ELEMENTS – 1 passes.</p>

<h4 id="toc_26">Exercise 33.4-9 The Insertion Sort Algorithm – Sorting One-Dimensional Lists</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a code fragment that sorts the elements of a list in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The insertion sort algorithm is inefficient for large scale data, as are the selection and the bubble sort algorithms, but it generally performs better than either of them. Moreover, the insertion sort algorithm can prove very fast when sorting very small lists— sometimes even faster than the quicksort algorithm.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The insertion sort algorithm resembles the way you might sort playing cards. You start with all the cards face down on the table. The cards on the table represent the unsorted “list”. In the beginning your left hand is empty, but in the end this hand will hold the sorted cards. The process goes as follows: you remove from the table one card at a time and insert it into the correct position in your left hand. To find the correct position for a card, you compare it with each of the cards already in your hand, from right to left. At the end, there must be no cards on the table and your left hand will hold all the cards, sorted.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For example, let's try to sort the following list in ascending order. To better understand this example, assume that the sorting process has already begun and the first three elements of the list have been sorted.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width29" src="img/chapter33-27.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The elements at index positions 0, 1, and 2 represent the cards in your left hand, while the remaining elements of the list represent the unsorted cards on the table.</p>

<p class="my_basic">The element at position 3 (which is 8) is removed from the list and all elements on its left with a value greater than 8 are shifted to the right. The list A becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width29" src="img/chapter33-28.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Now that a position has been released, the value 8 is inserted in there. The list becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width29" src="img/chapter33-29.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The element at position 4 (which is 10) is removed from the list and all elements on its left with a value greater than 10 are shifted to the right. The list A becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width29" src="img/chapter33-30.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Now that a position has been released, the value of 10 is inserted in there. The list becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width29" src="img/chapter33-31.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The element at position 5 (which is 18) is removed from the list and all elements on its left with a value greater than 18 are shifted to the right. The list A becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width29" src="img/chapter33-32.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The value of 18 is inserted in the released position. The list becomes</p>

<p class="my_basic">The element at position 6 (which is 9) is removed from the list and all elements on its left with a value greater than 9 are shifted to the right. The list A becomes</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width29" src="img/chapter33-34.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Finally, the value of 9 is inserted in the released position, the algorithm finishes and the list is now sorted.</p>

<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>What the algorithm actually does is to check the unsorted elements one by one and insert each one in the appropriate position among those considered already sorted.</p>

<p class="my_basic">In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm that searches for an item with specific features within a set of data. In the case of a data structure, a search algorithm searches the data structure to find the element, or elements, that equal a given value.</p>
<p class="my_basic">When searching in a data structure, there can be two situations.</p>
<p>►You want to search for a given value in a data structure that may contain the same value multiple times. Therefore, you need to find all the elements (or their corresponding indexes) that are equal to that given value.</p>
<p>►You want to search for a given value in a data structure where each value is unique. Therefore, you need to find just one element (or its corresponding index), the one that is equal to that given value, and then stop searching any further!</p>
<p class="my_basic">The most commonly used search algorithms are:</p>
<p>►the linear (or sequential) search algorithm</p>
<p>►the binary search algorithm</p>
<p class="my_basic">Both linear and binary search algorithms have advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The linear (or sequential) search algorithm checks if the first element of the list is equal to a given value, then checks the second element, then the third, and so on until the end of the list.

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a code fragment that performs a search on each row of a two-dimensional list to find a user-provided value. Assume that the list contains numerical values and may contain the same value multiple times. Use the linear search algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">This code fragment must search for the user-provided number in each row of a two-dimensional list that may contain the same value multiple times. This means that the code fragment must search in the first row and display all the columns where the user-provided number is found; otherwise, it must display a message that the user-provided number was not found in the first row. Then, it must search in the second row, and this process must continue until all rows have been examined.</p>
<p class="my_basic">To better understand this exercise, the “inner to outer” method is used. The following code fragment searches for a given value (variable needle) only in the first row of the two-dimensional list named haystack. Assume variable i contains the value 0.</p>
<div><p>found = False</p>
<p>for j in range(COLUMNS):</p>
<p>if haystack[i][j] == needle:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>print("Found at column", j)</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>if not found:</p>
<p>print("Nothing found in row", i)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, in order to search in all rows, you need to nest this code fragment in a for-loop that iterates for all of them, as follows.</p>
<div><p>needle = float(input("Enter a value to search: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>for i in range(ROWS):</p>
<p>found = False</p>
<p>for j in range(COLUMNS):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>if haystack[i][j] == needle:</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>print("Found at column", j)</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>

<h4 id="toc_32">Exercise 33.5-4 The Linear Search Algorithm – Searching in a One-Dimensional List that Contains Unique Values</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a code fragment that performs a search on a one-dimensional list to find a user-provided value. Assume that the list contains numerical values and each value in the list is unique. Use the linear search algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">This case is quite different from the previous ones. Since each value in the list is unique, when the user-provided value is found, there is no need to iterate without reason until the end of the list, thus wasting CPU time. There are three approaches, actually! Let's analyze them all!</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Using the break statement</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, when the user-provided value is found, a break statement is used to break out of the for-loop. The solution is as follows.</p>
<div><p>needle = float(input("Enter a value to search: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>found = False</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>if haystack[i] == needle:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>print(needle, "found at position:", i)</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>break</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>if not found:</p>
<p>print("Nothing found!")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Or you can do the same, in a little bit different way.</p>
<div><p>needle = float(input("Enter a value to search: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>indexPosition = -1</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>if haystack[i] == needle:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>indexPosition = i</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>break</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>if indexPosition == -1:</p>
<p>print("Nothing found!")</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print(needle, "found at position:", indexPosition)</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Using a flag</p>
<p class="my_basic">The break statement doesn't actually exist in all computer languages; and since this book's intent is to teach you “Algorithmic Thinking” (and not just special statements that only Python supports), let's look at an alternate approach.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In the next code fragment, when the user-provided value is found within list haystack, the variable found forces the flow of execution to immediately exit the loop.</p>
<div><p>needle = float(input("Enter a value to search: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>found = False</p>
<p>i = 0</p>
<p>while i &lt; ELEMENTS and not found:</p>
<p>if haystack[i] == needle:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>indexPosition = i</p></blockquote></div>
<p>i += 1</p>
<div></div>
<p>if not found:</p>
<p>print("Nothing found!")</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print(needle, "found at position:", indexPosition)</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Third approach – Using only a pre-test loop structure</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach is likely the most efficient among the three. The while-loop iterates through the list, comparing each element with the needle. The loop continues as long as two conditions are met: variable i (representing the index) is within the valid range for the list haystack, and the value at the current index in the list is not equal to the needle. If both conditions are True, variable i is incremented to move to the next element. This process continues until a match is found or until the end of the list is reached.</p>
<div><p>needle = float(input("Enter a value to search: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>i = 0</p>
<p>while i &lt; ELEMENTS - 1 and haystack[i] != needle:</p>
<p>i += 1</p>
<div></div>
<p>if haystack[i] != needle:</p>
<p>print("Nothing found!")</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print(needle, "found at position:", i)</p>

The program must then ask the user for an SSN, upon which it will search and display the first and last name of the person who holds that SSN.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In the United States, there is no possibility that two or more people will have the same SSN. Thus, even though it is not clear in the wording of the exercise, each value in the list that holds the SSNs is unique!</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter numeric values into a 20 × 30 list. After all of the values have been entered, the program then lets the user enter a value. In the end, a message must be displayed if the user-provided value exists, at least once, in each column of the list.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">This exercise can be solved using the linear search algorithm and a counter variable count. The Python program will iterate through the first column; if the user-provided value is found, the Python program must stop searching in the first column thereafter, and the variable count must increment by one. Then, the program will iterate through the second column; if the user-provided value is found again, the Python program must stop searching in the second column thereafter, and the variable count must once more increment by one. This process must repeat until all columns have been examined. At the end of the process, if the value of count is equal to the total number of columns, this means that the user-provided value exists, at least once, in each column of the list.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's use the “from inner to outer” method. The following code fragment searches in first column (column index 0) of the list and if the user-provided value is found, the flow of execution exits the for-loop and variable count increments by one. Assume variable j contains the value 0.</p>

<h4 id="toc_36">Exercise 33.5-8 The Binary Search Algorithm – Searching in a Sorted One-Dimensional List</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a code fragment that performs a search on a sorted one-dimensional list to find a given value. Use the binary search algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The binary search algorithm is considered very fast and can be used with large scale data. Its main disadvantage, though, is that the data need to be sorted.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The main idea of the binary search algorithm is to first examine the element in the middle of the list. If it does not match the “needle in the haystack” that you are looking for, the algorithm determines whether the target is smaller or larger than the middle element. This guides the search to the corresponding half of the list. In other words, if the “needle” you are looking for is smaller than the value of the middle element, it means that the “needle” might be in the first half of the list; otherwise it might be in the last half of the list. The process continues, narrowing down the search by checking the middle element in the remaining half of the list until the "needle" is found or the portion of the list being examined is reduced to a single element. If the latter occurs without finding the "needle," it means the “needle” is not present in the list.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Confused? Let's try to analyze the binary search algorithm through an example. The following list contains numeric values in ascending order. Assume that the “needle” that you are looking for is the value 44.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width40" src="img/chapter33-38.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Three variables are used. Initially, variable left contains the value 0 (this is the index of the first element), variable right contains the value 13 (this is the index of the last element) and variable middle contains the value 6 (this is approximately the index of the middle element).</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width40" src="img/chapter33-39.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The “needle” (value 44) that you are looking for is larger than the value of 39 in the middle, thus the element that you are looking for might be in the last half of the list. Therefore, variable left is updated to point to index position 7 and variable middle is updated to a point in the middle between left (the new one) and right, as shown below.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width40" src="img/chapter33-40.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Now, the “needle” (value 44) that you are looking for is smaller than the value of 57 in the middle, thus the element that you are looking for might be in the first half of the portion of the list being examined. Therefore, it is the variable right that is now updated to point to index position 9, and variable middle is updated to point to the middle between left and right (the new one), as shown below002E</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width40" src="img/chapter33-41.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">You are done! The “needle” has been found at index position 8 and the whole process can stop!</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Each unsuccessful comparison reduces the number of elements left to check by half!</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The index variables left and right each time point to the beginning and end, respectively, of the portion of the list being examined.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's see the corresponding code fragment.</p>
<div><p>left = 0</p>
<p>right = ELEMENTS - 1</p>
<p>found = False</p>
<p>while left &lt;= right and not found:</p>
<p>middle = (left + right) // 2   #This is a DIV 2 operation</p>
<div></div>
<p>if needle &lt; haystack[middle]:  #If the needle is in the first half of the portion</p>
<div><blockquote><p>right = middle – 1         #of the list being examined, update the right index</p></blockquote></div>
<p>elif needle &gt; haystack[middle]:  #If it is in the second half,</p>
<div><blockquote><p>left = middle + 1            #update the left index</p></blockquote></div>
<p>else:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>if not found:</p>
<p>print("Nothing found!")</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print(needle, "found at position:", middle)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The binary search algorithm is very efficient because it drastically reduces the search space with each iteration, making it highly effective for sorted lists. Using this algorithm on the example list, the value of 44 can be found within just three iterations. In contrast, the linear search algorithm would require nine iterations for the same data!</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>If the list contains a value multiple times, the binary search algorithm can find only one occurrence.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter the temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit) recorded at the same hour each day for the 31 days of January. The Python program must then display a message indicating if there was a possibility of snow, that is, if there were any temperatures below 36 degrees Fahrenheit (about 2 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, you cannot replicate the approach used in the previous exercise. The code fragment that follows would be incorrect.</p>
<div><p>for i in range(DAYS):</p>
<p>if t[i] &lt; 36:</p>

</div>
<p class="my_basic">If January had more than one day with a temperature below 36 degrees Fahrenheit, the same message would be displayed multiple times—and obviously you do not want this! You actually want to display a message once, regardless of whether January had one, two, or even more days below 36 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are two approaches, actually. Let's study them both.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Counting all temperatures below 36 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, you can use a variable in the program to count all the days on which the temperature was below 36 degrees Fahrenheit. After all of the days have been examined, the program can check the value of this variable. If the value is not zero, it means that there was at least one day where there was a possibility of snow.</p>

<div></div>
<p>if count != 0:</p>
<p>print("There was a possibility of snow in January!")</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Using a flag</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, instead of counting all those days that had a temperature below 36 degrees Fahrenheit, you can use a Boolean variable (a flag). The solution is presented next.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_33.6-2b</div>

</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Imagine the variable found as if it's a real flag. Initially, the flag is not hoisted (found = False). Within the for-loop, however, when a temperature below 36 degrees Fahrenheit is found, the flag is hoisted (the value True is assigned to the variable found) and it is never lowered again.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note the break statement! Once a temperature below 36 degrees Fahrenheit is found, it is meaningless to continue checking thereafter.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>If the loop performs all of its iterations and no temperature below 36 degrees Fahrenheit is found, the variable found will still contain its initial value (False) since the flow of execution never entered the decision control structure.</p>

<h4 id="toc_42">Exercise 33.6-3 In Which Cities was There a Possibility of Snow?</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the names of ten cities and their temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit) recorded at the same hour each day for the 31 days of January. The Python program must display the names of the cities in which there was a possibility of snow, that is, those in which temperatures were below 36 degrees Fahrenheit (about 2 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">As in the previous exercise, you need to display each city name once, regardless of whether it had one, two, or even more days below 36 degrees Fahrenheit. There are two approaches. In the first approach, the auxiliary list count, as presented below, is created by the program to count the total number of days on which each city had temperatures lower than 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The second approach, however, doesn't create the auxiliary list count. It uses just one extra Boolean variable (a flag). Obviously the second one is more efficient. But let's study both approaches.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width44" src="img/chapter33-45.png"/></p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Using an auxiliary list</p>
<p class="my_basic">You were taught in <a href="chapter32.html#toc_2">Section 32.2</a> how to process each row individually. The nested loop control structure that can create the auxiliary list count is as follows.</p>
<div><p>count = [None] * CITIES</p>
<p>for i in range(CITIES):</p>
<p>count[i] = 0</p>
<p>for j in range(DAYS):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>if t[i][j] &lt; 36:</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>count[i] += 1</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">After list count is created you can iterate through it, and when an element contains a value other than zero, it means that the corresponding city had at least one day below 36 degrees Fahrenheit; thus the program must display the name of that city.

<p>for j in range(DAYS):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>t[i][j] = int(input("Enter a temperature for day No: " + str(j + 1) + ": "))</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>#Create auxiliary list count</p>
<p>count = [None] * CITIES</p>
<p>for i in range(CITIES):</p>
<p>count[i] = 0</p>
<p>for j in range(DAYS):</p>

<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>count[i] += 1</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div></div>

<p>for i in range(CITIES):</p>
<p>if count[i] != 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>print(names[i])</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Using a flag</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach does not use an auxiliary list. It processes list t and directly displays any city name that had a temperature below 36 degrees Fahrenheit. But how can this be done without displaying a city name twice, or even more than twice? This is where you need a flag, that is, an extra Boolean variable.</p>
<p class="my_basic">To better understand this approach, let's use the “from inner to outer” method. The following code fragment checks if the first row of list t (row index 0) contains at least one temperature below 36 degrees Fahrenheit; if so, it displays the corresponding city name that exists at position 0 of the list names. Assume variable i contains the value 0.</p>
<div><p>found = False</p>
<p>for j in range(DAYS):</p>
<p>if t[i][j] &lt; 36:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>break</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>if found:</p>
<p>print(names[i])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now that everything has been clarified, in order to process the whole list t, you can just nest this code fragment in a for-loop that iterates for all cities, as follows.</p>
<div><p>for i in range(CITIES):</p>
<p>found = False</p>
<p>for j in range(DAYS):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>if t[i][j] &lt; 36:</p></blockquote></div>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">There are 10 students and each one of them has received their grades for five lessons. Write a Python program that prompts a teacher to enter the name of each student and their grades for all lessons. The program must then calculate each student's average grade, and display the names and the average grades of the students sorted by their average grade in descending order. Moreover, if two or more students have the same average grade, their names must be displayed in alphabetical order. Use the bubble sort algorithm, adapted accordingly.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, you need the following three lists. The values for the lists names and grades will be entered by the user, whereas the auxiliary list average will be created by the Python program.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">In archery at the Summer Olympics, 20 athletes each shoot six arrows. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the name of each athlete, and the points awarded for each shot. The program must then display the names of the three athletes that won the gold, silver, and bronze medals depending on which athlete obtained the highest sum of points. Assume that no two athletes have an equal sum of points.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, you need the following three lists. The values for the lists names and points will be entered by the user, whereas the auxiliary list total will be created by the Python program.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width38" src="img/chapter33-47.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">After the auxiliary list total is created, a sorting algorithm can sort the list total in descending order (while preserving the one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the list names). The Python program can then display the names of the three athletes at index positions 0, 1, and 2 (since these are the athletes that should win the gold, the silver, and the bronze medals, respectively).</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following program uses the bubble sort algorithm to sort the list total. Since the algorithm must sort in descending order, bigger elements must gradually “bubble” to positions of lowest index, like bubbles rise in a glass of cola. However, instead of performing 19 passes (there are 20 athletes), given that only the three best athletes must be found, the algorithm can perform just 3 passes. Doing this, only the first three bigger elements will gradually “bubble” to the first three positions in the list.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the names of the 32 national teams of the FIFA World Cup, the names of the 24 players for each team, and the total number of goals each player scored. The program must then display the name of each team along with its five best scorers. Use the bubble sort algorithm.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise you need the following three lists.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width38" src="img/chapter33-48.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>To save paper short list names are used, but it is more or less obvious that list t holds the names of the 32 national teams, list p holds the names of the 24 players of each team, and list g holds the total number of goals each player scored.</p>

<p class="my_basic">The Python program must sort each row of list g in descending order but it must also take care to preserve the one-to-one correspondence with the elements of list p. This means that, every time the bubble sort algorithm swaps the contents of two elements of list g, the corresponding elements of list p must be swapped as well. However, instead of performing 23 passes (there are 24 players), given that only the five best scorers must be found, the algorithm can perform just 5 passes.

<h4 id="toc_46">Exercise 33.6-7 Counting the Frequency of Vowels</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter an English sentence and counts the frequency of each vowel in the sentence. Use a dictionary to store the vowels as keys and their frequencies as values.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In the realm of programming, the manipulation and analysis of textual data play a crucial role. One common task involves counting the frequency of specific elements within a given text, providing insights into its linguistic characteristics. Vowels are fundamental components of the English language, and analyzing their frequency can reveal patterns, aid in language processing, and even assist in certain cryptographic algorithms.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In the solution that follows, the program starts by creating a dictionary named vowelsFrequency to store and manage the frequency of each vowel (A, E, I, O, U), with initial frequencies all set to zero. For each character in the user-provided sentence, the program checks if it is a vowel and, if it is, the corresponding frequency count in the dictionary is updated.</p>

<p>5)In the bubble sort algorithm, when the decision control structure tests the Boolean expression A[n] &gt; A[n − 1], it means that the elements of list A are being sorted in descending order.</p>
<p>6)In Python, sorting algorithms compare letters in the same way that they compare numbers.</p>
<p>7)If you want to sort a list A but preserve the one-to-one correspondence with the elements of a list B, you must rearrange the elements of list B as well.</p>
<p>8)The bubble sort algorithm sometimes performs better than the modified bubble sort algorithm.</p>

<p>35)When using search algorithms, if a list contains unique values and the element that you are looking for is found, there is no need to check any further.</p>
<p>36)The main disadvantage of the binary search algorithm is that data needs to be sorted.</p>
<p>37)The binary search algorithm can be used only in lists that contain arithmetic values.</p>
<p>38)If the element you are looking for is in the last position of a list, a linear search algorithm that starts searching from the beginning of the list will examine all the elements in the list .</p>

<p>14)On Earth, a free-falling object has an acceleration of 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> downward. This value is denoted by g. A student wants to calculate that value using an experiment. She allows 10 different objects to fall downward from a known height, and measures the time they need to reach the floor.

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the name of each team and the letter “W” for win, “L” for loss, or “T” for tie (draw) for each game. Then the program must prompt the user for a letter (W, L, or T) and display, for each team, the week number(s) in which the team won, lost, or tied respectively. For example, if the user enters “L”, the Python program must search and display, for each team, the week numbers (e.g., Week 3, Week 14, and so on) in which the team lost the game.</p>
<p>31)Ten teams participate in a football tournament, and each team plays 16 games, one game each week. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the name of each team, the number of goals the team scored, and the number of goals the team let in for each match. A win receives 3 points and a tie receives 1 point. The Python program must then prompt the user for a team name and finally calculate and display the total number of points for this team. If the user-provided team name is not found, the message “This team does not exist” must be displayed.</p>

If the user-provided value is not found, the message “This value does not exist” must be displayed.</p>
<p>35)There are 12 students and each one of them has received their grades for six lessons. Write a Python program that lets the user enter the grades for all lessons and then displays a message indicating whether or not there is at least one student that has an average value below 70.

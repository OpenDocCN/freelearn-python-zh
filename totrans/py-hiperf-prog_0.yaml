- en: Python is a programming language renowned for its simplicity, elegance, and
    the support of an outstanding community. Thanks to the impressive amount of high-quality
    third-party libraries, Python is used in many domains.

- en: Low-level languages such as C, C++, and Fortran are usually preferred in performance-critical
    applications. Programs written in those languages perform extremely well, but
    are hard to write and maintain.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is an easier language to deal with and it can be used to quickly write
    complex applications. Thanks to its tight integration with C, Python is able to
    avoid the performance drop associated with dynamic languages. You can use blazing
    fast C extensions for performance-critical code and retain all the convenience
    of Python for the rest of your application.

    with examples. This book also addresses common mistakes and teaches how to avoid
    them. The tools used in this book are quite popular and battle-tested; you can
    be sure that they will stay relevant and well-supported in the future.

    and Profiling* shows you how to find the parts of your program that need optimization.
    We will use tools for different use cases and explain how to analyze and interpret
    profiling statistics.'

    Array Operations with NumPy* is a guide to the NumPy package. NumPy is a framework
    for array calculations in Python. It comes with a clean and concise API, and efficient
    array operations.'

    with Cython* is a tutorial on Cython: a language that acts as a bridge between
    Python and C. Cython can be used to write code using a superset of the Python
    syntax and to compile it to obtain efficient C extensions.'

    is an introduction to parallel programming. In this chapter, you will learn how
    parallel programming is different from serial programming and how to parallelize
    simple problems. We will also explain how to use multiprocessing, `IPython.parallel`
    and `cython.parallel` to write code for multiple cores.'

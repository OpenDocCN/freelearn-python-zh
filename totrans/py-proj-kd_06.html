So far, though, you have not yet learned what to do with data. We have not created nor stored data. Yet, we know that video games store data! Video games sometimes store the names of players as well as the highest score that a player has achieved. How does one computer program remember all of this information? In this chapter, you will learn about some ways that Python can store and retrieve data, such as lists and dictionaries.</p><p>For the exercises and code in this chapter, your Python shell will be the best tool to use so that you can type your lists and dictionaries and then check the outcome of your coding. Otherwise, once your prompt is available, you can type lists and dictionaries, your shell will remember the information that you enter, and then you can test how to retrieve, add, and remove information.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note14"/>Note</h3><p>If you shut down your Python shell at any time during this chapter, all of your work will be lost. The Python shell does not remember information between sessions, so lists and dictionaries will not be saved.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec38"/>Lists</h1></div></div></div><p>Lists have many different <a id="id181" class="indexterm"/>uses when coding, and many different operations can be performed on lists, thanks to Python. In this chapter, you will only learn about some of the many uses of lists.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note15"/>Note</h3><p>If you wish to learn more about lists, the Python documentation is very detailed and can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=lists#more-on-lists">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html?highlight=lists#more-on-lists</a>.</p></div></div><p>First, some facts <a id="id182" class="indexterm"/>about Python lists: Python lists are <span class="emphasis"><em>mutable</em></span>. This means that the data in a list can be changed around. Items can be added or removed using functions that act directly on the list. Also, the items in a list can be mixed together. Numbers, floats, and strings can all go together in the same list.</p><div class="section" title="Parts of a list"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec36"/>Parts of a list</h2></div></div></div><p>Lists, like<a id="id183" class="indexterm"/> other kinds of data, are assigned to a variable. Then, the list items are placed in <code class="literal">[ ]</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_11.jpg" alt="Parts of a list"/></div><p>In your Python shell, type the following three lists, one on each line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'dragonfruit']</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>years = [2012,  2013,  2014,  2015]</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>students_in_class = [30,  22,  28,  33]</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_01.jpg" alt="Parts of a list"/></div><p>Each of the lists<a id="id184" class="indexterm"/> you have typed has a particular kind of data inside it. The <code class="literal">fruit</code> list contains strings, the <code class="literal">years</code> list contains integers, and the <code class="literal">students_in_class</code> list also contains integers. However, one feature of lists is that they can mix up datatypes within the same list. For example, I have made this list that combines strings and integers:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>computer_class = ['Cynthia', 78, 42, 'Raj', 98, 24, 35, 'Kadeem', 'Rachel']</strong></span>
</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Working with a list"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec37"/>Working with a list</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that we have<a id="id185" class="indexterm"/> made the lists, we can work with the contents of the list in many ways. In fact, once you create a list, the computer remembers the order of the list, and the order stays constant until it is changed purposefully. The easiest way for us to check whether the order of lists is maintained is to run tests on the <code class="literal">fruit</code>, <code class="literal">years</code>, <code class="literal">students_in_class</code>, and <code class="literal">computer_class</code> lists that we have already made.</p><p>The first item of a Python list is always counted as <span class="strong"><strong>0</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>zero</strong></span>). So, for our first test, let's check whether asking for item <code class="literal">0</code> actually gives us the first item we entered in the list. Using our <code class="literal">fruit</code> list, we will type the name of the list inside a <code class="literal">print</code> statement, and then add square brackets <code class="literal">[]</code> with the number <code class="literal">0</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  print(fruit[0])</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Your output should be <code class="literal">apple</code> since apple is the first fruit in the list we created earlier:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_02.jpg" alt="Working with a list"/></div><p>Now, we have evidence that counting in Python does start with <code class="literal">0</code> and also that our list is written correctly. Next, we can try to print the fourth item in the <code class="literal">fruit</code> list. You will notice that we are<a id="id186" class="indexterm"/> entering <code class="literal">3</code> in our <code class="literal">print</code> command. This is because the first item started at <code class="literal">0</code>. Type this code into your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  print(fruit[3])</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>What is your outcome? Did you expect <code class="literal">dragonfruit</code> to be the answer? If so, good, you are learning to count items in lists. If not, remember that the first item in a list is item <code class="literal">0</code>. With practice, you will become better at counting items in short Python lists:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_03.jpg" alt="Working with a list"/></div><p>For extra practice, work with the other lists that we made earlier, and try printing different items<a id="id187" class="indexterm"/> from these lists using this code sample:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_12.jpg" alt="Working with a list"/></div><p>Where the code says <code class="literal">list_name</code>, write the name of the list you want to use. Where the code says <code class="literal">item_number</code>, write the number of the item you want to print. Remember that lists begin counting at <code class="literal">0</code>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Changing the list – adding and removing information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec38"/>Changing the list – adding and removing information</h2></div></div></div><p>Even though<a id="id188" class="indexterm"/> lists keep their order, they can be changed. Items can be added to a list, removed from them, or changed in them. Again, there are many ways to interact with lists. We will only<a id="id189" class="indexterm"/> discuss a few here, but you can always read the<a id="id190" class="indexterm"/> Python documentation for more information.</p><div class="section" title="Adding items to the list"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec22"/>Adding items to the list</h3></div></div></div><p>To add an item<a id="id191" class="indexterm"/> to our <code class="literal">fruit</code> list, for example, we can use a method called <code class="literal">list.append()</code>. To use this method, type the name of the list, a dot, the method name <code class="literal">append</code>, and then <a id="id192" class="indexterm"/>parentheses with the item you would like to add inside. If the item is a string, remember to use single quotes. Type the following code to add <code class="literal">orange</code> to the list of fruits we have made:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    fruit.append('orange')</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Then, print the list of fruit to check whether <code class="literal">orange</code> has been added to the list:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    print(fruit)</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_04.jpg" alt="Adding items to the list"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Removing items from the list"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec23"/>Removing items from the list</h3></div></div></div><p>Now, let's say that <a id="id193" class="indexterm"/>we no longer want <code class="literal">dragonfruit</code> to appear on our list. We will use a method called <code class="literal">list.remove()</code>. To do this, we will type the name of our list, a dot, the <code class="literal">remove</code> method<a id="id194" class="indexterm"/> name , and the name of the item that we wish to remove:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    fruit.remove('dragonfruit')</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Then, print the list, confirm that <code class="literal">dragonfruit</code> has been removed:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    print(fruit)</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_05.jpg" alt="Removing items from the list"/></div><p>If you have more than one of the same item in the list, <code class="literal">list.remove()</code> will only remove the first instance of that item. The other items with the same name need to be removed separately.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Lists and loops"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec39"/>Lists and loops</h2></div></div></div><p>Lists and <code class="literal">for</code><a id="id195" class="indexterm"/> loops work very well together. With lists, we can do something called an <span class="strong"><strong>iteration</strong></span>. By itself, the word <span class="emphasis"><em>iteration</em></span> means repeating a process. We know that <code class="literal">for</code> loops repeat<a id="id196" class="indexterm"/> things for a limited and specific number of times. So, we can use <code class="literal">for</code> loops to iterate over lists of items.</p><p>In this sample, we have<a id="id197" class="indexterm"/> three colors in our list. Make this list in your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>colors = ['green', 'yellow', 'red']</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Using our list, we may decide that for each color in the list, we want to print the statement <code class="literal">I see</code> and add each color in our list. By using the <code class="literal">for</code> loop with the colors list, we can type the <code class="literal">print</code> statement once and three sentences will be returned. Type the following <code class="literal">for</code> loop in your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  for color in colors:</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>       print('I see  ' + color  +  '.')</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>You will notice that, in the second line of code, we add the strings together using the plus sign operator (<code class="literal">+</code>). The first string, <code class="literal">I see</code>, starts each sentence. The second string, <code class="literal">color</code>, comes from the variable that we made when we wrote the <code class="literal">for</code> loop. The third string is a period (<code class="literal">.</code>) to end the sentence. Once you are done typing the print line and you press <span class="emphasis"><em>Enter</em></span> twice, your <code class="literal">for</code> loop will start running, and you should see the following statements printed in your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  I see green.</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  I see yellow.</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  I see red.</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Notice that the sentences print the colors in the order that they appear in the list. Order is preserved in lists:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_06.jpg" alt="Lists and loops"/></div><p>As you can imagine, lists and <code class="literal">for</code> loops are very powerful when used together. Instead of having to type the<a id="id198" class="indexterm"/> line three times with three different pieces of code, we only had to type two lines of code.</p><p>Our <code class="literal">for</code> loop, with only those two lines of code, would work if there were twenty colors or even two <a id="id199" class="indexterm"/>hundred colors in the list. We will explore the power of using lists more in the next chapter and mini-game.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Dictionaries"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec39"/>Dictionaries</h1></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Dictionaries</strong></span> are a different <a id="id200" class="indexterm"/>way to organize data. At first glance, a dictionary may look just like a list. However, dictionaries have different jobs, rules, and different syntax than lists.</p><p>Parts of a dictionary like lists, dictionaries have different parts that need to be used to make them work—names, use curly braces to store information. For example, if we wanted to make a dictionary called <code class="literal">numbers</code>, we would put the dictionary entries inside curly braces. Here is a simple example to type into your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>numbers = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_13.jpg" alt="Dictionaries"/></div><div class="section" title="Key/value pairs in dictionaries"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec40"/>Key/value pairs in dictionaries</h2></div></div></div><p>As you can see in the<a id="id201" class="indexterm"/> previous screenshot, the dictionary stores information with things called <span class="strong"><strong>keys</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>values</strong></span>. In a<a id="id202" class="indexterm"/> dictionary of items, for example, we might have keys that tell us the names of each item and values that tell us how many of each item we have in our inventory. Once we store these items in our dictionary, we can add or remove new items (keys), add <a id="id203" class="indexterm"/>new amounts (values), or change the amounts of existing items. If you have ever used a contact list in your e-mail or a smartphone, you might recognize that it <a id="id204" class="indexterm"/>matches a key (the person's name) with a value (their e-mail ID or phone number). Keys and values do not always have to be in the form of strings and integers, but for our next example, we will use a dictionary to store all the items that a video game hero might have on a quest.</p><p>The following is an example of a dictionary that can hold some information for a game. Let's suppose that the hero in our game has some items that are needed to survive. Here is a dictionary of our hero's items; type this dictionary of items into your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>items = {'arrows' : 200, 'rocks' : 25, 'food' : 15, 'lives' : 2}</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Now we have a dictionary that gives us information about the items that our hero has. Unlike a list, a dictionary does not keep items in the order that they were entered. You can see this by printing out a small dictionary a few times and noticing the results. To print a dictionary, we type <code class="literal">print</code>, and then we place the name of the dictionary in the print statement:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>print(items)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>You will notice that the output of the code results in the dictionary being printed in a different order from how you entered it. There is a possibility that it might print the same order, but it is more likely to print differently than how you entered it. Take a look at this screenshot for an example:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_14.jpg" alt="Key/value pairs in dictionaries"/></div><p>So, our dictionary has keys such as <code class="literal">arrows</code>, <code class="literal">rocks</code>, <code class="literal">food</code>, and <code class="literal">lives</code>. Each of the numbers that is <a id="id205" class="indexterm"/>stored as a value tells us the number of items that our hero has. To find out the value of a<a id="id206" class="indexterm"/> key, we use a <code class="literal">print</code> statement that contains the <code class="literal">items</code> dictionary name with the <code class="literal">arrows</code> key . Notice that the <code class="literal">arrows</code> key is placed in square brackets. The syntax is important. Type the following code in your Python shell to return the value of <code class="literal">arrows</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>print(items['arrows'])</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The result of this <code class="literal">print</code> statement should output <code class="literal">200</code> as this is the number of arrows our hero has in their inventory:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_07.jpg" alt="Key/value pairs in dictionaries"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Changing the dictionary – adding and removing information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec41"/>Changing the dictionary – adding and removing information</h2></div></div></div><p>Python has several<a id="id207" class="indexterm"/> ways of interacting with dictionary data. There are many functions that we can use. For now, we will focus on those functions that <a id="id208" class="indexterm"/>allow us to add and remove things from our <a id="id209" class="indexterm"/>dictionaries.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note16"/>Note</h3><p>To learn about all<a id="id210" class="indexterm"/> the dictionary methods, visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm</a>.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Adding items to the dictionary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec24"/>Adding items to the dictionary</h3></div></div></div><p>Consider a <a id="id211" class="indexterm"/>situation where, in our game, we allow the player to discover and collect fireballs later in the game. To add an item to the dictionary, we will use what is called<a id="id212" class="indexterm"/> the <span class="strong"><strong>subscript</strong></span> method to add a new key and new value to our dictionary.</p><p>To create a subscript, we will use the name of the dictionary. Then, in square brackets, we write the name of the item (key) that we wish to add. The item is a string type, so it needs to be in single quotes. Finally, we will set the value to how many of the item (key) that we want to put into our dictionary. To add fireballs to your dictionary, copy the following code in your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  items['fireball'] = 10</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>If we print the entire dictionary of items, you will see that the <code class="literal">fireball</code> has been added. Type this code in your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  print(items)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Your outcome should include the <code class="literal">fireball</code> as one of the items. Remember, however, that your code may not be in the same order as the code in this book because dictionaries do not remember orders:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_08.jpg" alt="Adding items to the dictionary"/></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Changing the value of an existing item"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec42"/>Changing the value of an existing item</h2></div></div></div><p>We can also change the value of the keys in our dictionary. Suppose, for example, that our hero is <a id="id213" class="indexterm"/>collecting rocks in the game and then loses the rocks because they use them to build a rock wall. How would our game keep track of each rock added to or removed from the game inventory?</p><p>The <code class="literal">dict.update()</code> method allows us to alter the values of keys in the dictionary. For our dictionary, we will be changing the value of rocks as our hero collects or uses the rocks. To use <code class="literal">dict.update()</code>, we replace <code class="literal">dict</code> with the name of our dictionary, which is <code class="literal">items</code>. Then, in <code class="literal">()</code>, we use <code class="literal">{}</code> to type the name of the item whose value we wish to update.</p><p>We use a colon (<code class="literal">:</code>) and then write the new number of items that we want to see in the dictionary. Try this in your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  items.update({'rocks':10})</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  print(items)</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_09.jpg" alt="Changing the value of an existing item"/></div><p>You will notice <a id="id214" class="indexterm"/>that if you have performed the <code class="literal">print(items)</code> function, you will now have <code class="literal">10</code> rocks instead of <code class="literal">25</code>. We have now successfully updated our number of items.</p><div class="section" title="Removing items from the dictionary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl3sec25"/>Removing items from the dictionary</h3></div></div></div><p>To remove something from<a id="id215" class="indexterm"/> a dictionary, you must reference the key or the name of the item, and then delete the item. By doing so, the value that goes with the item will also be removed since the key and value are paired.</p><p>In Python, the <code class="literal">del</code> statement can be used to remove a key/value pair from the dictionary. This means using <code class="literal">del</code> along with the name of the dictionary and the name of the item (key) that you wish to remove.</p><p>Let's use the items dictionary as our example. We will use the <code class="literal">del</code> statement, the name of the <code class="literal">items</code> dictionary, and the name of the <code class="literal">lives</code> key that's placed inside of the square brackets. Hence, we can use a <code class="literal">print</code> statement to test and check whether the <code class="literal">lives</code> key was removed along with the value of <code class="literal">lives</code>, which is <code class="literal">2</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  del items['lives']</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  print(items)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>If your <code class="literal">del</code> statement worked, the <code class="literal">lives</code> key is no longer in the dictionary and neither is the number of <code class="literal">lives</code>, which was <code class="literal">2</code>. This is similar to taking a word out of a printed dictionary. If you removed the word, you would need to remove the definition as well. The items list will now look like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_06_10.jpg" alt="Removing items from the dictionary"/></div><p>With dictionaries, information is stored and retrieved differently than in lists, but we can still perform the<a id="id216" class="indexterm"/> same operations of adding and removing information as well as making changes to the information.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="List or dictionary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec40"/>List or dictionary</h1></div></div></div><p>You have learned about two great Python data structures, lists and dictionaries. Now, we need to know when to use<a id="id217" class="indexterm"/> these tools. While both tools store information, they do so in very different ways. Let's compare these two structures so that we can better understand how each structure can be used.</p><p>Lists are good to use<a id="id218" class="indexterm"/> when we want to keep track of items and need to remember the order of those items. We use a lot of lists in everyday life that meet these criteria.</p><p>Some examples<a id="id219" class="indexterm"/> of lists are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A grocery list with different food items</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A list of song titles in an MP3 player</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A list of fiction book titles that are available in a library</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A list of items that are available for purchase on a website</li></ul></div><p>Each of these things has an order as a desirable characteristic, and items can be added or removed from the lists. If we wanted to write a short program in Python to keep track of our fiction book titles or find songs in an MP3 playlist, a list might be a good place to start.</p><p>Lists can be used with loops to do a lot of powerful things. Some of these include making lists that create themselves using loops (yes, really) or making lists from lots of user input. Lists are slower to search because they're automatically searched from the beginning.</p><p>A dictionary is more useful when data does not need order but needs to be paired with something else. For example, perhaps you own fiction and nonfiction books, and you want to write a program that stores the title, author, and the genre. Using a dictionary would be better for this<a id="id220" class="indexterm"/> task so that you can quickly figure out the author of a book based on its title or for all the fiction books that you own. You can also interact with your dictionary to make changes. Also, dictionaries can be searched very quickly because they do not need to be searched from the beginning.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note17"/>Note</h3><p>An example of a dictionary<a id="id221" class="indexterm"/> that is used in programming is a <span class="emphasis"><em>Thesaurus</em></span>.

You also tried to perform some basic operations with lists and dictionaries, including how to add and remove data. Finally, you learned the syntax differences between lists and dictionaries as well as the optimal uses of lists and dictionaries.</p><p>In the next chapter, we are going to move forward and make a game called <span class="emphasis"><em>What's in my backpack?</em></span> This game will be a simple, two-player game that will ask both users to put some objects into a backpack and then allow each user to guess what is in the other user's backpack.</p><p>We will write code to add items to a list, keep track of usernames, items, and scores in a list and dictionary, and then use a <code class="literal">for</code> loop to keep track of the game. There are a lot of moving parts in our next game, and it will be a lot of fun to make something that has two players! Are you ready? Let's go!</p></div></body></html>

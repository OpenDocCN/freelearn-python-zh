    small part of what it takes to work with robots. If you want to become really
    good at robotics, you''ll need skills in other areas as well: electromechanics,
    robot simulation, autonomous navigation, and machine learning/reinforcement learning.
    Each of these four topics is a building block that you will need to master on
    your path to acquiring full robotics skills. This book is divided into four parts,
    each one being devoted to each of these building blocks.'

- en: Part 1, *Physical Robot Assembly and Testing*, focuses on electromechanics and
    describes each hardware part of the robot, providing practical demonstrations
    of how to test every sensor and actuator that it is equipped with. This part of
    the book should provide you with a good understanding of how a mobile robot works.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Part 2, *Robot Simulation with Gazebo*, deals with robot simulation. It is here
    where we introduce ROS and develop a two-wheeled robot simulation that emulates
    both the physical aspects and the behavior of an actual robot. We will explore
    the concept of the digital twin, a virtual robot that is the twin of a physical
    one. This is a fundamental part of developing robotic applications, as it cuts
    the costs associated with testing real hardware. The digital twin allows us to
    speed up the development process and save testing with the physical robot for
    the advanced stages of development.

- en: Part 3, *Autonomous Navigation Using SLAM*, is devoted to **r****obot navigation**,
    the most common task for mobile robots. State-of-the-art algorithms and techniques
    are explained in a practical manner, first in simulation and then with a physical
    robot.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Part 4, *Adaptive Robot Behavior Using Machine Learning*, focuses on **machine
    learning** and **reinforcement learning**, the most active fields in robot research
    and real-world robotic applications. By using this technology, a robot is able
    to transition from pure automatism – where every possible behavior or answer is
    coded – to being a flexible behavior machine, where the robot is capable of reacting
    in a smart way to environmental demands by learning from data. This data can be
    obtained from the robot's previous experience or gathered from the experience
    of similar robots.

- en: To build a state-of-the-art robot application, you will first need to master
    and then combine these four building blocks. The result will be what is commonly
    known as a **smart robot**. This is your task – this is your challenge.

    provides the key concepts and the practical assembly guidelines about the mobile
    robot on which all the content in this book is based. With a very practical approach
    in mind, we dive deep into the characteristics of GoPiGo3 that makes it an ideal
    and cost-effective platform to learn robotics. By completing the GoPiGo3 assembly,
    you will have acquired the first manual skills necessary for manipulating typical
    components in robotics. To purchase GoPiGo3 kit, you can visit [https://www.dexterindustries.com/gopigo3/](https://www.dexterindustries.com/gopigo3/) and

    provides you with a practical insight into how GoPiGo3 works. We do so by introducing
    the JupyterLab environment, a friendly interface that takes the structure of a
    notebook composed of human-readable paragraphs followed by Python code snippets.
    You will produce two versions of each test program: the JupyterLab notebook and
    the pure Python script. Using these programming tools, you will test each sensor/actuator
    individually and check that it''s working properly, as well as gain an understanding
    of the technology behind.'

    easy-to-understand language, avoiding very technical descriptions. This is because
    our primary goal is to show you exactly what ROS is in a conceptual sense. It
    will be in the following chapters that deep technical descriptions are provided
    so that you are finally able to integrate ROS into your projects.'

    twin of GoPiGo3\. The model is written in the **Unified Robot Description Format**
    (**URDF**) and the result is checked with RViz, an ROS tool that provides a configurable
    **Graphical User Interface** (**GUI**) to allow the user to display the specific

    patterns in ROS, including the publish-subscribe model. To deal with all of your

    the many details and practical questions that arise when you face a robotic task

    and shows that GoPiGo3 not only perceives things but can also take steps to achieve
    a goal. Our robot will have to decide what action to execute at every step of
    the simulation to achieve the goal. After executing each action, the robot will
    be provided with feedback on how good the decision it made was in the form of
    a reward. After some training, the incentive of the reward will enforce and reinforce

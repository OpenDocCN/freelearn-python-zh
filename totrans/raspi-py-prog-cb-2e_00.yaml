- en: Since the release of the Raspberry Pi computer in February 2012, millions of
    people have been introduced to a new way of computing. Modern home computers,
    tablets, and phones are typically focused on providing content to the user to
    consume, either as a passive viewer or through basic interaction via games and
    activities.

- en: However, the Raspberry Pi turns this concept on its head. The idea is that the
    user provides the input and the imagination, and the Raspberry Pi becomes an extension
    of their creativity. The Raspberry Pi provides a simple, low-cost platform that
    you can use to experiment with and play with your own ideas. It won't feed you
    information; it will let you discover it firsthand.

- en: This book focuses on using the Raspberry Pi with Python 3; therefore, a basic
    Raspberry Pi setup is required. Chapters 1 to 5 of this book make use of the Raspberry
    Pi only; no additional hardware is required beyond a standard setup.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard setup will consist of a Raspberry Pi (Model A or Model B, Version
    1, 2 or 3); an SD card installed with Raspbian; a suitable micro USB power supply;
    and an HDMI-compatible screen, keyboard, and mouse. You will also be required
    to download and install various software packages; therefore, the Raspberry Pi
    should have a working internet connection.

- en: This book encourages you to experiment and connect your own circuits to the
    general-purpose input/output Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. This is an excellent way
    to learn about electronics and software at the same time. However, it is important
    to remember that the GPIO pins are unprotected, and if wired incorrectly, can
    easily be damaged or even cause the Raspberry Pi to stop working altogether. Therefore,
    care should be taken to correctly follow the instructions and wiring diagrams
    and check everything carefully before switching the Raspberry Pi on.

    as demonstration examples only. They have not been tested for extended use and
    should not be left unattended or should not be used in safety-critical applications
    without adequate safeguards in place. Remember that all electronics must undergo
    rigorous safety testing to ensure that in the event of failure, there will be
    no risk of harm to people or property.

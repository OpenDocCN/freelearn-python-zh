- en: Mobile devices have transformed the way applications are perceived. They have
    increased in interaction types; the user now expects gestures, multi-touches,
    animations, responsiveness, virtual keyboards, and magic-pens. Moreover, compatibility
    has become a must if you want to avoid the barriers imposed by major operating
    systems. Kivy is an open source Python solution that covers these market needs
    with an easy-to-learn and rapid development approach. Kivy continues to grow fast
    and two versions have been released since the first publication of this book in
    September 2013\. Thanks to an enthusiastic community, Kivy is making its way in
    an extremely competitive territory in which it stands out for offering both a
    cross-platform and efficient alternative to native development and HTML5.

- en: This book introduces you to the Kivy world, covering a large variety of important
    topics related to interactive applications and games development. The components
    presented in this book were selected according to their usefulness for developing
    state-of-art applications and also for serving as an example of broader Kivy functionalities.
    Following this approach, the book covers a big part of the Kivy library.

    the three projects that come with this book. The first one, the comic creator,
    exemplifies how to build a user interface ([Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. GUI
    Basics – Building an Interface"), *GUI Basics – Building an Interface*), how to
    draw vector shapes in the screen ([Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Graphics –
    the Canvas"), *Graphics – the Canvas*), how to bind user interactions with pieces
    codes ([Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Widget Events – Binding Actions"), *Widget
    Events – Binding Actions*), and other components related to improving the user
    experience ([Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Improving the User Experience"),
    *Improving the User Experience*). The second project, Invaders Revenge, is an
    interactive game that introduces you to the use of animations, scheduling of tasks,
    keyboard events, and multi-touch control ([Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Invaders
    Revenge – an Interactive Multi-touch Game"), *Invaders Revenge – an Interactive
    Multi-touch Game*). The third project, Kivy Player, teaches how we can control
    video streams with a modern design and responsive interactions to maximize the
    use of the screen ([Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Kivy Player – a TED Video
    Streamer"), *Kivy Player – a TED Video Streamer*).

- en: Occasionally, this book explains some technical but important Kivy concepts
    that are related to the Kivy class structure and implementation, or the order
    and strategies to draw on the screen. These explanations give the reader some
    insights into the Kivy internals that will help them solve potential problems
    when they develop their own projects. Even though they are not necessary for the
    comprehension of the main topics of this book, they will become important lessons
    when the reader faces new situations implementing their own applications.

- en: This book grabs the reader's attention by stating interesting programming scenarios.
    The sections are generally short and straightforward, making the learning process
    constant. These short sections will also serve as a reference when the reader
    finishes the book. However, serving as a reference doesn't prevent the text from
    achieving the main goal, which is teaching bigger projects that connect the small
    topics. At the end of this book, the reader will feel comfortable to start their
    own project.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You need to have some programming experience before starting this book and specifically
    have a good understanding of some software engineering concepts, particularly
    inheritance and the difference between classes and instances. You should be already
    familiar with Python. That said, the code is kept as simple as possible and it
    avoids the use of very specific Python nuances, so any other developer can follow
    it. No previous experience of Kivy is required, though some general programming
    knowledge of event handling, scheduling, and user interfaces would boost your
    learning. You also need to have Kivy 1.9.0 installed with all its requirements.
    The installation instructions can be found at [http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/installation.html](http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/installation.html).

    UI/UX applications for different platforms. This book will also benefit developers
    that are seeking for an alternative to HTML5 or native Android/iOS development,
    looking forward to learn about mobile development and its demands (multi-touch,
    gestures, and animations), or wishing to improve their understanding of object-oriented
    topics such as inheritance, classes and instances, and event handling.

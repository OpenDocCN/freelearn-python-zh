    you through the process of developing real-world graphical applications using
    Python and Tkinter, the built-in GUI module of Python.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book attempts to highlight the features and capabilities of Tkinter while
    demonstrating best practices involved in writing GUI programs, irrespective of
    the library that you choose to build your application with. Here, you will learn
    how to use Tkinter to develop exciting, fun, and useful GUI applications with
    Tkinter and Python.

- en: We hope to take you on a fun journey through more than 10 projects from different
    problem domains. As we develop new applications in each project, the book also
    builds up a catalog of some commonly used strategies to develop real-world applications.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Software developers, scientists, researchers, engineers, students, and programming
    hobbyists with basic familiarity with Python will find this book interesting and
    informative. A motivated Python newbie with a background in writing programs can
    fill in the gaps of knowledge with a little outside research.

    from scratch, providing an overview of Tkinter and covering details of how to
    create root windows, add widgets to a root window, handle layout with geometry
    managers, and work with events.'

    develops a text editor using the procedural style of programming. It gives readers
    their first taste of several features of Tkinter and what it is like to develop
    a real application.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](e107248f-043c-4c95-b5e1-21b9ab99517a.xhtml), *Programmable Drum
    Machine*, uses object-oriented programming to develop a drum machine that is capable
    of playing user-composed rhythms. The application can also save compositions and
    later edit or replay them. Here, you will learn the techniques of designing a
    GUI application using a model-first philosophy and writing multithreaded GUI applications.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](7e561bee-a102-437c-bfdf-018694145027.xhtml), *Game of Chess*, introduces
    the key aspects of structuring a GUI application using the model-view-controller
    (MVC) architecture. It also teaches the art of taking a real-world object (chess)
    and modeling it in the notations that your program can manipulate. In addition,
    it introduces readers to the power of the Tkinter Canvas widget.'

    Player*, covers the concepts of working with external libraries while showing
    you how to work with many different Tkinter widgets. Most importantly, it shows
    how to make your own Tkinter widgets, thereby extending the capabilities of the
    Tkinter manifold.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ea2fc662-7799-456e-b596-abb38f5fadcb.xhtml), *Paint Application*,
    looks at the Tkinter Canvas widget in detail. As you will see, the Canvas widget
    is truly a highlight of Tkinter. The chapter also introduces the concept of the
    GUI framework, thereby creating reusable code for all your future programs.'

    how to represent the given domain information using JSON and then apply the data
    thus created to create an interactive application. It also discusses the concept
    of program responsiveness and how to handle it with Tkinter.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We assume an introductory level familiarity with the basic constructs of Python
    programming language. We use Python version 3.6 with Tkinter 8.6, and it is recommended
    to stick to these exact versions to avoid compatibility issues.

    However, given the multiplatform abilities of Tkinter, you can easily work on
    other platforms such as Windows, Mac OS, and other distributions of Linux. The
    links to download and install other project-specific modules and software are
    mentioned in the respective chapters.

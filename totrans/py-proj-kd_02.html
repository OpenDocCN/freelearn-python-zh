You also learned how to use the <code class="literal">print</code> statement in Python and printed some messages using your Python shell. We are now going to jump into a lot of details so that we can build our first project together. It will include the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Variables</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Variable names</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Strings, integers, and floats</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Functions</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec14"/>Variables</h1></div></div></div><p>A variable is<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> when one letter or word is used to represent a different letter, word, number, or value. One way to think of a variable is to imagine that you are programming a computer so that it can make memories. For example, my name is Jessica. If I am writing a computer program and I want that program to remember my name, I will assign my name to a variable. This will look like <code class="literal">name = 'Jessica'</code>. The variable is <code class="literal">name</code>. <code class="literal">Jessica</code> in the memory.</p><p>Perhaps I would like the computer to remember something else about me as well. Maybe I want the computer program to remember that I am 64 inches, or roughly 128 cm, tall. I will say <code class="literal">height_inches = 64</code> or <code class="literal">height_centimeters = 128</code>. The variables here are <code class="literal">height_inches</code> and <code class="literal">height_centimeters</code>. The memories are my height in inches and my height in centimeters.</p><p>Why don't you try giving a computer the <code class="literal">name</code> variable with your name and then a <code class="literal">height</code> variable with your height?</p><p>First, open your Python shell and type the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>name = 'yourname'</strong>
<strong>height = 'your height'</strong>
</pre></div><p>Now that the variables are stored, you can type <code class="literal">print(name)</code> or <code class="literal">print(height)</code>. Since you created a memory for the computer with your name and your height, the computer will print the memory that you gave it. If you take a look at the screenshot from my Python shell, you <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>will see that the computer printed the memories that I assigned it. Notice that we do not use single quotes around the variable names:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_01.jpg" alt="Variables"/></div><p>If the values, or memories, that you assigned to the variables are printed in your Python terminal, then it is perfect. If not, you may have an error. There are a lot of reasons due to which an error can occur. You may have typed your variable name or your information in a way that breaks the Python convention. Some common errors include using capital letters.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec10"/>Naming variables – conventions to follow</h2></div></div></div><p>There are some <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>conventions that are used to name variables in Python. It might seem silly to have guidelines about naming things, but following the conventions is really important because it helps other people read your code. Also, the Python shell is designed to work with the conventions.</p><p>To avoid errors, your variable names should use lowercase letters. If your variable uses more than one word, such as the <code class="literal">height_inches</code> variable, then it should have underscores to connect the words together.</p><p>If you use two words to name your variable and do not connect them with an underscore, you will get an error. Take a look at the following screenshot and see where it says <code class="literal">SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code>. Notice this error occurred because the <code class="literal">height centimeters</code> variable<a id="id41" class="indexterm"/> did not have an underscore to connect the words:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_02.jpg" alt="Naming variables – conventions to follow"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec11"/>What can variables remember?</h2></div></div></div><p>Python variables can be <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>programmed to remember all kinds of information! You will notice in our original example that we stored a word and then a number. There are three different kinds of information that we will be using to build our calculator in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Calculate This!">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Calculate This</em>!, strings, integers, and floats. Each bit of information is input and output a little differently.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec04"/>Strings</h3></div></div></div><p>In Python, a <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>string is any piece of data that's captured between two single quote marks, that is, these symbols <code class="literal">'</code> <code class="literal">'</code>. Sometimes, double quotation marks are used. For example, I can have a string variable that looks like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>sentence = 'This is a sentence about Python.'</strong>
</pre></div><p>This string variable contains letters and words. Most string variables do. However, you can store a number as a string also as long as that number is in single quotes:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  number_string = '40'</strong>
</pre></div><p>If we can store all kinds of information as strings, why do we need other data types? Well, when we store numbers as strings, we cannot do math with the numbers! Type this problem into your Python shell, and then you will see why we need data types besides strings:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  first_number = '10'</strong>
<strong>  second_number = '20'</strong>
<strong>  print(first_number + second_number)</strong>
</pre></div><p>What happened<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> in your Python shell? You might have expected the printed output to be <code class="literal">30</code> since <code class="literal">10</code> plus <code class="literal">20</code> is equal to <code class="literal">30</code>. However, Python saw each number as a text string and simply put the two text strings next to each other. So, your result was probably <code class="literal">1020</code>. Here is how this looks in the Python shell:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_03.jpg" alt="Strings"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec05"/>Integers</h3></div></div></div><p>Computers are really great at math, and math will allow us to execute more complicated programs, such as games. Python stores whole number data as integers.</p><p>Let's start with integers:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An integer is <a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>simply a plain whole number. If we want to make our variables store integers, we would take away the quotes.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Then, when we add the two variables and print the output, we will get a mathematical result.</li></ul></div><p>Try it out! Let's do some math with these variables:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Type the following two variables in your Python shell:<div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>    first_number = 10</strong>
<strong>    second_number = 20</strong>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Then, print the output by typing <code class="literal">print</code> and the variables:<div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>    print(first_number + second_number)</strong>
</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>After completing step 2, press <em>Enter</em>. Your result should be <code class="literal">30</code>. This is because Python is reading the numbers as integers, and Python understands integers with mathematical operators. In fact, Python understands math so well that you will notice that no equals sign was needed to tell Python to output the answer. Take a look at this screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_04.jpg" alt="Integers"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl3sec06"/>Floating point numbers (floats)</h3></div></div></div><p>Hopefully, you now <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>better understand how Python works with integers (whole numbers). However, people and computers often need to work in fractional numbers. In Python, these numbers are called <strong>floating point numbers</strong>, but many people call them <em>floats</em> as a shortcut:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Floats are actually a really fancy way of saying <em>numbers using decimals</em></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Floats are called this because the decimal point can be anywhere among the numbers, allowing for decimals of many different sizes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting numbers as floats allows us to do more complicated math using fractional numbers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To set a variable to a float, you don't have to do anything special or different from what you did to set the integers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python knows that a number input (a variable, for example) with a decimal point is a float, and Python will output the answers as a float if the problem is clear</li></ul></div><p>In your Python shell, try this math problem using floating point numbers instead of integers:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  first_number = 10.3</strong>
<strong>  second_number = 20.3</strong>
<strong>  print(first_number + second_number)</strong>
</pre></div><p>This time, in your Python shell, you should notice that Python recognized the variable input as floating point numbers and was able to output the complete and correct answer without us having to <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>use additional instructions. The output from your <code class="literal">print</code> statement should be <code class="literal">30.6</code>, as you can see in this screenshot of the Python shell:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_05.jpg" alt="Floating point numbers (floats)"/></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec12"/>Combining strings, integers, and floats</h2></div></div></div><p>So far, we have only attempted to combine items that share a data type. We have added two strings, two<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> integers, or two floats. What happens<a id="id49" class="indexterm"/> when you try to add two different types of information, such as a string and an integer? In your Python shell, type the following lines of code and pay attention to the output:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  first_number = '10'</strong>
<strong>  second_number = 20</strong>
<strong>  print(first_number + second_number)</strong>
</pre></div><p>You are likely to notice the error that you receive. The important line to pay attention to is <code class="literal">TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects</code>. Python is telling us that it cannot work with these two different data types and that makes sense. So, if you do make a mistake in your typing <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>or try to execute an operation in two different data types, you may get<a id="id51" class="indexterm"/> an error like this:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_06.jpg" alt="Combining strings, integers, and floats"/></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Functions</h1></div></div></div><p>Once we have variables, we can use them to do some pretty interesting things. The most interesting thing is to <a id="id52" class="indexterm"/>build functions. Python functions are blocks of code that we can build to do a specific job. We build these functions once, and then we can reuse them in our code just by typing the name. This is really helpful. For example, if I need to write a program that adds two numbers (a calculator, for example), I do not want to have to write three or four lines of code every time I want to add two numbers. Instead, I want to write one function that can add two numbers together, and then use that single line whenever I need to add numbers.</p><p>Before we begin building functions of our own, we need to also know that Python has a lot of amazing functions that are built in. Some of Python's functions are things we will use all the time. Others we won't talk about in this book, but as you become a more skilled programmer, you will learn more about Python's built-in functions.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec13"/>Built-in functions</h2></div></div></div><p>Here's something about<a id="id53" class="indexterm"/> some built-in functions and what they do:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">int()</code>: This converts a string<a id="id54" class="indexterm"/> or a float into an integer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">float()</code>: This <a id="id55" class="indexterm"/>converts a string or an integer into a float</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">raw_input()</code>: This gets information<a id="id56" class="indexterm"/> from a user and stores it in the computer to use later</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">str()</code>: This <a id="id57" class="indexterm"/>converts an integer, float, or other information into a string</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">help()</code>: This provides <a id="id58" class="indexterm"/>access to Python's help</li></ul></div><p>We will be using these<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/> functions to help us build our first project in the next chapter.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>If you are curious about what other functions are built in or if you want to know more, you can go to the Python documents at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html?highlight=built%20functions#">https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html?highlight=built%20functions#</a>.</p><p>Initially, the <a id="id60" class="indexterm"/>documents can seem overwhelming because they are very detailed. The detail can make the documents difficult to understand at times, but the documents are very helpful and are used by many programmers.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"/>Parts of a function</h2></div></div></div><p>There are basic parts to<a id="id61" class="indexterm"/> think about when you want to build your own function. First, here's the basic function to add two numbers:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  def addition():</strong>
<strong>    first_number = 30</strong>
<strong>    second_number = 60</strong>
<strong>    print(first_number + second_number)</strong>
</pre></div><p>The first line of this code is new, so we need to understand what it means:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The first thing to notice is the word <code class="literal">def</code>. In Python, this is short for define, and it is used to define a new function.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The next thing to notice is the name of the function. The name of the function has the same guidelines as the names of variables. A function needs to use lowercase letters, and when it has many words, there need to be underscores between each word.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">After the name of the <code class="literal">addition()</code> function, you will notice the parentheses <code class="literal">()</code>. These are empty in this function, but sometimes they are not empty. Even if they are, the parentheses must <em>ALWAYS</em> be a part of the function that you create.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finally, the first line of the function ends with a colon. The colon (<code class="literal">:</code>), ends the first line of the function.</li></ul></div><p>A function can be short, such as this <code class="literal">addition()</code> function, which is only four lines in total, or it can be really long. Every line after the first line in a Python function needs to be indented using spaces. When we work on building our own functions in the next section of this chapter, you will learn how to make indents in your Python shell. We will also discuss proper spacing in the text editor.</p><p>There are a lot <a id="id62" class="indexterm"/>of new details to remember in order to write a function. What happens if you forget a detail? If you forget to indent a line, Python will let you know and output an error. Your function will not run, and your code will not work. Python's use of indentation is<a id="id63" class="indexterm"/> known as <strong>whitespace</strong>, and there are rules about whitespace use in Python.</p><p>By now, you are very familiar with doing additions in Python, so we will keep working with the addition code. There are special considerations in order to write functions in the Python shell. Because a function is a block of code, we want to follow these guidelines when we are trying to perform functions in the shell:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">After you type the first line and press <em>Enter</em>, make sure you press <em>Tab</em> before you type each line</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">When you have completed typing all the lines, hit <em>Enter</em> twice so that the Python shell knows that you are done creating the function</li></ul></div><p>In your Python shell, type the <code class="literal">addition()</code> function exactly as it appears here:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  def addition():</strong>
<strong>    first_number = 30</strong>
<strong>    second_number = 60</strong>
<strong>    print(first_number + second_number)</strong>
</pre></div><p>Notice how the function looks in the Python shell:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_07.jpg" alt="Parts of a function"/></div><p>Now that you have typed your function, you need to learn how to use the function. To use the function in the Python shell, type the name of the function and the parentheses:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  addition()</strong>
</pre></div><p>Typing the function is also<a id="id64" class="indexterm"/> known as calling the function. When you call the <code class="literal">addition()</code> function in the Python shell and then press <em>Enter</em>, you will get an output as the answer to the problem. Notice how this is displayed here:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_08.jpg" alt="Parts of a function"/></div><p>Compare your result to the results shown in the preceding screenshots. Once you know that your function runs the way you want it to, you can show it to your parents and friends by asking them to look at your code. It is a good idea to test your function by retyping it with different numbers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"/>Users interacting with your program</h1></div></div></div><p>We just built a function that adds two numbers together. Learning to make a program that does math is interesting, but our function is limited because our <code class="literal">addition()</code> function needs to have variables changed manually to calculate results for different numbers.</p><p>What if there <a id="id65" class="indexterm"/>was a way to get information from the user and store <em>THAT</em> information in a variable so that it could be used by addition or subtraction functions each time? Anyone who has used a calculator of any kind already knows that this is possible. Python has a function called <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> that allows us to tell the program to ask the user a question. The <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> function is incredibly useful. We can get every kind of information from the user this way, and we can make interactions between the user and the computer based on the user input.</p><p>We can use the Python shell to test how the <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> function works. Try typing these two lines of code into your Python shell:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  name = raw_input('What is your name?')</strong>
<strong>  print(name)</strong>
</pre></div><p>What happened<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> here? Let's have a look:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What should have happened is that you should have had a prompt in the terminal that asked <code class="literal">'What is your name?'</code> Then, you can type your response.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Following your response, hit <em>Enter</em>. Nothing will happen (nothing should happen yet!).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You have given the computer information (a memory) to store in the <code class="literal">name</code> variable, but now you need to get the information out of the <code class="literal">name</code> variable.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You can get the output of the memory that the user entered by printing the <code class="literal">name</code> variable.</li></ul></div><p>In this screenshot, you can see the entire sequence in the Python shell:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_09.jpg" alt="Users interacting with your program"/></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"/>Using the text editor and the command line</h1></div></div></div><p>So far, we have <a id="id67" class="indexterm"/>used the Python shell to write and test code. The shell is great because we<a id="id68" class="indexterm"/> type a line of code or even a few lines of code, and then we run them immediately to see whether they work. However, you may have noticed that there isn't a way to save any of the code that we write.</p><p>For a program to run, it needs to have all of the code available. Using a text editor is just like writing a report, an email, or a paper: we write our code and save it; then, we go back to edit it if we want to. In order to make Python use and understand our file, we need to use the command line and tell Python to run the file.</p><p>To perform our next task as well as the remaining tasks in the book, we will use our text editor side by side<a id="id69" class="indexterm"/> with our terminal/command prompt. Let's walk through the setup of<a id="id70" class="indexterm"/> the text editor and command line right now.</p><p>The first thing you need to do is as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Make a special folder where you can store your code files, and remember how to find this folder! (Look back at <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Welcome! Let's Get Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Welcome! Let's Get Started</em>, for instructions.)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">This folder, or directory, is very important, as it will be the place where you put the work that you create for the rest of this book</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python needs to be able to access this directory to run all the programs, and soon, we will write files that will use other files; so, all of the files need to live in the same place</li></ul></div><p>Once you are certain that you have a special work folder, you can open the text editor program we set up in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Welcome! Let's Get Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Welcome! Let's Get Started</em>. You will also open a new window in a terminal or in the command prompt.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"/>Build your own function – name()</h1></div></div></div><p>So, you have learned about variables and how they store information. You have also learned about how these variables can be used inside of a function. Finally, you have learned how<a id="id71" class="indexterm"/> to use special Python functions, such as <code class="literal">input()</code>, to help get information from users and store it in the computer. You are ready to build your own function using variables and <code class="literal">input()</code>.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec15"/>Set up your project file</h2></div></div></div><p>The function that we <a id="id72" class="indexterm"/>will build now is called <code class="literal">name()</code>. The purpose of this function will be to ask the user their name, store (remember) the name, and then print out a friendly message to the user.</p><p>To start this function, do the following:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open a new file in your text editor.</li><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Save</strong> and name the file <code class="literal">name.py</code>.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>You need to use <code class="literal">.py</code> at the end of all of your code files so that the files run in the terminal/command prompt. Python only recognizes <code class="literal">.py</code> files.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">Save the file in<a id="id73" class="indexterm"/> the folder you made for all of your Python work.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"/>Begin your project</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you have <a id="id74" class="indexterm"/>set up a project file, the first thing you might want to do is add a short comment to your file. A comment allows humans to quickly understand what is happening in the code. Whenever you are writing something that is not code, you should start the line with a hashtag, or hash. The hash is one way to tell the computer, <em>Ignore this!</em>, yet it allows humans to read the text. Type the following line in your file:</p><p><code class="literal"># This is my first function called name. It will ask the name and # print a message.</code></p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec17"/>Writing code</h2></div></div></div><p>The next line you<a id="id75" class="indexterm"/> type will begin the computer-readable code. First, make sure that there is a space between the comment you wrote and the first line of computer-readable code. As we learned earlier, you will start the function using the Python word <code class="literal">def</code>. Then, you will type one space and the name of the function:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  def name</strong>
</pre></div><p>Next, you will add parentheses <code class="literal">()</code> and a colon <code class="literal">:</code> to the first line:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  def name():</strong>
</pre></div><p>Now, it is time to go to the next line. For the next line, you will need to indent. Use the spacebar to insert four spaces. In Python, spaces matter. Using the <em>Tab</em> key, or mixing between tab and space, is a problem in Python and causes errors.</p><p>Since we are asking the user for their first name, you can use the words <code class="literal">first_name</code> for the variable if you like:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>   def name():</strong>
<strong>      first_name =</strong>
</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">first_name</code> variable will store the answer to the question, <code class="literal">What is your first name?</code> Remember, though, we have to use the <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> function to get the user to answer the question! So, we will add the <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> function and question to the code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  def name():</strong>
<strong>      first_name = input('What is your first name?')</strong>
</pre></div><p>So far, we have programmed a way for the computer to ask the user for their first name, and we have made a variable called <code class="literal">first_name</code> to remember the string of information.</p><p>Even though we have a file that has some lines of code, if we were to run our code right now, nothing at all would happen. We need a way to show the user their name, and it would be even nicer if we sent the user a welcoming message. We need to write the code for program output.</p><p>We have been using <a id="id76" class="indexterm"/>
<code class="literal">print</code> to output our information from <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Welcome! Let's Get Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Welcome! Let's Get Started</em>, and throughout this chapter, and <code class="literal">print</code> is also useful here. We can tell our function to print the <code class="literal">first_name</code> information, and we can put that together with a nice message. Add this line to your code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>     print('So nice to meet you, ' + first_name)</strong>
</pre></div><p>Your total code for the <code class="literal">name()</code> function should look like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>def name():</strong>
<strong>      first_name = input('What is your first name?')</strong>
<strong>      print('So nice to meet you, ' + first_name)</strong>
</pre></div><p>Here is a sample of how the program looks in a text editor:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_12_replace.jpg" alt="Writing code"/></div><p>We need only to add the final line of code, which is to call the <code class="literal">name()</code> function. If we do not call the function, it will not run. To call the function, you should leave an empty line after <code class="literal">print</code>, and on a new line, unindent and type <code class="literal">name()</code>. Take a look at this code sample, and add the <code class="literal">name()</code> function to your code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>def name():</strong>
<strong>      first_name = input('What is your first name?')</strong>
<strong>      print('So nice to meet you, ' + first_name)</strong>

<strong>name()</strong>
</pre></div><p>Now that we have created this function, we can use it to greet anybody because the user is telling us each time what <code class="literal">first_name</code><a id="id77" class="indexterm"/> should be. We have made a reusable block of code.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec18"/>Running your program</h2></div></div></div><p>Now you have<a id="id78" class="indexterm"/> to save your work:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to the <strong>Save</strong> option in your text editor and save the work for <code class="literal">name.py</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Once you have saved this work, you should go to your terminal/command prompt.</li><li class="listitem">Make sure that you are in the correct folder.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>If you are not sure, you can type <code class="literal">pwd</code> (Mac/Linux) or <code class="literal">echo %cd%</code> (Windows) to find out what folder you are in.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">When you are in the same folder as your work, type:<div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>   python name.py</strong>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Then, press <em>Enter</em>. Your program should begin to run.</li></ol></div><p>Once you type in the name, the output should look like this:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_02_11.jpg" alt="Running your program"/></div><p>You now have a program to share with family and friends that will seem amazing, especially if they have never programmed before!</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec19"/>Going the extra mile</h1></div></div></div><p>So, if you really want to understand all of this, go the extra mile! Experiment with the code that you just created so that you can see what works and what does not work. If you get a strange error, you can <a id="id79" class="indexterm"/>always copy and paste the error into an Internet search engine; most of the errors we've taken a look at so far have happened to other people. Here are some tips to help you experiment and gain mastery:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Change the input question</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Change the message to the user</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Change the function name</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Change the variable name</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Add a second variable and a second input question</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Add the <a id="id80" class="indexterm"/>second variable to the output question</li></ul></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we learned how to store information in variables so that a computer could remember it later. We learned how to use variables to make a function that could add two preprogrammed numbers together. Then, things got interesting when we learned how to make the computer ask questions and remember the user's answers! Using <code class="literal">raw_input()</code>, we learned how to store answers as variables to use later in the <code class="literal">name()</code> function that we built together. We started saving our work in <code class="literal">.py</code> files so that we could run and rerun our files in our terminal/command prompt without having to retype the files all the time.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will build a four-function calculator to run in the command line using all of the skills you learned in this chapter!</p></div></body></html>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">I am sure that almost anyone who has ever been curious about trading has heard about fundamental and technical analyses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">As with many popular terms, there’s a good deal of misunderstanding </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">with both.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Most likely, you know that there is an analyst profession and that this profession is in demand in the financial industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">You might have even considered this profession for yourself because you heard that modern analysts use advanced computer technologies and come from the world of data science. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">However, there is a crucial difference between the two concepts; thus, the mathematical and computer inventory used with each of them is radically different. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">Moreover, their use in actual trading algorithms is also quite different. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">Let’s have a deeper look into both and see how (and if) we can use them in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">our applications.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">We will review the key principles of fundamental and technical analyses, learn how markets react to important economic, political, and other events, and get familiar with two approaches to analyzing price behavior: one based on non-price information and the other using price time </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">series only.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">In this chapter, we will cover the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">following topics:</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Fundamental analysis – intuitive but of little practical use</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">The idea of fundamental analysis is easily understandable: markets are known to react to various external </span><a id="_idIndexMarker334"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">information, so let’s study this reaction to help us to predict the market’s behavior. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.2">The </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">external information</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1"> in question depends on the market and can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">differ significantly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Let’s start with probably the most evident factor that clearly affects the market prices: </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">economic news.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">Economic news</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">This is the most well-known type of fundamental data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">In layperson’s terms, the better the economic situation, the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker335"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">greater the price of the asset. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">For example, if the nationwide economy shows growth, the most liquid stocks also grow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">Yes, of course, there are exceptions, nuances, and so on, but overall, there is a positive correlation between the major macroeconomic indicators and the stock </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">market’s growth.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">But wait, why are we talking </span><a id="_idIndexMarker336"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">about stock markets while our main point of interest is </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">forex</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> (</span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">FX</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">)?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">With the FX market, economic indicators such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">gross domestic product</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">GDP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">), </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">jobless rate</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">core price index</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">CPI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> – the main inflation indicator), and others do not have any real </span><a id="_idIndexMarker337"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">long-term effect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.2">Why? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.3">Because currencies have one feature that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker338"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">makes them completely different from any other </span><a id="_idIndexMarker339"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">asset class: they have </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">interest rates</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">To understand the concept of the interest rate, we should recall the mechanism that brings money into the economy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">The central bank or a similar institution (such as the Federal Reserve of the United States) </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">emits</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> money. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">In earlier days, it meant minting coins, then printing the bills, and today, it also (and mostly) means making changes in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">databases electronically.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">But in any case, the path of money into the economy goes through banks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">The central bank doesn’t just give money away to banks for free – banks pay </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">interest</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> to the central bank at a rate that is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker340"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">consequently called the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">interest rate</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">Banks also lend money to their clients – retail, businesses, and other banks – at different interest rates, which are, of course, greater than the rate at which they borrow from the central bank. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.3">And when your broker provides you with a credit line to facilitate margin trading (see </span><a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">FX Market Overview from a Developer’s Standpoint</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">, in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Trade mechanics – some terminology</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> section), they do not provide it for free, but rather at a rate that is, again, slightly higher than the rate at which they can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">borrow it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">This structure may look a bit confusing at first glance, but the key things you should remember are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Whatever you do within a single working day between the bank settlements does not count toward </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">any interest</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">As soon as you hold your FX position overnight, you either pay interest or receive it – depending on the difference in interest rates between currencies in the traded </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">currency pair</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Let’s consider an </span><a id="_idIndexMarker341"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">In 2007, the Japanese yen could be borrowed at a rate close to zero, and the British pound at a rate of over 5%, peaking at 5.75% in July 2007. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.3">If you bought GBPJPY in 2007 – remember that this means that you buy the British pound by selling the Japanese yen – you benefit from an interest rate differential of about 5% per annum, which you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">receive</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> every night. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">On the contrary, if you sold GBPJPY in 2007, then you would </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">pay</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> the interest every night. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">Now, multiply these numbers by the leverage provided by the broker (and back in 2007, in certain cases, it could reach 700:1 for select clients!) and you can imagine </span><a id="_idIndexMarker342"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">a sort of a Holy Grail of FX trading, which is called </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">carry trading</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Carry trading</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Carry trading refers to buying an asset and holding it for a considerable time, not only aiming at making a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker343"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">profit by selling the asset later at a higher price, but also collecting interest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">If you are interested in learning more about carry trading, I’d recommend starting with an introductory article at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Investopedia: </span></span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/07/carry_trade.asp"><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/07/carry_trade.asp</span></span></a><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Of course, carry trading doesn’t last long because interest rates change, and since the introduction of the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">zero interest rate policy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">ZIRP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">) after the financial crisis of 2008, carry trading degraded </span><a id="_idIndexMarker344"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">substantially. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">However, understanding the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker345"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">fact that no money is free on the market helps understand why macroeconomic indicators don’t have such a long-term impact on the currency market as they do on stocks </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">and equities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Nevertheless, macroeconomic news does have some impact on the currency market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">The point here is that although stocks and equities are more affected by the economic news background, they </span><a id="_idIndexMarker346"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">are all purchased </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">for money</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">So, although not immediately, interest rates also affect the cost of investment into stocks and equities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">Therefore, releases of important macroeconomic news (especially GDP, jobless rate, and CPI) are closely observed by currency traders, and that’s why we normally expect fast price movements in currencies before and after the publication of these </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">economic indicators.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">To illustrate this, let’s look at a couple of examples </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">from history.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">US non-farm payrolls</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">The US </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">non-farm payroll</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">NFP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">) is one of the most observed key macroeconomic indicators. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">It represents the number of new jobs countrywide in all industries except for agriculture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">Normally, the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker347"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">greater the reading of this indicator, the better the state </span><a id="_idIndexMarker348"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">of the country’s economy is considered to be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">Consequently, the stock markets normally grow with the growth in new jobs and the domestic currency appreciates </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">versus others.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">In the FX markets, quite often, we observe sharp price movements at the moment when the US NFP is released. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">It usually happens when the published reading deviates significantly from the previously forecasted values. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">It is not so much important whether the reading itself is even positive or negative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.4">For example, if a forecast predicted growth in new jobs by 5% and the actual published value is only 2%, then despite this value being positive, the market reaction will most likely be negative – because this value falls short of expectations. </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Figure 6</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">.1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1"> shows a nice example of such a price movement in EURUSD a few seconds after the release of the US NFP on August </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">5, 2022:</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">Several minutes before the release of the news, liquidity providers prefer to withdraw liquidity from order books before the publication to avoid possible losses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">And we already know that the less the liquidity, the faster and greater the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">price movements.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">Again, as in the case with the US NFP, there was almost no liquidity right after the release of this economic news, and therefore, any attempt to trade immediately after or immediately before it </span><a id="_idIndexMarker359"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">was really problematic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">We can see that the price </span><a id="_idIndexMarker360"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">stabilized only 1-2 seconds after the event at a price level that is about 16-20 pips higher than immediately before it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">This means that liquidity providers were back in the market by that time, but now, their bids and offers were significantly higher than just a couple of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">seconds before.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Institutional fundamental research is way more complex and includes a great number of factors, but in the long run, they can produce only long-term forecasts or investment advice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">This happens because modern markets are so tightly connected to one another and these connections are so complex (and at the same time, factors that affect the market price are so numerous) that it becomes really problematic to use fundamental analysis of macroeconomic events for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">practical trading.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Does it mean, then, that we can safely disregard fundamental analysis and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">macroeconomic events?</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">Political events</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">Political events (such as presidential elections, wars, global treaties and declarations, and so on) also affect </span><a id="_idIndexMarker363"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">the markets, and the price behavior before and soon after such an event is somewhat similar to that of a reaction to regular economic news. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.2">This isn’t surprising because the mechanics behind the scenes is the same – everyone knows that this is a major event, no one wants to take excessive risk, liquidity providers withdraw liquidity from the books, and any new order, even small in size, can momentarily drive the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">price anywhere.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">The difference between political and regular economic events is probably in the duration of the price movement after the event. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">Let’s consider a couple </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">of examples.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">You can see that the publication of the official poll results caused the rate of GBPUSD to fall 600 pips in 2 minutes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">This is one of the fastest movements in major currency pairs throughout the entire history of the forex market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.3">This sharp fall was almost completely played back in the following 20-30 minutes, and again, there was no surprise in it because the liquidity was returning to the market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.4">However, the following downward price movement continued and lasted not just for minutes and even not for hours, but for days. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.5">So, at least theoretically, Brexit again provided an opportunity for a speculative trade – to sell GBPUSD on Brexit day and exit the position a few hours or even </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">days later.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">Normally, fundamental information of this sort almost doesn’t affect the currency rates because the scope </span><a id="_idIndexMarker368"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">of its effect is too narrow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">You can think about a currency as the largest market index, which includes all industries and all aspects of the economy of a particular country and compares them to those of another country in a currency pair. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">Most developed countries make every effort to keep their economies balanced and diversified. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.4">So, in case something happens, say, only in microelectronics, car manufacturing, agriculture, or healthcare – well, yes, it may affect the currency rates for a very limited time, but the effect will be so small, almost negligible, that normally, currency traders disregard fundamental information of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">this sort.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">There are some notable exceptions though. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">There are countries whose economies are very tightly connected to only one or two industries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">For these countries, fundamental factors that are specific to the key industry </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">do</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1"> affect the entire economy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">Let’s consider the most prominent example of how industry-specific news and prices of just a single commodity may be highly correlated with the rate of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">domestic currency.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">We can see that fundamental factors do affect the prices of currencies, but we also can see key problems with using these factors in automated trading, such as the (a) releases of macroeconomic news mostly cause the unpredicted direction of price movements, and these movements frequently do not last long enough to trade, (b) political events cause longer price movements and are potentially tradable, but they are rare, and it’s easier to trade them manually than programmatically, (c) using industry-specific fundamental factors is potentially the most promising, but requires a thorough analysis of the respective industry and works only for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">specific currencies.</span></span></p>

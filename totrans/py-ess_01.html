On other computers, we'll need to add the <a class="indexterm" id="id0"/>Python program and related tools. The installation is pretty simple, but we'll review the details to be sure that everyone has a common foundation.</p><p>Once we have Python, we'll need to confirm that Python is present. In some cases, we'll have more than one version of Python available. We need to be sure that we're using Python 3.4 or newer. To confirm that Python's available, we'll do a few interactions at Python's <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.</p><p>To extend our foundation for the remaining chapters, we'll look at a few essential rules of Python syntax. This isn't complete, but it will help us write scripts and learn the language. After we've had more chances to work with simple and compound statements, the detailed syntax rules will make sense.</p><p>We'll also look at the Python "ecosystem", starting with the built-in standard library. We'll emphasize the standard library throughout this book for two reasons. First, it's immense—much of what we need is already on our computer. Second, and more important, studying this library is the best way to learn the finer points of Python programming.</p><p>Beyond<a class="indexterm" id="id1"/> the built-in library, we'll take a look at the <strong>Python Package Index</strong> (<strong>PyPI</strong>). If we can't find the right module in the standard library, the <a class="indexterm" id="id2"/>second place to look for extensions is PyPI—<a class="ulink" href="https://pypi.python.org">https://pypi.python.org</a>.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Installation or upgrade</h1></div></div></div><p>To work<a class="indexterm" id="id3"/> with <a class="indexterm" id="id4"/>Python on Windows, we must install Python. For Mac OS X and Linux, a version of Python is already present; we'll often want to add a newer version to the preinstalled Python.</p><p>There are two significantly different flavors of Python available:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python 2.x</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python 3.x</li></ul></div><p>This book is about Python 3.4. We won't cover Python 2.x at all. There are several visible differences. What's important is that Python 2.x is a bit of a mess under the hood. Python 3 reflects some fundamental improvements. The improvements came at the cost of a few areas where the two versions of the language had to be made incompatible.</p><p>The Python <a class="indexterm" id="id5"/>community is continuing to keep Python 2.x around. Doing<a class="indexterm" id="id6"/> this is a help to people who are stuck with old software. For the most part, developers are moving forward with Python 3 because it's a clear improvement.</p><p>Before we get started, it's important to know if Python is already installed. The general test to see if Python is already installed is to get an OS command prompt. For Windows, use Command Prompt; for Mac OS X or Linux, use the Terminal tool. We'll show Mac OS X prompts from the Mac OS X Terminal. It looks like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>We've shown the OS prompt <code class="literal">MacBookPro-SLott:~ slott$</code>. We entered the <code class="literal">python3</code> command, which is typical for Linux and Mac OS X. In Windows, we'll often enter just <code class="literal">python</code>. The response was three lines of introduction followed by the <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt. Enter <code class="literal">exit</code> and hit <em>return</em> to get some useful advice on how to leave Python. This example showed Python 3.3, which is a little out of date. An upgrade isn't required.</p><p>Some kind of "command not found" error from the OS means we don't have any Python, so we'll need to do an install.</p><p>If we get a Python message that starts with something like "Python 2.7.6", we'll need to do an upgrade.</p><p>The next section covers Windows installations. After that, we'll look at Mac OS X and then we will see Linux upgrades. In some cases, we may develop software on Windows desktop computers, but the ultimate destination is a large, centralized Linux server. The Python files can be the same between these two environments, so having Python on multiple platforms won't be very complex or confusing.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Installing Python on Windows</h2></div></div></div><p>Python <a class="indexterm" id="id7"/>runs<a class="indexterm" id="id8"/> on many versions of Windows. There are some older, less-widely-used versions of Windows without an actively supported version of Python. For example, Windows 2000 is not supported.</p><p>The<a class="indexterm" id="id9"/> general procedure for installing Python is quite simple. We'll download an installer and do some preparation. Then we'll start the installer. Once that's finished, we'll be up and running.</p><p>To find <a class="indexterm" id="id10"/>the installer, start here:</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>
</p><p>The web<a class="indexterm" id="id11"/> server should detect your OS and provide a big button with some variation of "Download Python 3.4.x" on it. Click on this button to start the download.</p><p>To look at the choices available, the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/</a> path provides all of the actively-supported versions of Python. This will show a long list of older versions. There are two installers available:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Windows x86 MSI installer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Windows x86-64 MSI installer</li></ul></div><p>If we have a very old computer, we might need the 32-bit version. Most modern computers will have a 64-bit CPU. When in doubt, 64-bit is the assumption to make.</p><p>Double-click the <code class="literal">.msi</code> file to start running the installer. This starts with a question about installing Python for yourself or for all users. If you have appropriate privileges, the all users option is appropriate. On a shared computer, without appropriate privileges, you'll have to install it for yourself only.</p><div><img alt="Installing Python on Windows" src="img/B03671_01_01.jpg"/></div><p>The second page will ask for an installation directory. Be careful about the path that you choose for the installation, and avoid spaces in filenames.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>Do<a class="indexterm" id="id12"/> not install Python into directories with spaces in their names. Avoid names such as "Program Files" and "My Documents". The space may cause problems that are difficult to diagnose.</p><p>Install Python into a simple directory with a short, space-free name like <code class="literal">C:\python34</code>.</p></div></div><div><img alt="Installing Python on Windows" src="img/B03671_01_02.jpg"/></div><p>Spaces in filenames is not a general problem, but it is awkward when first starting. There are many ways to <a class="indexterm" id="id13"/>cope with spaces in filenames. When learning a new programming language, however, it's important to minimize the awkward problems so that we can focus on the important topics.</p><p>The next page will also show a menu of components that can be installed; it's easiest to request everything. There's no compelling reason to turn off any of the optional components. We'll be looking at the IDLE development tool, which requires the <strong>Tcl/Tk</strong> package, so it's important to be sure that this is part of the installation.</p><p>In many cases, the final option on this list updates the system environment variables to include Python on the <code class="literal">PATH</code> variable. This isn't enabled by default, but it can be helpful if you're going to write BAT files in Windows.</p><div><img alt="Installing Python on Windows" src="img/B03671_01_03.jpg"/></div><p>In addition<a class="indexterm" id="id14"/> to the basic Python interpreter, the Windows help installer is very helpful. This is a separate download and requires a quick installation. After we've installed this, we can use the <em>F1</em> key to bring up all of the Python documentation.</p><p>Once Python is installed, the <em>Using the Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL)</em> section will show how to start interacting with Python.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>Considering some alternatives</h3></div></div></div><p>We'll<a class="indexterm" id="id15"/> focus on a particular implementation of Python called <strong>CPython</strong>. The distinction we're making here is that Python—the <a class="indexterm" id="id16"/>abstract language—can be processed by a variety of concrete Python runtimes or implementations. The CPython implementation is written in portable C and can be recompiled for many operating systems. This implementation tends to be extremely fast.</p><p>For Windows developers, there's an alternative implementation called <strong>Iron Python</strong>. This is tightly integrated<a class="indexterm" id="id17"/> with the Windows .NET development environment. It has the advantage of working with Visual Studio. It has the disadvantage of being based on the Python 2.7 language.</p><p>Another<a class="indexterm" id="id18"/> choice Windows users have is to use <strong>Python Tools for Visual Studio</strong> (<strong>PTVS</strong>). This will allow you to use Python 3.4 from within Visual Studio. For developers who are used to Visual Studio, this might prove helpful.</p><p>Other <a class="indexterm" id="id19"/>Python implementations include Jython, Stackless Python, and PyPy. These alternatives are available for all operating systems, so we'll address these in the <em>Looking at other Python interpreters</em> section later.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Upgrading to Python 3.4 in Mac OS X</h2></div></div></div><p>Python <a class="indexterm" id="id20"/>runs on all versions of Mac OS X. It turns<a class="indexterm" id="id21"/> out that Mac OS X relies on Python. However, it relies on Python 2.7, so we'll need to add Python 3.4.</p><p>The general procedure for installing Python on Mac OS X is quite simple. We'll download a disk image (<code class="literal">.dmg</code>) installer and do some preparation. Then we'll start the installer that's in the disk image. Once that's finished, we'll be up and running.</p><p>To find<a class="indexterm" id="id22"/> an installer, start here:</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>
</p><p>The web server should detect your OS and provide a big button with some variation of "Download Python 3.4.x" on it. Click on this and download the <code class="literal">.dmg</code> file.</p><p>To look at the choices available, the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/</a> path provides all of the actively-supported versions of Python for Mac OS X. This will show alternatives for older versions of Python.</p><p>When the <code class="literal">.dmg</code> device becomes available after the download, double-click on the <code class="literal">.mpkg</code> installer file to start running the installer.</p><div><img alt="Upgrading to Python 3.4 in Mac OS X" src="img/B03671_01_04.jpg"/></div><p>Clicking<a class="indexterm" id="id23"/> on <strong>Continue</strong> will step through the <strong>Read Me</strong>, <strong>License</strong>, <strong>Destination Select</strong>, and <strong>Installation Type</strong> windows. There's a <strong>Customize</strong> button<a class="indexterm" id="id24"/> that allows us to turn options on and off. We won't need to do this—the default installation is ideal.</p><p>We'll need to provide the username and password of a user who's authorized to administer this computer. This will not remove the existing Python that Mac OS X uses. It will add another version of Python. This means that we'll have at least two copies of Python. We'll focus on using Python 3, ignoring the built-in Python, which is Python 2.</p><p>To use Python 3, we have to enter <code class="literal">python3</code> at the OS prompt in the Terminal window. If we have <em>both</em> Python 3.3 and Python 3.4, we can enter the even more specific <code class="literal">python3.4</code> at the command prompt to specify which version of Python 3 we're using. Generally, the <code class="literal">python3</code> command will be the latest-and-greatest version of Python 3. The <code class="literal">python</code> command—unadorned with a version number—will be the Python 2.x that Mac OS X requires.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>Adding the Tkinter package</h3></div></div></div><p>Python<a class="indexterm" id="id25"/> relies on a library named Tkinter to provide support for writing programs with a GUI. This package relies on Tcl/Tk. The details can be <a class="indexterm" id="id26"/>found here:</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/">https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/</a>
</p><p>The summary of this is that we need to install version 8.5.17 or newer. See <a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/#activetcl-8-5-17-0">https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/#activetcl-8-5-17-0</a>. This will provide a graphic environment that Python will use. We must install Tcl/Tk in order for the <code class="literal">tkinter</code> package to work.</p><p>After we download the <code class="literal">.dmg</code> file and open the <code class="literal">.pkg</code> file, we'll see this window:</p><div><img alt="Adding the Tkinter package" src="img/B03671_01_05.jpg"/></div><p>We'll be looking at the IDLE development tool, which requires <code class="literal">tkinter</code>. Consequently, this additional installation is essential.</p><p>We can avoid this extra download if we avoid using <code class="literal">tkinter</code>. Some developers prefer to use the Active State Komodo editor as their development tool; this does not require Tcl/Tk. Also, there<a class="indexterm" id="id27"/> are numerous add-on GUI frameworks that don't require <code class="literal">tkinter</code>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Upgrading to Python 3.4 in Linux</h2></div></div></div><p>For<a class="indexterm" id="id28"/> Linux, the latest Python may already be installed. When <a class="indexterm" id="id29"/>we enter <code class="literal">python3</code>, we may see that we already have a useful version available. In this case, we're ready to roll. In some cases, the OS will only have an older Python (perhaps older than 2.7) installed. In this case, we'll need to upgrade.</p><p>For Linux distributions, there are two paths for upgrading Python:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing prebuilt packages: Many distributions have appropriate packages already <a class="indexterm" id="id30"/>available. We can use a package manager (such as <code class="literal">yum</code> or <code class="literal">RPM</code>) to locate and install the necessary Python package. In some cases, there will be additional dependencies, leading to a cascade of downloads and installs. Since Python 3.4 is relatively new, there may not be very many prebuilt packages for your particular<a class="indexterm" id="id31"/> Linux distribution. Details are available at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#on-linux">https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#on-linux</a>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Building from source: Most Linux distributions include the GNU C compiler. We can <a class="indexterm" id="id32"/>download the Python source, configure the build script, and use <code class="literal">make</code> and <code class="literal">make install</code> to build Python. This may require upgrading some Linux libraries to assure that your Linux installation has the required support for Python 3.4. The installation steps are summarized as <code class="literal">./configure</code>, <code class="literal">make</code>, and <code class="literal">sudo make altinstall</code>. Details are available at <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python">https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python</a>.</li></ul></div><p>When we use <code class="literal">altinstall</code>, we'll end up with two Pythons installed. We'll have an older Python, which we can run using the <code class="literal">python</code> command. The <code class="literal">python3</code> command will, generally, be linked to the latest version of Python 3. If we need to be explicit, we can use the <code class="literal">python3.4</code> command to select a specific version.</p><p>As with the Mac OS X installation, adding the Python <code class="literal">tkinter</code> package is important. Sometimes, this is separate from the basic package. This may lead to upgrading Tcl/Tk, which may lead to some more downloads and installs. At other times, the Linux distribution has an up-to-date Tcl/Tk environment and nothing more needs to be done.</p><p>We can avoid the extra Tcl/Tk download if we avoid using <code class="literal">tkinter</code>. As mentioned earlier, many developers prefer to use the Active State Komodo editor as their development tool; this does not require <code class="literal">tkinter</code>. Also, there are numerous GUI frameworks that aren't based on <code class="literal">tkinter</code>.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Using the Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL)</h1></div></div></div><p>Once we have installed Python 3, we can do some minimal interaction with Python to assure ourselves that things are working. In the long run, we'll use a number of other tools to<a class="indexterm" id="id33"/> create Python programs. To start out, we'll interact directly on the command line.</p><p>Python's <strong>Read-Evaluate-Print Loop</strong> (<strong>REPL</strong>) is the foundation for Python programming. More sophisticated things—such as writing application scripts or web servers—are essentially the same as interaction with the REPL: the Python program reads statements from our application script file or web server script file and evaluates those statements.</p><p>This fundamental rule is one of the very appealing features of Python. We can write sophisticated scripts, or we can interact with the language in the REPL; the language is the same.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Confirming that things are working</h2></div></div></div><p>To <a class="indexterm" id="id34"/>confirm that things are working, we'll start the Python interpreter from a command-line prompt.

<strong>Python 3.3.4 (v3.3.4:7ff62415e426, Feb  9 2014, 00:29:34)</strong>

<strong>Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.</strong>
<strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong>
</pre></div><p>The details of getting to a command prompt vary from OS to OS. We've shown the Mac OS X Terminal tool in this example. We entered the <code class="literal">python3</code> command to be sure we ran our new version of Python, not the built-in Python 2.</p><p>The introductory message lists four special-purpose objects that are incorporated into the interactive Python environment. There are two more, <code class="literal">quit</code> and <code class="literal">exit</code>, which are also available. These are only present in the REPL interactive environment; they cannot be used in programs.</p><p>We'll look at how we get help later in a separate section, <em>Interacting with the help subsystem</em>. The other objects, however, produce useful tidbits of information and are the ideal way to be sure things are working. Enter <code class="literal">copyright</code>, <code class="literal">credits</code>, or <code class="literal">license</code> at the <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt to confirm that Python is working.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Doing simple arithmetic</h2></div></div></div><p>The REPL<a class="indexterm" id="id35"/> loop prints the results of each statement, allowing us to work with Python interactively. To be clear on what this means, we should define what constitutes a <strong>statement</strong> in the language. We'll avoid the strict formality <a class="indexterm" id="id36"/>of the Python language definition and provide a quick, informal definition of the relevant statement type.</p><p>The Python<a class="indexterm" id="id37"/> language has 20 or so kinds of statements. An expression—by itself—is a statement. Unless the value of the expression is <code class="literal">None</code>, the REPL will show the value of the expression. We'll often use an expression statement to evaluate functions that perform input and output.</p><p>This simple expression statement allows us to do things such as the following at the Python <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; 355/113
3.1415929203539825</pre></div><p>We can enter any arithmetic expression. Python evaluates the expression, and if the result isn't <code class="literal">None</code>, we'll see the result. We've shown the true division operator, <code class="literal">/</code>, in this example.</p><p>We'll look at the various data types and operators in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Simple Data Types">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Simple Data Types</em>. For the moment, we'll identify a few features of Python. We have numbers in a variety of flavors, including integers, floating point, and complex values. Most values will be properly coerced to add precision. Have a look at these examples:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * 3.14 * 8j
50.24j
&gt;&gt;&gt; _ **2
(-2524.0576+0j)</pre></div><p>The first expression computed a value that includes an integer, <code class="literal">2</code>; a floating point value, <code class="literal">3.14</code>; and a complex value, <code class="literal">8j</code>. We used the <code class="literal">*</code> operator for multiplication. The result is complex, <code class="literal">50.24j</code>.</p><p>The second expression uses the <code class="literal">_</code> variable. This is a handy feature that's unique to the REPL. The result of each expression is implicitly assigned to this variable. We can use <code class="literal">_</code> in an expression to refer to the result of the previous expression. This only works in the REPL; it's never a part of a script.</p><p>When we computed <code class="literal">_ **2</code>, we squared <code class="literal">50.24j</code>. This is -2524.0576. Since the source value was a complex number, the result is also a complex value even though the imaginary component of that complex value is zero. This is typical of Python—the data types of the operand values generally dictate the data types of the result of the operator. When there are different kinds of numbers, values are coerced according to the rules we'll look at in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Simple Data Types">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Simple Data Types</em>.</p><p>There's one notable exception to the rule that the types of the operands match the type of the result. The true division operator, <code class="literal">/</code>, produces floating point results from integer operands. The floor division operator, <code class="literal">//</code>, on the other hand, reflects the types of the operands. For example:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; 355 / 113
3.1415929203539825
&gt;&gt;&gt; 355 // 113
3</pre></div><p>We have these two division operators so that we can unambiguously specify what kind of division we'd like<a class="indexterm" id="id38"/> to perform. It saves us from having to write extra code to explicitly coerce results.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Assigning results to variables</h2></div></div></div><p>The<a class="indexterm" id="id39"/> simple assignment statement produces no visible output:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; v = 23</pre></div><p>This will create the variable <code class="literal">v</code> and assign the value of 23 to it. We can check this by using a very small expression statement. The expression is just the variable name:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; v
23</pre></div><p>When we evaluate a very simple expression, such as <code class="literal">v</code>, we see the value of the variable.</p><p>Python's REPL has far-reaching consequences. Perhaps the most important consequence is that almost all examples of Python programming are provided as if we're entering the code at the <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt. The documentation for very complex and sophisticated packages will be written as though we're going to use that package interactively. In most cases, we'll be writing application programs; we won't really do very much at the <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt. But the idea of cutting through the complexity to arrive at something that can be done interactively is pervasive throughout the Python community.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>Using import to add features</h2></div></div></div><p>One<a class="indexterm" id="id40"/> significant part of Python is the presence of a vast library of additional features. Using an external library means that the core language can be kept quite simple. We can import any additional features we need, avoiding the clutter and complication of unused features.</p><p>The <code class="literal">import</code> statement is<a class="indexterm" id="id41"/> used to incorporate additional functions, classes, and objects into a program or the interactive environment. There are a number of variations of this statement. For example, we might want to use some of the more sophisticated math functions. We can search the Python documentation and discover that these are defined in the <code class="literal">math</code> library. We can include and use them like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.pi
3.141592653589793
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sin( math.pi/6 )
0.49999999999999994</pre></div><p>In this <a class="indexterm" id="id42"/>example, we imported the <code class="literal">math</code> library. We evaluated <code class="literal">math.pi</code> to see one of the constants defined in this library. We evaluated <img alt="Using import to add features" src="img/B03671_01_06.jpg"/>.The result was almost (but not exactly) 1/2.</p><p>This<a class="indexterm" id="id43"/> also shows us an important thing about floating point numbers—they're just an approximation. This has nothing to do with Python specifically—it's a general feature of digital computing. It's very important to emphasize this fact about floating point numbers.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>Floating point numbers are only an approximation. They're not exact. They are not the abstract mathematical ideal of an irrational number with infinite precision.</p></div></div><p>We'll return to the topic of floating point numbers in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Simple Data Types">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Simple Data Types</em>. For now, we want to focus on external libraries.</p><p>One important library module that is part of Python is named <code class="literal">this</code>. To see the <code class="literal">this</code> module, enter <code class="literal">import this</code> at the <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt, like so:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; import this</pre></div><p>Another equally important module is <code class="literal">antigravity</code>.</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; import antigravity</pre></div><p>We'll leave the exploration of these modules as exercises for the reader. We don't want to spoil the fun! More handwaving explanation isn't as helpful as hands-on experience. See <a class="ulink" href="http://xkcd.com/413/">http://xkcd.com/413/</a> for more on this topic.</p><p>We'll summarize by noting that the name "Python" has much to do with Monty Python and nothing to do with serpents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Interacting with the help subsystem</h1></div></div></div><p>Python's <a class="indexterm" id="id44"/>interactive help utility provides a great deal of useful information about modules, classes, functions, and objects. The help system is an environment that is distinct from Python's REPL; it provides distinct prompts to make this clear.</p><p>There are three help modes, each with its unique prompt:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We'll see the <code class="literal">help&gt;</code> prompt<a class="indexterm" id="id45"/> from the Python help environment. When we evaluate the <code class="literal">help()</code> function with no argument value, we'll enter Python's help environment. We can enter different subjects and read about various Python features. When we enter <code class="literal">quit</code> as <a class="indexterm" id="id46"/>a topic, we'll return to the REPL.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using Windows, we'll see the <code class="literal">-- More --</code> prompt: When we evaluate something like <code class="literal">help(int)</code> in a <a class="indexterm" id="id47"/>Windows environment, the output will be displayed using the MS-DOS <strong>more</strong> command. For <a class="indexterm" id="id48"/>more information, enter <code class="literal">?</code> for help on how to page through the <code class="literal">help()</code> output. At the Windows command line, entering <code class="literal">more /?</code> will provide additional information on how the <strong>more</strong> command helps you page through a long file.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using Mac OS X and Linux, we'll see the <code class="literal">:</code> prompt. When<a class="indexterm" id="id49"/> we evaluate the <code class="literal">help()</code> function with a specific argument value—for example, <code class="literal">help(float)</code>—in Mac OS X or Linux, we'll get output that's displayed using the <strong>less</strong> program. For<a class="indexterm" id="id50"/> more information on this, enter <code class="literal">h</code> for help while viewing the <code class="literal">help()</code> output. At the command prompt, enter <code class="literal">less -?</code> for more information on how the <strong>less</strong> program works.</li></ul></div><p>There are additional ways to view the documentation available with Python modules. In IDLE, for example, there's a class browser and path browser that will show documentation about modules and files. This is based on the built-in <code class="literal">help()</code> function, but it's displayed in a separate window.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"/>Using the pydoc program</h2></div></div></div><p>Python <a class="indexterm" id="id51"/>includes the pydoc application that we use to <a class="indexterm" id="id52"/>view documentation. This application is something that we run from the OS command prompt. We do not use this from the Python <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt; we use it from the OS prompt. While developing, we might want to leave a Terminal window open just to display module documentation.</p><p>The <code class="literal">pydoc</code> program <a class="indexterm" id="id53"/>has two operating modes:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It can show some documentation about a specific package or module. This will use an appropriate program (<strong>more</strong> on Windows, but otherwise <strong>less</strong>) to display documentation for the given object. Here's how we can display documentation on the <code class="literal">math</code> module:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>MacBookPro-SLott:~ slott$ python3 -m pydoc math</strong>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It can start a documentation web server. This will start a server (and also start a browser) to look at Python module documentation. When we use it, we'll have a session that looks like this:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>MacBookPro-SLott:~ slott$ python3 -m pydoc -b</strong>
<strong>Server ready at http://localhost:50177/</strong>
<strong>Server commands: [b]rowser, [q]uit</strong>
<strong>server&gt; q</strong>
<strong>Server stopped</strong>
</pre></div></li></ul></div><p>The second example will start a web server as well as a browser. The browser will show the pydoc-produced documentation. This is derived from the module and package structure as well as the documentation strings embedded in the Python code. When we were done reading the documentation, we entered <code class="literal">q</code> to quit the web server.</p><p>When<a class="indexterm" id="id54"/> we write Python packages, modules, classes, and <a class="indexterm" id="id55"/>functions, we can (and should) provide the content for <code class="literal">pydoc</code>/<code class="literal">help()</code> documentation. These documentation strings are part of our programming, and are as important as having programs that work correctly. We'll look at this embedded documentation in <a class="link" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Fit and Finish – Unit Testing, Packaging, and Documentation">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Fit and Finish – Unit Testing, Packaging, and Documentation</em>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Creating simple script files</h1></div></div></div><p>While <a class="indexterm" id="id56"/>we can use all of Python from the REPL, this is not a good way to produce a final application. Most of what we do with Python will be done via script files. We'll look at script files in detail in <a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Scripts, Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Applications">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Scripts, Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Applications</em>. For now, we'll look at a few features.</p><p>A script file<a class="indexterm" id="id57"/> has to follow a few rules:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The content must be plain text. While ASCII encoding is preferred by some, Python 3 can easily handle UTF-8 and most OS-specific variations such as Mac OS Roman or Windows CP-1252. A portable encoding like UTF-8 is strongly suggested.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python can cope with Mac OS X, Linux newline (<code class="literal">\n</code>), as well as Windows CR-LF (<code class="literal">\r\n</code>). Only a few Windows tools, such as Notepad, insist on CR-LF line endings; most other programming editors discern the line endings flexibly. Unless you really must use Notepad, it's often best to use Unix-style newline line endings.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The filename should be a legal Python identifier. This is not a requirement, but it gives us considerable flexibility if we follow this suggestion. The Language Reference Manual, section 2.3, provides the details of what constitutes an identifier. A summary of these rules is that identifiers must begin with a letter (or a Unicode character that normalizes to a letter) or <code class="literal">_</code>. It continues with letters, digits, and the <code class="literal">_</code> character. What's important is that we should avoid characters that are Python operators or delimiters in filenames. In particular, we should avoid the hyphen (<code class="literal">-</code>), which can become a problem in some Python contexts. OS filenames have much more flexible rules than Python identifiers, and the OS has ways to escape the meaning of OS-related punctuation; we <a class="indexterm" id="id58"/>are happiest when we limit our filenames to valid Python identifiers – letters, digits, and <code class="literal">_</code>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The filename extension should be <code class="literal">.py</code>. Again, this is not required, but it is very helpful to follow this rule.</li></ul></div><p>For <a class="indexterm" id="id59"/>example, we'll try to focus on names such as <code class="literal">test_1_2.py</code>. We can't as easily use a file named <code class="literal">test-1.2.py</code>; the base name isn't a valid identifier—this name looks like a Python expression. While the second name is acceptable for a top-level script, it won't work as a module or package.</p><p>We'll look at some Python syntax rules in the next section. For now, we can create a simple script file named <code class="literal">ex_1.py</code> that has one line:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">print("π≈", 355/113)</pre></div><p>We can also use <code class="literal">"\u03c0\u2248"</code> instead of <code class="literal">"π≈"</code>. The string <code class="literal">"\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER PI}\N{ALMOST EQUAL TO}"</code> will also work.</p><p>Once we have this file, we can have Python execute the file as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>MacBookPro-SLott:Chapter_1 slott$ python3 ex_1.py</strong>
<strong>π≈ 3.1415929203539825</strong>
</pre></div><p>We've provided a filename, <code class="literal">ex_1.py</code>, as the positional argument to the <code class="literal">python3</code> program. Python reads the file and executes each line. The output that we see is the text printed to the console by the <code class="literal">print()</code> function.</p><p>The file is found by Python using ordinary OS rules for locating files, starting with the current working directory. This will work with any kind of filename.</p><p>If we followed the naming rules for our file—the filename is an identifier and the extension is <code class="literal">.py</code>—we can also use the following command to execute a Python module:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>MacBookPro-SLott:Chapter_1 slott$ python3 -m ex_1</strong>
<strong>π≈ 3.1415929203539825</strong>
</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">-m ex_1</code> option forces Python to search for a module named <code class="literal">ex_1</code>. The file associated with this module is named <code class="literal">ex_1.py</code>. Python has a search path that it uses to find the requested module. Unless special arrangements are made, Python will search the local directory first, and then will search the library directories. This allows us to run our scripts and Python's built-in applications with a simple, uniform syntax. It also allows us to add our own applications and modules by modifying the <code class="literal">PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable.</p><p>We'll look at the search path in <a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Scripts, Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Applications">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Scripts, Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Applications</em>. The detailed documentation for the search path is part of the <code class="literal">site</code> package.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>Simplified syntax rules</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="id60"/>syntax rules for Python are defined in section 2 of the <em>Python Language Reference</em> manual. We'll look at the rules in detail in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Expressions and Output">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Expressions and Output</em>.</p><p>Python has<a class="indexterm" id="id61"/> about 20 kinds of statements. Here's a quick summary of the rules:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Almost all statements begin with a Python keyword such as <code class="literal">pass</code>, <code class="literal">if</code>, and <code class="literal">def</code>. The expression statement and the assignment statement are the exceptions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python <a class="indexterm" id="id62"/>has two kinds of statements—one-line <strong>simple</strong> statements <a class="indexterm" id="id63"/>and multiline <strong>compound</strong> statements.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Simple statements must be complete within a single line. An assignment statement is a simple statement. It begins with one or more user-provided identifiers and includes the <code class="literal">=</code> assignment symbol or an augmented variant like <code class="literal">+=</code>. An expression statement is also simple.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Compound statements use indentation to show the suite of statements embedded within the overall statement. The standard indentation is four spaces. Most developers set their editor to replace tabs with four spaces. Inconsistent use of spaces and tabs will lead to syntax errors that can be hard to see because tabs and spaces are both invisible by default. Avoiding tab characters in general makes it easier to debug problems.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Compound statements include class and function definitions—the body of the definition is indented. If statements and for and while loops are examples of compound statements that contain an indented suite of statements that are executed conditionally or repeatedly.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">(</code> and <code class="literal">)</code> characters must match. A single statement on a logical line may span multiple physical lines until the <code class="literal">(</code> and <code class="literal">)</code> characters match.</li></ul></div><p>In effect, Python programs consist of one-statement-one-line. The end of a line is the statement terminator. We have a few techniques for extending a statement. The most common technique is based on Python's requirement that the <code class="literal">(</code> and <code class="literal">)</code> characters must balance.</p><p>We can, for example, write code like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">print(
   "Hello world",
   "π≈",
   355/113
)</pre></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Downloading the example code</strong>
</p><p>You can download the example code files from your account at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com">http://www.packtpub.com</a> for all the Packt Publishing books you have purchased. If you purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com/support">http://www.packtpub.com/support</a> and register to have the files e-mailed directly to you.</p></div></div><p>We've spread a single logical line to four physical lines using <code class="literal">(</code> and <code class="literal">)</code>. One consequence of this is that a simple statement that we enter at the REPL must not be indented. A leading space will cause problems because leading spaces are used to show which statements are inside a compound statement.</p><p>Another consequence of this is less direct. Python executes a script file one statement at a time from start to finish. This means that complex Python programs will have a number of definitions first, and the "main" part of the processing will generally be last.</p><p>A Python<a class="indexterm" id="id64"/> comment starts with <code class="literal">#</code> and ends at the end of the<a class="indexterm" id="id65"/> line. This follows the same rules as the various Linux shells. Because of the way Python documentation strings are processed by <code class="literal">pydoc</code> and <code class="literal">help()</code>, most documentation is actually presented in separate string literals at the start of a package, module, class, or function definition. We'll look at these documentation strings in <a class="link" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Fit and Finish – Unit Testing, Packaging, and Documentation">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Fit and Finish – Unit Testing, Packaging, and Documentation</em>. The <code class="literal">#</code> comment is used sparingly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>The Python ecosystem</h1></div></div></div><p>The <a class="indexterm" id="id66"/>Python programming environment has two broad subject areas:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The language itself</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The extension packages. We can further subdivide the extension packages into:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The standard library of packages</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Python ecosystem of yet more extension packages</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>When we install Python, we install the language plus several hundred extension packages in the standard library. We'll return to the standard library in <a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Scripts, Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Applications">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Scripts, Modules, Packages, Libraries, and Applications</em>. The Python ecosystem is potentially infinite. The good news is that PyPI makes it relatively easy to locate packages.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"/>The idea of extensibility via add-ons</h2></div></div></div><p>Python's design<a class="indexterm" id="id67"/> includes a small core language that can be extended by importing additional features. The Language Reference Manual describes 20 statements; there are only 19 operators. The idea is that we can have a great deal of confidence that a small language is correctly implemented, complete, and consistent.</p><p>The standard library documentation contains 37 chapters, and describes hundreds of extension packages. There are a lot of features available to help us solve our unique problem. It's typical to see Python programs that import numerous packages from the standard library.</p><p>We'll see<a class="indexterm" id="id68"/> two common variations of the <code class="literal">import</code> statement:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">import math</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">from math import sqrt, sin</code></li></ul></div><p>The first version imports the entire <code class="literal">math</code> module and creates the module as an object in the global namespace. The various classes and function names within that module must be properly qualified with the namespace to be used. A qualified name will look similar to <code class="literal">math.sqrt()</code> or <code class="literal">math.sin()</code>.</p><p>While<a class="indexterm" id="id69"/> the second version also imports the <code class="literal">math</code> module, it only introduces the given names into the global namespace. These names do not require qualifiers. We can use <code class="literal">sqrt()</code> and <code class="literal">sin()</code> as if they were built-in functions. The <code class="literal">math</code> module object, however, is not available, since it was not introduced into the global namespace.</p><p>An import happens exactly once. Python tracks the imported modules and will not import a module a second time. This allows us to freely import modules as needed without worrying about the order or other obscure dependencies among modules.</p><p>For confirmation of this one-time-only rule for imports, try the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; import this
&gt;&gt;&gt; import this</pre></div><p>The behavior the second time is different because the module has already been imported once.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"/>Using the Python Package Index – PyPI</h2></div></div></div><p>Many developers of Python modules will register their <a class="indexterm" id="id70"/>work with the PyPI. This is located at <a class="ulink" href="http://pypi.python.org/">http://pypi.python.org/</a>. This<a class="indexterm" id="id71"/> is the second place to look for a module that might help <a class="indexterm" id="id72"/>solve a particular problem.</p><p>The first place to look is always the standard library.</p><p>The PyPI web page has a handy search form as well as a browser that shows packages organized under nine different metadata variables. In many cases, a book or blog post may provide a direct path like this: <a class="ulink" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx/1.3b2">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx/1.3b2</a>. This ensures that the proper version can be downloaded and installed.</p><p>There are three common ways to download and install software from the PyPI:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using <code class="literal">pip</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using <code class="literal">easy_install</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Manually</li></ul></div><p>Generally, we'll use tools such as <code class="literal">pip</code> or <code class="literal">easy_install</code> for almost all of our installations. Once in a while, however, we may need to resort to a manual installation.</p><p>Some modules may involve binary extensions to Python. These are generally C-language-sources, so they must be compiled to be useful. For Windows—where C compilers are rare—it's often necessary to find an <code class="literal">.msi</code> installer that includes prebuilt binaries. For Mac OS X and Linux, the C source may be compiled as part of the installation process.</p><p>In the<a class="indexterm" id="id73"/> case of large, complex numeric and scientific<a class="indexterm" id="id74"/> packages—specifically, <code class="literal">numpy</code> and <code class="literal">scipy</code>—the build process can become quite complex: generally, more complex than <code class="literal">pip</code> or <code class="literal">easy_install</code> can handle. There are many additional high-performance libraries for these packages; the builds include modules in FORTRAN as well as C. In this case, a prebuilt OS-specific distribution is used; <code class="literal">pip</code> isn't part of the process.</p><p>Installing additional packages will require administrator privileges. Consequently, we'll show the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command as a reminder that this is required for Mac OS X and Linux. Windows users can simply ignore the presence of the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03"/>Using pip to gather modules</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">pip</code> program is part of Python 3.4. It's an add-on for Python3. To use <code class="literal">pip</code> to install a package, we <a class="indexterm" id="id75"/>generally use a command such as the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>For Mac OS X or Linux, we need to use the <code class="literal">sudo</code> command so that we have administrator privileges.

A Mac OS X user with the built-in Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 can generally use the default <code class="literal">pip</code> command without any problems because there won't be a version of <code class="literal">pip</code> configured for Python 2.</p><p>In the case where someone has Python 3.3 and Python 3.4, and has installed <code class="literal">pip</code> for Python 3.3, they will have to choose which version they want to work with.

The default <code class="literal">pip</code> command may link to whichever version was installed last-something we shouldn't guess at.</p><p>The <code class="literal">pip</code> program has a number of additional features to uninstall packages and track which packages have been added to the initial Python installation.

What this means is that Python—the abstract language—can be processed by a variety of concrete Python runtimes or implementations. The CPython implementation is written in portable C and can be recompiled for many operating systems.</p><p>Python can be embedded into an application. This means that a complex application can include the entire Python language as a way to write scripts that customize the given application. One <a class="indexterm" id="id81"/>example of this is the Ganglia monitoring system (<a class="ulink" href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net">http://ganglia.sourceforge.net</a>). Python is part of the system; we can customize the behavior using Python scripts that will interact with Ganglia components. We won't be looking more deeply into these kinds of applications in this book; we'll focus on standalone implementations of Python.</p><p>There are several alternative Python implementations. In the <em>Installing Python on Windows</em> section<a class="indexterm" id="id82"/> in this chapter, we noted that Iron Python (<a class="ulink" href="http://ironpython.net">http://ironpython.net</a>) and PTVS (<a class="ulink" href="http://pytools.codeplex.com">http://pytools.codeplex.com</a>) are available.

This can provide significant performance improvements for a variety of long-running applications, such as web servers.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Stackless</strong>: This <a class="indexterm" id="id88"/>version of Python has a different threading model from CPython.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec14"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>We've looked at installing or upgrading Python so that we can work with version 3.3 or 3.4, and we've looked briefly at the minor differences between Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The principle difference among the OS variants is that Windows lacks Python, whereas Mac OS X and Linux generally have a version of Python already installed. There are few other differences among the operating systems.</p><p>We've looked at some basic interactions using the REPL. We looked at some simple expressions and the built-in <code class="literal">help()</code> subsystem.</p><p>We've looked at some ways that the <code class="literal">import</code> statement extends the basic capabilities of our Python runtime environment, and we've also introduced the larger Python ecosystem. We can add to our Python library using the <code class="literal">pip</code> (and <code class="literal">easy_install</code>) tool. The PyPI is the central repository for most of the Python extension modules.</p><p>In the next chapter, we'll look at Python's numeric types in detail. Python numbers form a kind of "tower" that follows the mathematical notions of integer, rational, real, and complex numbers. We'll look at the mathematical operators and some of the standard libraries for working with numbers.</p><p>We'll also look at some of the more complex data types available, including/alongside specific tuples, strings, and frozensets. These are relatively simple because they are immutable. As is the case with ordinary numbers, the values of these more complex objects don't change either.</p></div></body></html>

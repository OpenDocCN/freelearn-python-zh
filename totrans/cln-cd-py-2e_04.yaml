    (in general, a class) must have only one responsibility. The fact that the class
    has a sole responsibility means that it is in charge of doing just one concrete
    thing, and as a consequence of that, we can conclude that it must have only one
    reason to change.

- en: 'Only if one thing on the domain problem changes will the class have to be updated.
    If we have to make modifications to a class for different reasons, it means the
    abstraction is incorrect, and that the class has too many responsibilities. This
    is probably an indication that there is at least one abstraction missing: more
    objects need to be created to address the extra responsibility that''s overloading
    the current class in question.'

  zh: 只有当领域问题中的某个事物发生变化时，类才需要更新。如果我们必须因为不同原因对类进行修改，这意味着抽象是不正确的，并且该类有太多的职责。这可能是至少缺少一个抽象的迹象：需要创建更多的对象来处理当前类所承受的额外职责。
- en: As introduced in *Chapter 2*, *Pythonic Code*, this design principle helps us
    build more cohesive abstractions—objects that do one thing, and just one thing,
    well, following the Unix philosophy. What we want to avoid in all cases is having
    objects with multiple responsibilities (often called **God objects**, because
    they know too much, or more than they should). These objects group different (mostly
    unrelated) behaviors, thus making them harder to maintain.

  zh: 如在第2章*Pythonic代码*中所述，这个设计原则帮助我们构建更内聚的抽象——只做一件事，并且做得很好，遵循Unix哲学。我们希望避免所有情况下都有多个职责的对象（通常称为**上帝对象**，因为它们知道太多，或者比应该知道的还多）。这些对象组合了不同的（大多数是无关的）行为，这使得它们更难维护。

- en: The SRP is closely related to the idea of cohesion in software design, which
    we already explored in *Chapter 3*, *General Traits of Good Code*, when we discussed
    the separation of concerns in software. What we strive to achieve here is that
    classes are designed in such a way that most of their properties and their attributes
    are used by their methods, most of the time. When this happens, we know they are
    related concepts, and therefore it makes sense to group them under the same abstraction.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: SRP与软件设计中的内聚性概念密切相关，我们已经在*第3章*，*良好代码的一般特性*中探讨了软件的关注点分离。我们在这里努力实现的是，类的设计方式使得它们的大部分属性和属性通常由其方法使用。当这种情况发生时，我们知道它们是相关概念，因此将它们归入同一抽象之下是有意义的。
- en: In a way, this idea is somewhat analogous to the concept of normalization in
    relational database design. When we detect that there are partitions on the attributes
    or methods of the interface of an object, they might as well be moved somewhere
    else—it is a sign that they are two or more different abstractions mixed into
    one.

  zh: 从某种意义上说，这个想法与关系数据库设计中的规范化概念有些类似。当我们检测到对象的属性或方法接口上有分区时，它们可能最好被移动到其他地方——这是它们被混合成一个的多个不同抽象的迹象。
- en: There is another way of looking at this principle. If, when looking at a class,
    we find methods that are mutually exclusive and do not relate to each other, they
    are the different responsibilities that have to be broken down into smaller classes.

    If we need to change something (for example, we want to change the data structure

    rest, and all of them have a clear and specific meaning. If we need to change
    something in how we load events from the data sources, the alert system is not
    even aware of these changes, so we do not have to modify anything on the system

    be an interface, but for the purposes of this section, that detail is not relevant
    and will be explained later for the next principles). This would make sense, whereas
    it would not have made sense in the previous design, because attempts to reuse
    the only class we had defined would have also carried extra methods (such as `identify_events()`
    or `stream_events()`) that were not needed at all.

    can anticipate that this will not end well, and that you need to separate responsibilities.

    might collide (for example, we might have a proper abstraction that provides closure
    against a requirement but does not work for other types of requirements). In these
    cases, we need to be selective and apply a strategy that provides the best closure
    for the types of requirements that require being the most extensible.

    what ultimately defines the essence of the object are the methods it has. The

    responsible for implementing. This is useful in situations where we want to make

    example, and considering the previous principle exposed (LSP), if we have a generic
    `Event` class, we don't want to use that class itself (because by its own it doesn't
    mean anything), so we probably want to deal with one of the actual events (the
    subclasses, like `LoginEvent`, for example). In this case we could define `Event`
    as an abstract base class, to make this explicit. Then the system monitor works
    with a type of event, and the `Event` class acts like an interface (as a way of
    saying "any object that has this kind of behavior"). We can go further and decide
    that the default implementation of the `meets_condition` method is not enough
    (or that sometimes, an implementation can't be provided by the interface), and
    force each derived class to implement it. For this, we would use an `@abstractmethod`
    decorator.

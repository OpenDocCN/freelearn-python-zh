- en: Today, organizations encounter an ever-increasing delivery frequency problem.
    The days of delivering a new version every few years are long gone. The test-driven
    development process enables individuals and teams to deliver code that is not
    only robust but maintainable as well. Combine this with the rapid development
    speed of the Python language and you have a combination that enables the delivery
    of new features at the pace demanded by the market.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Test-Driven Development"),
    *Getting Started with Test-Driven Development*, is the introductory chapter. It
    eases you into the TDD process by setting the context of why we need TDD and quickly
    getting started with a test.'

    – The TDD Cycle*, goes deeper into the TDD process, driving the implementation
    of our example project as we write more tests.'

    and Refactoring*, explores common types of smelly code, and we go back to our
    example project and clean up the smells we find. A key benefit of TDD is that
    it provides a safety net so that we can go in and clean up messy code.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Using Mock Objects to Test Interactions"),
    *Using Mock Objects to Test Interactions*, shows the use of mocking to implement
    the parts of our example project that depend on other systems. How do you test
    code that depends on external subsystems? We answer that question here by introducing
    mock objects.'

    Legacy Code*, is about the fact that we often need to clean up or add features
    to old code that doesn''t have existing tests. This chapter looks at strategies
    for doing this by working through one of the modules in our sample application.'

    Your Test Suite*, proves that unit tests are also code and good coding practices
    apply to test code as well. This means keeping them well organized and easy to
    maintain. This chapter covers techniques to do just that.'

    covers some other patterns for unit testing. We see how to speed up tests and
    how we can run specific subsets of tests. We also take a look at data-driven tests
    and mocking patterns.'

    and trial, are test runners with some unique features.'

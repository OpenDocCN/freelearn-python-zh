    "Chapter 1. Starting with the Basics"), *Starting with the Basics*, starts with
    a discussion of the two core principles that this book focuses on: how Salt uses
    Python and how the Loader system works. These form the foundation of extending
    Salt.'

    "Chapter 2. Writing Execution Modules"), *Writing Execution Modules*, explains
    that the heavy lifting in most of Salt is performed by execution modules, which
    are often wrapped by other modules. A solid understanding of execution modules
    will also be key to understanding how other module types work.'

    "Chapter 3. Extending Salt Configuration"), *Extending Salt Configuration*, explains
    that the ability to dynamically manage configuration can make some modules far
    more useful. Some modules won''t even work without dynamic configuration. Here,
    we explore different ways to provide that.'

    "Chapter 4. Wrapping States Around Execution Modules"), *Wrapping States Around
    Modules*, supports the fact that execution modules make things work, but state
    modules make that work persist. In this chapter, you will see how to manage execution
    modules using state modules.'

    "Chapter 5. Rendering Data"), *Rendering Data*, shows that the renderer system
    allows you to add your own templating systems, increasing the power of states.
    Jinja and YAML are all well and good, but sometimes, you need something more.'

    "Chapter 6. Handling Return Data"), *Handling Return Data*, answers the query
    what happens to the data when a job finishes. There are many places it can go,
    and you can write modules to send it there.'

    "Chapter 7. Scripting with Runners"), *Scripting with Runners*, shows that SaltStack
    knows that system administrators have used scripting languages for years, and
    they have provided a scripting environment that combines Python with the raw power
    of Salt.'

    not to just serve files from Salt Master. You can serve files from wherever you
    want with your own external file server module.'

    out how you can update existing cloud modules or add your own. Everyone uses the
    cloud now, and Salt Cloud connects it to Salt.'

    solve the problem that Salt isn''t normally associated with monitoring, which
    is a shame. Beacons are one way to integrate Salt into your monitoring framework.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes a reasonable amount of knowledge of both Salt and the Python
    programming language. While you may be able to slam out some code without much
    experience (indeed, that is how the author got started with both), you will find
    it much easier with these tools already under your belt.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While the examples in this book are tested and functional, they may not be applicable
    to your needs. They are designed to be simple and easily understood by one who
    is comfortable with both Python and Salt, while still showcasing a reasonably
    amount of functionality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Salt currently has a baseline of Python 2.6, which means that many older Linux
    distributions are still supported. As of the first edition of this book, Salt
    does not currently run on the Python 3.x branch. Minion-side examples are expected
    to work in Windows as well, except when the dependencies that they rely on aren't
    available.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because both the Master and the Minion can be run on the same machine, you only
    need one computer to perform the examples in this book. Many of the examples do
    refer to software that may not be preinstalled with your operating system. In
    those cases, the software should still be available for download.

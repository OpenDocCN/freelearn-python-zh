- en: All praises be to God! I am glad that this book is now published, and I would
    like to thank everyone behind the publication of this book. This book is an exploratory
    guide to network programming in Python. It has touched a wide range of networking
    protocols such as TCP/UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, CGI, and so forth.
    With the power and interactivity of Python, it brings joy and fun to develop various
    scripts for performing real-world tasks on network and system administration,
    web application development, interacting with your local and remote network, low-level
    network packet capture and analysis, and so on. The primary focus of this book
    is to give you a hands-on experience on the topics covered. So, this book covers
    less theory, but it's packed with practical materials.

- en: This book is written with a "devops" mindset where a developer is also more
    or less in charge of operation, that is, deploying the application and managing
    various aspects of it, such as remote server administration, monitoring, scaling-up,
    and optimizing for better performance. This book introduces you to a bunch of
    open-source, third-party Python libraries, which are awesome to use in various
    usecases. I use many of these libraries on a daily basis to enjoy automating my
    devops tasks. For example, I use Fabric for automating software deployment tasks
    and other libraries for other purposes, such as, searching things on the Internet,
    screen-scraping, or sending an e-mail from a Python script.

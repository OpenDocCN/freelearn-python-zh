<p>The Raspberry Pi Zero is sold by distributors such as the <strong>Newark element14</strong>, <strong>Pi Hut</strong>, and <strong>Adafruit</strong>. At the time of writing this book, we encountered difficulties in buying a Raspberry Pi Zero. We recommend monitoring websites such as <a href="http://www.whereismypizero.com">www.whereismypizero.com</a> to find out when the Raspberry Pi Zero becomes available. We believe that it is rare to locate the Pi Zero because of its popularity. We are not aware if there might be an abundant stock of the Raspberry Pi Zero in the future. The examples discussed in this book are also compatible with the other flavors of the Raspberry Pi (for example, Raspberry Pi 3).</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Zero is a small computer that costs about $5 and smaller than a credit card, designed by the <strong>Raspberry Pi Foundation</strong> (a nonprofit organization with the mission to teach computer science to students, especially those who lack of access to the requisite tools). The Raspberry Pi Zero was preceded by the <strong>Raspberry Pi Models A and  B</strong>. A detailed history of the Raspberry Pi and the different models of the Raspberry Pi is available on <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_General_History"><span class="URLPACKT">http://elinux.org/RPi_General_History</span></a>. The Raspberry Pi Zero was released on 26th November 2015 (<em>Thanksgiving Day</em>).</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">A fun fact for the readers is that one of the authors of this book, Sai Yamanoor, drove from San Francisco to Los Angeles (700+ miles for a round trip in one day) on the day after Thanksgiving to buy the Raspberry Pi Zero from a local store.</div>

                <h1 class="header-title">The features of the Raspberry Pi Zero</h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>The Raspberry Pi Zero is powered by a 1 GHz BCM2835 processor and 512 MB RAM. BCM2835 is a <strong>System on a Chip</strong> (<strong>SoC</strong>) developed by Broadcom semiconductors. SoC is one where all the components required to run a computer are available on a single chip (for example, the BCM2835 includes CPU, GPU, peripherals such as USB interface). The documentation for the BCM2835 SoC is available at <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2835/README.md"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2835/README.md</span></a>.</p>
<div class="packt_figure packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="321" src="assets/image_01_003.png" width="532"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">The Raspberry Pi Zero board version 1.3</div>
<p>Let's briefly discuss the features of the Raspberry Pi Zero using the preceding picture marked with numbered rectangles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The mini HDMI interface</strong>: The mini HDMI interface is used to connect a display to the Raspberry Pi Zero. The HDMI interface can be used to drive a display of maximum resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.</li>
<li><strong>USB On-The-Go interface</strong>: In the interest of keeping things low cost, the Raspberry Pi Zero comes with a USB <strong>On-The-Group</strong> (<strong>OTG</strong>) interface. This interface enables interfacing USB devices such as a mouse and keyboard. Using a USB OTG to USB-A female converter. We need a USB hub to interface any USB accessory.</li>
<li><strong>Power supply</strong>: The micro-B USB adapter is used to power the Raspberry Pi zero, and it draws about a maximum of 200 mA of current.</li>
<li><strong>micro SD card slot</strong>: The Raspberry Pi's <strong>operating system</strong> (<strong>OS</strong>) resides in a micro SD card and the <strong>bootloader</strong> on the processor loads it upon powering up.</li>
<li><strong>GPIO interface</strong>: The Raspberry Pi Zero comes with a 40-pin <strong>general purpose input/output</strong> (<strong>GPIO</strong>) header that is arranged in two rows of 20 pins. The Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO interface is shipped without a soldered header. The GPIO header is used to interface sensors, control actuators, and interface appliances. The GPIO header also consists of communication interfaces such as UART and I<span>2</span>C. We will discuss the GPIO in detail in the second chapter.</li>
<li><strong>RUN and TV pins</strong>: There are two pins labeled as <strong>RUN</strong> below the GPIO header. These pins are used to reset the Raspberry Pi using a small tactile switch/push button. The <strong>TV</strong> pin is used to provide a composite video output.</li>
<li><strong>Camera interface</strong>: Raspberry Pi Zero boards (version 1.3 or higher) come with a camera interface. This enables interfacing a camera designed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/</span></a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>All these features of the Raspberry Pi have enabled them to be used by hobbyists in projects involving home automation, holiday decorations, and more, limited only by your imagination. Scientists have used them in experiments, including tracking of bees, tracking wildlife, perform computation-intensive experiments. Engineers have used the Raspberry Pi to build robots, mine bitcoins, check Internet speeds to send Twitter messages when the speeds are slow, and order pizza!</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In this book, we will discuss the different aspects of Python programming using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The Raspberry Pi Zero ships without the GPIO header pins. Let's go ahead and solder the GPIO pins. We have also uploaded a video tutorials to this book's website that demonstrates soldering the headers onto the Raspberry Pi Zero.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the Raspberry Pi's GPIO section consists of 40 pins. This is arranged in two rows of 20 pins each. We will need either two sets of 20-pin male headers or a 20-pin double-row male header. These are available from vendors such as <strong>Digikey</strong> and <strong>Mouser</strong>. The headers for the Raspberry Pi are also sold as a kit by vendors like the Pi Hut (<a href="https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-zero/products/raspberry-pi-zero-essential-kit"><span class="URLPACKT">https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-zero/products/raspberry-pi-zero-essential-kit</span></a>).</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">2x20 headers for the Raspberry Pi Zero</div>
<p>In order to solder the headers onto the Raspberry Pi Zero, arrange the headers on a breadboard, as shown in the following figure:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><img class=" image-border" height="429" src="assets/image_01_005.png" width="322"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Arranging the headers to solder onto the Raspberry Pi</div>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrange the Raspberry Pi on top of the headers upside down.</li>
<li>Gently hold the Raspberry Pi (to make sure that the headers are positioned correctly while soldering) and solder the headers onto the Raspberry Pi.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Inspect the board to ensure that the headers are soldered properly and carefully remove the Raspberry Pi Zero off the breadboard.</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="468" src="assets/image_01_006.png" width="351"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Headers soldered onto the Raspberry Pi</div>
<p>We are all set to make use of the GPIO pins in this book! Let's move on to the next section.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Soldering the headers onto the Raspberry Pi using a breadboard might damage the breadboard if the right temperature setting isn't used. The metal contacts of the breadboard might permanently expand resulting in permanent damage. Training in basic soldering techniques is crucial, and there are plenty of tutorials on this topic.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>Setting up a Raspberry Pi zero inside an enclosure is completely optional but definitely useful while working on your projects. There are a plenty of enclosures sold by vendors. Alternatively, you may download an enclosure design from <strong>Thingiverse</strong> and 3D print them. We found this enclosure to suit our needs at <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1203246"><span class="URLPACKT">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1203246</span></a> as it provides access to the GPIO headers. 3D printing services such as <strong>3D Hubs</strong> (<a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/">https://www.3dhubs.com/</a>) would print the enclosure for a charge of $9 via a local printer. Alternately, you can also use predesigned project enclosures or design one that can be constructed using <strong>plexiglass</strong> or similar materials.</p>

<p>Let's go ahead and prepare a micro SD card to set up the Raspberry Pi Zero. In this book, we will be working with the <strong>Raspbian OS</strong>. The Raspbian OS has a wide user base, and the OS is officially supported by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Hence, it is easier to find support on forums while working on projects as more people are familiar with the OS.</p>

<p>Python is a high-level programming language invented by Guido Van Rossum. It is advantageous to learn Python using the Raspberry Pi for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a very simple syntax and hence is very easy to understand.</li>
<li>It offers the flexibility of implementing ideas as a sequence of scripts. This is helpful to hobbyists to implement their ideas.</li>
<li>There are Python libraries for the Raspberry Pi's GPIO. This enables easy interfacing of sensors/appliances with the Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>Python is used in a wide range of applications by technology giants such as Google. These applications range from simple robots to personal AI assistance and control modules in space.</li>
<li>The Raspberry Pi has a growing fan base. This combined with the vast user base of Python means that there is no scarcity of learning resources or support for projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, we will learn Python version 3.x. We will learn each major aspect of Python programming using a demonstrative example. Find out the awesomeness of Python by learning to do things by yourself! Keep in mind that there is Python 2.x, and it has subtle differences from Python 3.x.</p>

<p>Since we are done setting up the Raspberry Pi, let's get things rolling by writing our first piece of code in Python. While learning a new programming language, it is customary to get started by printing <kbd>Hello World</kbd> on the computer screen. Let's print the following message: <kbd>I am excited to learn Python programming with the Raspberry Pi Zero</kbd> using Python.</p>
<p>In this book, we will learn Python using the <strong>Integrated Development and Learning Environment</strong> (<strong>IDLE</strong>) tool. We chose IDLE for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tool is installed and shipped as a package in the Raspbian OS image. No additional installation is required.</li>
<li>It is equipped with an interactive tool that enables performing checks on a piece of code or a specific feature of the Python language.</li>
<li>It comes with a text editor that enables writing code according to the conventions of the Python programming language. The text editor provides a color code for different elements of a Python script. This helps in writing a Python script with relative ease.</li>
<li>The tool enables a step-by-step execution of any code sample and identify problems in it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we get started, let's go ahead and set up the Raspberry Pi Zero to suit our needs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let's add a shortcut to IDLE3 (for developing in Python 3.x) on the Raspberry Pi's desktop. Under the Programming <span>submenu (located at the top-left corner of your Raspberry Pi Zero's desktop), right-click on</span> <span class="packt_screen">Python 3 (I<span class="packt_screen">DLE)</span></span><span> and click on</span> <span class="packt_screen">Add to desktop</span><span>. This adds a shortcut to the IDLE tool on your desktop thus making it easily accessible.</span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>In order to save all the code samples, let's go ahead and create a folder named <kbd>code_samples</kbd> <span>on the Raspberry Pi's desktop. Right-click on your desktop and create a new folder.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Let's write our first example using IDLE's interactive tool:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the IDLE3 (meant for Python 3.x) tool from the Raspberry Pi Zero's desktop by double-clicking on it.</li>
<li>From the IDLE's interactive command-line tool, type the following line:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
       print("I am excited to learn Python with the Raspberry Pi Zero")
</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>This should print the following to the interactive command-line tool's screen:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class=" image-border" height="97" src="assets/image_01_016.png" width="509"/></div>
<p>We did it! We wrote a single line that prints out a line of text to the Raspberry Pi's screen.</p>

<p>The command-line tool is useful for test coding logic, but it is neither practical nor elegant to write code using the interactive tool. It is easier to write a bunch of code at a time and test it. Let's repeat the same example using IDLE's text editor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch IDLE's text editor (in IDLE, <span class="packt_screen">File</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New File</span>), enter the <kbd>hello world</kbd> line discussed in the previous section and save it as <kbd>helloworld.py</kbd>.</li>
<li>Now, the code could be executed by either pressing the <em><span class="KeyPACKT">F5</span></em> <span>key or clicking on</span> <span class="packt_screen">Run </span><span class="packt_screen">Module</span> <span>from the drop-down menu</span> <span class="packt_screen">Run</span><span>, and you will get the output as shown in the following figure:</span></li>

<p>It is also possible to use the Python interpreter via the <strong>Linux Terminal</strong>. Programmers mostly use this to test their code or refer to the Python documentation tool, <strong>pydoc</strong>. This approach is convenient if the readers plan to use a text editor other than IDLE:</p>

<li>Launch the Raspberry Pi's command-line terminal from the desktop toolbar.</li>

<li>Now, try running the same piece of code discussed in the previous section:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
       print("I am excited to learn Python with the Raspberry Pi Zero")

            <article>
                
<p>It is possible to execute code written using any text editor via the Linux Terminal. For example, Let's say the file <kbd>helloworld.py</kbd> is saved in a folder named <kbd>code_samples</kbd> on the Raspberry Pi's desktop. This file may be executed as follows from the Linux Terminal:</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">If you are not familiar with the Linux command-line terminal, we have written up some tutorials to familiarize yourself with the command-line terminal on this book's website.</div>
<ol>
<li>On the Linux Terminal, switch to the directory where the Python script is located:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
       <strong>cd /home/pi/Desktop/code_samples</strong>
</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Execute the Python script as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
       <strong>python3 helloworld.py</strong>
</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Alternatively, the Python script could be executed using its absolute location path:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
       <strong>python3 /home/pi/Desktop/code_samples/hello_world.py</strong>
</pre>
<p>We did it! We just wrote our first piece of code and discussed different ways to execute the code.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>In our first <kbd>helloworld</kbd> example, we discussed printing something on the screen. We used the <kbd>print()</kbd> function to obtain our result. In Python, a <strong>function</strong> is a code block that executes a set of defined tasks. The <kbd>print()</kbd> function is a part of Python's standard library that prints any combination of alphanumeric characters that is passed as an argument between the quotes. The <kbd>print()</kbd> function is used to print information to the screen. It is especially helpful while trying to debug the code. In this example, the <kbd>print()</kbd> function was used to print a message on the screen.</p>
<p>In this chapter, the function <kbd>print()</kbd> executed the string <kbd>I am excited to learn Python programming with the Raspberry Pi Zero</kbd> (we will discuss strings in the later section of this book). It is also possible to write custom function to execute a repetitive task required by the user.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <kbd>exit()</kbd> function executes the predefined task of exiting the Python interpreter at the user's call.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>While getting started, it is going to be difficult to remember the syntax of every function in Python. It is possible to refer to a function's documentation and syntax using the help function in Python. For example, in order to find the use of the print function in Python, we can call help on the command-line terminal or the interactive shell as follows:</p>
<pre>
    help(print)
</pre>
<p>This would return a detailed description of the function and its syntax:</p>

<p>That's it! In this chapter, we set up the Raspberry Pi Zero to write our first program in Python. We also explored different options to write a Python program. You are now ready and on your way to learn Python with the Raspberry Pi. In the next chapter, we will dig deeper and learn more about the GPIO pins while executing a simple project that makes LEDs blink.</p>

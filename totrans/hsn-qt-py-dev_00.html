<p class="mce-root"><span>Qt is one of the most widely used and flexible frameworks for GUI application development. This book will introduce you to the development of Python-based Qt GUI applications with Python bindings such as PyQt and PySide. We will start by describing PyQt and PySide GUI elements, and this will be used as a reference for the rest of the book. On completion of the book, you will be able to create beautiful Python GUI applications from scratch.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>You can download </span>and<span> install the PySide2 binding from the Qt official source by following the instructions, or you can install it from </span><strong>PyPI</strong><span> (</span><strong>Python Package Index</strong><span>) through </span><kbd>pip</kbd>."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root">...<br/>class UApp(UTools):<br/><br/>    def __init__(self):<br/>        UTools.__init__(self)<br/>        self.uaps1 = "I am a coder, and I do"</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>import "Path/To/JavaScript/File" as <strong>Identifier</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root"><strong>&gt; pip install PyQt5</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Choose a template | Application | Qt Quick Application - Empty</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Choose...</span>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>

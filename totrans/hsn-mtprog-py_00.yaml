- en: Effective and reusable code makes your application development process seamless
    and easily maintainable. With Python, you have access to advanced metaprogramming
    features that you can use to build high-performing applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book starts by introducing you to the need for and applications of metaprogramming,
    before navigating the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. As you progress,
    you will learn about simple decorators, then work with meta classes, and later
    focus on introspection and reflection.

- en: After that, you will understand your code using abstract syntax trees and explore
    method resolution order. This book also shows you how to create your own dynamic
    objects before structuring the objects through design patterns. Finally, you will
    learn about simple code-generation techniques along with best practices and eventually
    build your own applications.

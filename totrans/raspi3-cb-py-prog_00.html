<p class="mce-root">This book is intended for anyone who wants to build software applications or hardware projects using the Raspberry Pi. The book gradually introduces text classification, creating games, 3D graphics, and sentiment analysis. We also move towards more advanced topics, such as building computer vision applications, robots, and neural network applications. It would be ideal to have basic understanding of Python; however, all programming concepts are explained in detail. All the examples are written using Python 3, with clear and detailed explanations of how everything works so that you can adapt and use all the information in your own projects. By the end of the book, you will have the skills you need to build innovative software applications and hardware projects using the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> </p>
<p>"<span>We use the </span><kbd>bind</kbd><span> function here, which will bind a specific event that occurs on this widget (</span><kbd>the_canvas</kbd><span>) to a specific action or key press.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python3 
# bouncingball.py 
import tkinter as TK 
import time 
 
VERT,HOREZ=0,1 
xTOP,yTOP = 0,1 
xBTM,yBTM = 2,3 
MAX_WIDTH,MAX_HEIGHT = 640,480 
xSTART,ySTART = 100,200 
BALL_SIZE=20 
RUNNING=True </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo nano /boot/config.txt</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Pair</span> button to begin the pairing process and enter the device's <span class="packt_screen">PIN</span></span>.<span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>

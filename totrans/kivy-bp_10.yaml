    about Kivy, or exemplify every remotely possible approach to writing a Kivy app;
    it should instead serve as a practical, hands-on introduction to writing various
    programs with a user interface in Python.

- en: Kivy's major achievement is bridging the gap between a Python toolchain and
    mobile app development on Android and iOS. Unlike bindings to Qt (PyQt and PySide),
    Kivy is inherently Pythonic (apart from minor implementation details such as the
    `Window` object). These two aspects alone make Kivy a viable option to consider
    when writing your next user-facing application.

- en: This notwithstanding, I strongly encourage you to explore the vast Python ecosystem.
    It just so happens that a great many Python modules manage to stay under the radar.
    Kivy is actually one of them, overshadowed by, for example, the relatively more
    popular Qt framework (they clearly don't belong in the same ballpark, but a common
    misconception is that these are mostly interchangeable, for reasons unclear).

    Recorder for Android"), *Sound Recorder for Android*, this module provides a seamless
    and relatively lightweight Java interoperability layer. This tool lets you reuse
    any Java library, on Android and desktop, from the comfort of your Python environment.
    Needless to say, Java libraries (of equivocal usefulness) come in great numbers,
    so Pyjnius may prove useful on many occasions.'

    this particular use case is popular with governments these days. Might land you

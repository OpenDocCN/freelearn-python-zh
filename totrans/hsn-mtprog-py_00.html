<p>Effective and reusable code makes your application development process seamless and easily maintainable. With Python, you have access to advanced metaprogramming features that you can use to build high-performing applications.</p>
<p>This book starts by introducing you to the need for and applications of metaprogramming, before navigating the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. As you progress, you will learn about simple decorators, then work with meta classes, and later focus on introspection and reflection.</p>
<p>You will also delve into generics and typing, before defining templates for algorithms.</p>
<p>After that, you will understand your code using abstract syntax trees and explore method resolution order. This book also shows you how to create your own dynamic objects before structuring the objects through design patterns. Finally, you will learn about simple code-generation techniques along with best practices and eventually build your own applications.</p>
<p>By the end of this learning journey, you will have the skills and confidence you need to design and build reusable high-performing applications that can solve real-world problems.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>If you are an intermediate-level Python programmer looking to enhance your coding skills by developing reusable and advanced frameworks, this book is for you. Basic knowledge of Python programming will help you get the most out of this learning journey.</p>

You learned how design patterns work together to solve a real-world design problem. We went further to explore the Model-View-Controller design pattern—the king of Compound patterns. We understood that the MVC pattern is used when we need loose coupling between components and separation of the way in which data is stored from the way data is presented. We also went through the UML diagram of the MVC pattern and read about how the individual components (model, view, and controller) work among themselves. We also saw how it's applied in the real world with the help of the Python implementation. We discussed the benefits of the MVC pattern, learned more about it in the FAQs section, and summarized the discussion at the end of chapter.</p><p class="calibre6">In this chapter, we will talk about AntiPatterns. This is different from all the other chapters in the book; here, we will cover what we shouldn't do as architects or software engineers. We will understand what AntiPatterns are and how they are visible in software design or development aspects with the help of theoretical and practical examples.</p><p class="calibre6">In brief, we will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">An introduction to AntiPatterns</li><li class="listitem">AntiPatterns with examples</li><li class="listitem">Common pitfalls during development</li></ul></div><p class="calibre6">At the end of the chapter, we will summarize the entire discussion—consider this as a takeaway.</p></div>

What does this mean? Let's say that you come across a software design problem. You get down to solving this problem. However, what if the solution has a negative impact on the design or causes any performance issues in the application? Hence, AntiPatterns are common defective processes and implementations within software applications.</p><p class="calibre6">AntiPatterns may<a id="id276" class="calibre1"/> be the result of the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">A developer not knowing the software development practices</li><li class="listitem">A developer not applying design patterns in the correct context</li></ul></div><p class="calibre6">AntiPatterns <a id="id277" class="calibre1"/>can prove beneficial as they provide an opportunity for the following reasons:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Recognize recurring problems in the software industry and provide a detailed remedy for most of these issues</li><li class="listitem">Develop tools to recognize these problems and determine the underlying causes</li><li class="listitem">Describe the measures that can be taken at several levels of improving the application and architecture </li></ul></div><p class="calibre6">AntiPatterns<a id="id278" class="calibre1"/> can be classified under two main categories:</p><div class="book"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Software development AntiPatterns</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Software architecture AntiPatterns</li></ol><div class="calibre17"/></div></div></div>

- en: So far, we have understood what the serverless paradigm is, and also how serverless
    systems work. We have also understood how AWS Lambda's serverless tool works.
    We have also learned the basics of how triggers work in AWS Lambda as well as
    a detailed understanding of the system settings and configuration available to
    the user in the Lambda environment. We have also learned how the Lambda console
    works, and also how to identify and use various parts of the Lambda console in
    detail, including code deployment, trigger manipulation, deploying tests in the
    console, versioning our Lambda function, and also the different settings available.

    triggers available for AWS Lambda and how you can use them to set up efficient
    Lambda architectures. You will also understand what an event structure is, and
    what an event structure looks like for some AWS resources, and how you can use
    that knowledge to write and deploy better trigger-based Lambda architectures.

    work, and how to configure them, set up the triggers, and write Lambda function
    code to handle the data from them.

- en: In the first task, we learned how S3 events work and how to understand and receive
    events from the S3 service to AWS Lambda. We have understood how to monitor S3
    buckets for file details via their metrics in CloudWatch and then send that notification
    via AWS SNS to a Lambda functions.

    route between several metrics of AWS services from CloudWatch to AWS Lambda.

- en: We have learned briefly about how AWS CloudWatch works. We understood what the
    metrics of various AWS services, such as S3, SQS, and CloudWatch, look like. We
    also learned how to set thresholds for CloudWatch Alarms, and how to connect those
    alarms to notification services, such as AWS SNS.

- en: We learned how AWS CloudWatch Logs work and how to connect and use the CloudWatch
    trigger in Lambda so it's triggered whenever a new log event is added/received.
    Overall, we have successfully created new AWS services, such as SQS, CloudWatch
    Logs, SNS, and S3 buckets in this chapter, and successfully built and deployed
    three serverless tasks/pipelines.

    will perform some tasks just like we did in this chapter, and get a hands-on understanding
    of how APIs work and, most importantly, how serverless APIs work.

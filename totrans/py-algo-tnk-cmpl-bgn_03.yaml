  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keywords, variables, functions/methods, and arguments are sometimes shown within
    the text of a paragraph. When they are, the special text is shown in a typeface
    different from that of the rest of the paragraph. For instance, firstName = 5
    is an example of a Python statement within the paragraph text.

- en: Words in Italics
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may notice that some of the special text is also displayed in italics. In
    this book, italicized words are general types that must be replaced with the specific
    name appropriate for your data. For example, the general form of a Python statement
    may be presented as
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'def name(arg1, arg2):'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to complete the statement, the keywords name, arg1, and arg2 must be
    replaced with something meaningful. When you use this statement in your program,
    you might use it in the following form
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'def displayRectangle(width, height):'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Three dots (…): an Ellipsis'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the general form of a statement you may also notice three dots ( … ), also
    known as an “ellipsis”, following a list in an example. They are not part of the
    statement. An ellipsis indicates that you can have as many items in the list as
    you want. For example, the ellipsis in the general form of the statement

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: displayMessages(arg1, arg2, … )
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    statement in your program, your statement might be something like this.

- en: Square Brackets in Italics
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The general form of some statements or subprograms may contain “square brackets”
    [ ] in italics, which indicate that the enclosed section is optional. For example,
    the general form of the statement

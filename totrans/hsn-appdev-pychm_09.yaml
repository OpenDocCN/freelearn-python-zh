    Python in a landscape of traditional web development frameworks designed to generate
    content on the server and send it back to the browser. This is how we have developed
    web applications for decades. The 2010s brought a paradigm shift, but it didn’t
    happen overnight.

    was coined by Jesse James Garrett in an article titled *Ajax: A New Approach to
    Web Applications*. This article helped popularize the concept and techniques of
    asynchronous web applications. By 2005, mainstream browsers all supported a new
    **XMLHttpRequest** (**XHR**) web API call. The feature allowed a developer to
    request pure data instead of a generated HTML page with the data integrated with
    markup.'

    associated with the advancement of JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS (now
    Angular), React, and Vue.js. These provided developers with the tools and capabilities
    to build dynamic, interactive web applications differently from traditional applications,
    which make requests for HTML and data at the same time. SPAs load all their markup,
    CSS, and JavaScript in a single request. After that, the app uses XHR to request
    data, and in response to the data received and the user’s interactions, the developer
    used JavaScript to show and hide different elements in the user experience rather
    than re-rendering the entire page each time there was a change in data or a user
    interaction.

- en: 'The interesting thing about FastAPI is the way it handles web requests. Most
    products, including Flask, use a worker model. A pool of workers is responsible
    for servicing multiple incoming requests on separate processes managed by the
    operating system. FastAPI uses an **asynchronous programming** model. In the realm
    of asynchronous programming, functions are invoked, but the immediate return of
    outcomes is not guaranteed. Let’s explore the following illustrative Python code:'
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: FastAPI最有趣的地方在于它处理Web请求的方式。大多数产品，包括Flask，都使用工作模型。一群工作进程负责在操作系统管理的不同进程中服务多个传入请求。FastAPI使用**异步编程**模型。在异步编程领域，函数会被调用，但并不保证立即返回结果。让我们来探索以下具有说明性的Python代码：

- en: When calling `add_two` in a synchronous programming context, the execution thread
    halts until the function is completed and the outcome is furnished. However, the
    mechanics differ when employing asynchronous programming. An asynchronous invocation
    doesn’t halt the invoking thread. Instead, the calling thread persists in execution
    after obtaining a `a + b` once this computation has been executed. It’s important
    to acknowledge that this may not happen instantaneously, but during the computation,
    other operations remain unblocked. Naturally, performing an addition of integers
    is likely to conclude swiftly.
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在同步编程环境中调用`add_two`时，执行线程会暂停，直到函数完成并返回结果。然而，当使用异步编程时，机制会有所不同。异步调用不会停止调用线程。相反，在执行完计算`a
    + b`后，调用线程会继续执行。重要的是要认识到，这可能不会立即发生，但在计算过程中，其他操作不会被阻塞。当然，执行整数的加法运算很可能会迅速完成。
- en: Consider an alternative scenario where a request is made to a networked resource,
    such as fetching a web page. The speed of response is no longer solely contingent
    on the processor’s execution speed. It encompasses factors such as computer performance,
    network latency, and various other elements that might introduce delays ranging
    from seconds to even minutes. This is particularly true for those who don’t reside
    in well-connected urban areas with high-speed internet access. Since the asynchronous
    software doesn’t block, it can serve many requests serially since none of them
    are waiting for the previous function call or, in this case, web request, to finish.
    You can think of it as a restaurant with one waiter. You submit your order serially
    with other diners, but the cook only returns your food when it has been cooked.
    With this expectation set, the cook is free to cook as many dishes at once as
    their stove allows, and there is an implicit promise given that once your food
    is cooked, the waiter will bring it to you. Someone who orders a glass of juice
    might get their order back immediately, whereas your baked Alaska will take a
    little longer to produce.
  id: totrans-13

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A synchronous restaurant, by contrast, would employ, say, eight cooks. Eight
    orders can come in at once, but each cook is completely dedicated to fixing that
    one order until it is complete. As it turns out, the throughput, at least for
    computers, is often faster when employing the asynchronous model for typical web
    request workloads.

- en: In Python 3.4, we got a new module called `asyncio`, which brought asynchronous
    programming features to our favorite language. Three years later, we found the
    first GitHub commit to a library project called **Starlette**. Starlette is an
    asynchronous web framework for building high-performance applications with Python.
    It provides the core functionality for handling HTTP requests and responses in
    an efficient manner. Starlette is known for its simplicity, speed, and support
    for modern Python features, making it an ideal foundation for building web applications.
    Like Werkzeug, though, which powers Flask, Starlette was only meant to be a foundation.
    This chapter covers **FastAPI**, a framework built on top of Starlette that represents
    a full implementation of a web framework specializing in the development of **RESTful
    Application Programming Interfaces** (**REST APIs**) Where Flask used a worker
    model, FastAPI uses an asynchronous model, and where Flask was designed to create
    traditional round trip, template-driven content generation, FastAPI normally used
    the SPAs to handle serving data in the form of **JavaScript Object** **Notation**
    (**JSON**).

    of FastAPI. Line 6 shows us how FastAPI decorates endpoints. `@app` comes from
    the instantiation on line 3 and we’re invoking the HTTP `GET` method here so requests
    coming in using that method will be received and processed. If a client makes
    a request using another HTTP verb such as `PUT` or `POST`, they’ll receive an
    error since, currently, there is no code to handle that HTTP method.

    development server. This is because FastAPI runs in an application called `uvicorn`,
    which is a variant of Green Unicorn (`gunicorn`). Uvicorn is production ready,
    so there is no warning. You can develop using the same application server software
    you will use when you deploy your application to your customers. The difference
    between `uvicorn` and `gunicorn`, which is most often used as a production server
    for Flask applications, is that `uvicorn` handles the async programming model
    while `gunicorn` uses traditional workers, as described earlier in this chapter.

    so you needn’t set up your own servers if that’s not your thing. Team City, though,

    have a domain name server resolving a nice test domain name for your app. You
    probably won’t be using port `8000` since that would not be very production-like.

    you don’t, PyCharm will become quite cross! Just stare at the majesty for a moment.
    Take it all in. What we have here is a test. WRITTEN IN JAVASCRIPT! I’m sorry.
    I should have warned you to sit down or something. I did, however, mention that
    beer was involved. There is some magic here. There is a `client` object inherent
    in this test window, not unlike the `window` object that is ever-present in a
    browser window. We’re invoking the `.test` method on that client object and we’re
    passing it two arguments. The first is a string that describes the test. This
    can be anything you’d like. The contents do not affect the test in any way. The
    second argument is an anonymous function that actually executes the test. If you’re
    not up on JavaScript’s use of lambda-style functions, you’re just going to have
    to roll with it and copy these tests from examples. I suppose you could also go
    learn JavaScript, but that might take a while. Thankfully, the `client.assert`
    part seems like the tests we wrote in [*Chapter 6*](B19644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145),
    *Seamless Testing, Debugging, and Profiling*, so let’s keep going. The assert
    takes an expression that will evaluate to true or false. JavaScript uses a triple
    equals sign for testing equality without coercion. If you have not heard of this,
    for now, just know you should always be using three equals signs because using
    two means something else and you don’t want that. A double equals sign, which
    is the norm in Python, might yield a false failure in your JavaScript test code
    because JavaScript will attempt to force any data types it encounters to match.
    The triple equals avoid this.

    Visual Studio, and I usually advise my students to install Node.js manually, rather
    than have an IDE do it. In general, the IDEs often don’t point to the latest release
    of Node.js. I can see in *Figure 9**.27* that PyCharm intends to install 16.16.0,
    which isn’t the latest. Besides, looking at the right version, I further recommend
    you use the latest **long-term support** (**LTS**) version of Node.js rather than
    the version with the highest version number. The LTS product is guaranteed stable,
    whereas the absolute newest version isn’t.

    to use a package manager such as **Chocolately** ([https://chocolatey.org/](https://chocolatey.org/))
    or **Homebrew** ([https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)). Package managers are standard
    affairs on Linux, and every distribution uses their own, so if you’re using Linux,
    I’ll assume you know which one you need. The reason I advocate using package managers
    for installing Node.js is that the package manager makes it very easy to update,
    or even fully remove, your software should you ever need to. If you want to try
    out Homebrew for Mac, there is a short, free course on my website that teaches
    you to set up an Apple computer for Node.js development. You can find it at [https://www.maddevskilz.com/courses/setting-up-a-nodejs-development-workstation-in-macos](https://www.maddevskilz.com/courses/setting-up-a-nodejs-development-workstation-in-macos).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FastAPI is distinct from Flask, and many other template-oriented web development
    frameworks, in that it is specifically designed to create only RESTful APIs. A
    RESTful API is a backend that is decoupled from any frontend markup, layout, interactivity,
    or display logic. Instead, the API focuses solely on receiving requests bearing
    user interaction data and returning processed data, such as that retrieved or
    processed in a relational database.

    used to serve as the frontend presentation layer. A number of modern frameworks
    support this paradigm, including React, Angular, and Vue. It is the frontend application’s
    job to control the application state since HTTP is a stateless protocol, and any
    backend would be ill suited to this responsibility.

- en: Creating the FastAPI project was easy using the template built into PyCharm
    Professional. It generated starting code as well as a special type of test file
    unique to PyCharm. The HTTP file contains a specification for a request, and a
    testing framework based on JavaScript, which allows us to validate the response
    with the same kind of assertion logic we saw in our earlier exposure to unit testing.

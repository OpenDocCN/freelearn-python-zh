- en: The evolution of software means that, over time, systems grow to be more and
    more complex, and require more and more developers working on them in a coordinated
    fashion. As the size increases, a general structure arises from there. This structure,
    if not well planned, can become really chaotic and difficult to work with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The challenge of software architecture is to plan and design this structure.
    A well-designed architecture makes different teams able to interact with each
    other while at the same time having a clear understanding of their own responsibilities
    and their goals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The architecture of a system should be designed in a way that day-to-day software
    development is possible with minimal resistance, allowing for adding features
    and expanding the system. The architecture in a live system is also always in
    flux, and can be adjusted and expanded as well, reshaping the different software
    elements in a deliberate and smooth fashion.

    the top level to some of the lower-level details that support the higher view.
    The book is structured in four sections, covering all the different aspects in
    the life cycle:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for software developers that want to expand their knowledge of
    software architecture, whether experienced developers that want to expand and
    solidify their intuitions about complex systems, or less experienced developers
    who want to learn and grow their abilities, facing bigger systems with a broader
    view.

    to be an expert, some basic knowledge of Python is advisable.

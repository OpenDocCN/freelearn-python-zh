<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0018.html#H5A40-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre16">The Serverless Paradigm</em>, <span class="calibre11">introduces the reader to the concepts of microservices and serverless architectures, and provides a clear understanding of the pros and cons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0024.html#MSDG0-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre16">Building a Serverless Application in AWS</em>, covers<span class="calibre11"> AWS Lambda and explains the concepts, workings, and the components involved in the tool in detail. It also explains the nuances involved in security, user controls, and versioning code inside Lambda.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0033.html#VF2I0-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre16">Setting Up Serverless Architectures</em>, <span class="calibre11">goes into further detail about the various triggers in AWS Lambda and how they integrate with the functions. The reader will learn what the event structure of each trigger will look like and how to modify the Lambda function with respect to the type of trigger used.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0039.html#1565U0-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre16">Deploying Serverless APIs</em>, explores the<span class="calibre11"> AWS API Gateway and also teaches the reader how to build efficient, scalable serverless APIs using the API Gateway and Lambda. It goes on to teach the reader how to improve the API by adding authorization and how to set up user-level controls such as throttling of requests.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0045.html#1AT9A0-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre16">Logging and Monitoring</em>, presents<span class="calibre11"> the concept of logging and monitoring in serverless applications. This is mostly still an unsolved problem in this domain. This chapter guides the reader through setting up logging and monitoring in the AWS environment with Python via custom metrics and logging. This chapter also goes into the details of best practices when it comes to logging and monitoring Lambda functions in Python.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0052.html#1HIT80-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre16">Scaling Up Serverless Architectures</em>, <span class="calibre11">discusses the practice of scaling up serverless architectures for large workloads using several third-party tools. This chapter also teaches the reader how to handle security, logging, and monitoring using the available Python modules.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0058.html#1NA0K0-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 7</a>, <em class="calibre16">Security in AWS Lambda</em>, teaches readers to d<span class="calibre11">eploy secure serverless applications by leveraging the AWS security features available. This involves having strict controls on components that the application can access, on the users who can handle or access the application, and so on. This also involves understanding AWS virtual private clouds and subnets for an in-depth understanding of the security features and best practices you can follow in AWS Lambda.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0065.html#1TVKI0-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 8</a>, <em class="calibre16">Deploying a Lambda Function with SAM</em>, looks at how to d<span class="calibre11">eploy Lambda functions as infrastructure as code via the Serverless Application Model, which is a new way of writing and deploying Lambda functions that makes it easier to integrate with other IaaS services, such as CloudFormation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="part0071.html#23MNU0-549599642d7c49468fd0a78166faf963" class="calibre8">Chapter 9</a>, <em class="calibre16">Introduction to Microsoft Azure Functions</em>, familiarizes<span class="calibre11"> the reader with Microsoft Azure Functions, and explains how to configure and understand the components of the tool.</span></p>

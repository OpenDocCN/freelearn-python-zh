- en: Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range
    of technical tasks—computation, statistics, data analysis, game development, and
    more. Though Python is easy to learn, its range of features means there are many
    aspects of it that even experienced Python developers don't know about. Even if
    you're confident with the basics, its logic and syntax, by digging deeper you
    can work much more effectively with Python—and get more from the language.

- en: '*Python Unlocked* walks you through the most effective techniques and best
    practices for high performance Python programming—showing you how to make the
    most of the Python language. You''ll get to know objects and functions inside
    and out, and will learn how to use them to your advantage in your programming
    projects. You will also find out how to work with a range of design patterns,
    including abstract factory, singleton, and the strategy pattern, all of which
    will help make programming with Python much more efficient. As the process of
    writing a program is never complete without testing it, you will learn to test
    threaded applications and run parallel tests.'

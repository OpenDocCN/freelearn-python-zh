<em>Tkinter GUI Application Development Hotshot</em> is a step-by-step guide that will walk you through the process of developing real-world graphical applications using Python and Tkinter; the built-in GUI module of Python.</p><p>This book attempts to highlight features and capabilities of Tkinter, while demonstrating a few of the myriad ways you can use Tkinter to develop exciting, fun, and useful pieces of GUI applications with Tkinter and Python.</p><p>We hope to take you on a fun journey through more than 10 projects from different problem domains. As we develop new applications in each project, the book also builds up a catalogue of some commonly used strategies for developing real-world applications.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Meet Tkinter">Project 1</a>, <em>Meet Tkinter</em>, begins from scratch, providing an overview of Tkinter covering details on how to create root windows, how to add widgets to a root window, how to handle layout with geometry managers, and how to work with events.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Making a Text Editor like Notepad">Project 2</a>, <em>Make a Text Editor like Notepad</em>, develops a text editor in procedural style of programming. It gives the reader their first taste of several features of Tkinter and what it is like to develop a real application.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Programmable Drum Machine">Project 3</a>, <em>Programmable Drum Machine</em>, uses object-oriented programming to develop a drum machine capable of playing user composed rhythms. The application can also save those compositions and later edit or replay them. Here, you also learn to write multithreaded GUI applications.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Game of Chess">Project 4</a>, <em>Game of Chess</em>, develops a game of chess, introducing key aspects of structuring a GUI application as a model-view program. It also teaches the art of taking a real-world object (chess), and modeling it in notations that your program can manipulate. It also introduces the reader to the power of Tkinter Canvas widget.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Audio Player">Project 5</a>, <em>Audio Player</em>, takes up the task of building an audio player. This project introduces the concepts of working with external libraries while showing you how to work with many different Tkinter widgets.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Drawing an Application">Project 6</a>, <em>Drawing an Application</em>, develops a drawing and graphic editor. This project also shows how to develop and work with a GUI framework, thereby creating reusable code for all of your future programs.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Some Fun Project Ideas">Project 7</a>, <em>Some Fun Project Ideas</em>, works through a series of small but functional projects, demonstrating problems from different domains such as network programming, database programming, graphing, basic animation, and multithreaded programming.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Miscellaneous Tips">Appendix A</a>, <em>Miscellaneous Tips</em>, discusses some vital aspects of GUI programming not covered in previous projects, but form a common theme in many GUI programs.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. Quick Reference Sheets">Appendix B</a>, <em>Quick Reference Sheets</em>, lists down a handy reference sheet of all Tkinter and ttk options and methods along with a brief description on their input, usage, and output.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>The programs discussed in this book have been developed on Windows platform. However given the multi-platform abilities of Tkinter, you can easily work along on other platforms such as Linux distributions or Mac OS.</p><p>The following software is required for this book:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Python 2.7 version with Tkinter 8.5 included in the distribution</li></ul></div><p>The link to download and install other project specific modules and software are mentioned in the respective projects.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book assumes that you are familiar with Python programming language, at a beginner level. However, a motivated Python newbie with a background in writing programs can fill in gaps in knowledge with a little outside research.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <code class="literal">include</code> directive."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">from Tkinter import *
class MyFirstGUI():
  def __init__(self):
    self.root = Tk()
    self.root.mainloop()
if __name__ == '__main__':
app = MyFirstGUI()</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">from Tkinter import *
class MyFirstGUI():
  def __init__(self):
    self.root = Tk()
    <strong>self.root.mainloop()</strong>
if __name__ == '__main__':
app = MyFirstGUI()</pre></div><p>Any input on Python interactive shell is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&gt;&gt;&gt; import Tkinter 
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(Tkinter.Label)</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important</strong> words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "When a user specifies a new number and clicks on the <strong>Update Record</strong> button it calls a method."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>

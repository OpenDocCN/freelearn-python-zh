- en: We continue our journey by learning the advanced concepts of the Python language
    in this section. This includes a refresher of some concepts for you with an introduction
    to advanced subjects such as iterators, generators, errors, and exception handling.
    This will help you to move to the next level of programming in Python. In addition
    to writing Python programs, we also explore how to write and automate unit tests
    and integration tests using test frameworks such as unittest and pytest. In the
    last part of this section, we discuss some advanced function concepts for data
    transformation and building decorators in Python, and how to use data structures
    including pandas DataFrames for analytics applications.

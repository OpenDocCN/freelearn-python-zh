- en: Every secret agent needs a good set of tools and gadgets. When an agent's missions
    involve gathering data, high-powered data processing is required. This book will
    provide you with the kinds of information processing tools that will help you
    gather, analyze, and communicate the data that the HQ demands.

- en: Python allows agents to write simple scripts to gather data, perform sophisticated
    calculations, and produce useful results. Agents can also use Python to extract
    data from local files, HTTP web servers, and FTP file servers.

- en: 'Python has numerous add-on packages. This book will explore just two: Pillow
    allows for sophisticated image conversion and manipulation, and BeautifulSoup
    allows an agent to extract data from HTML web pages. Agents with specific needs
    might have to explore the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Numeric Python
    (NumPy), or even Scientific Python (SciPy).'

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Our Espionage Toolkit"), *Our Espionage Toolkit*,
    exposes the basics of installing and using Python. We''ll write scripts to help
    agents work with foreign currency conversions and learn how an agent can recover
    a lost password from a ZIP archive.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Acquiring Intelligence Data"), *Acquiring
    Intelligence Data*, shows how we can use Python to extract information from various
    kinds of file servers. Agents will learn how to work with different Internet protocols
    and use Representational State Transfer (REST) to interact with web services.
    This will include techniques to work with cyptocurrencies, such as bitcoins.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Encoding Secret Messages with Steganography"),
    *Encoding Secret Messages with Steganography*, shows how we can add the Pillow
    toolset to work with images. An agent with Pillow can create thumbnails and convert,
    crop, and enhance images. We''ll also explore some steganography algorithms to
    bury our messages in an image file.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Drops, Hideouts, Meetups, and Lairs"), *Drops,
    Hideouts, Meetups, and Lairs*, provides a closer look at geocoding and geolocation.
    This includes the use of web services to convert an address into a latitude and
    longitude. We''ll also learn how to convert a latitude and longitude back into
    an address. We''ll take a look at the haversine formula to get the correct distance
    between locations. We''ll also look at some of the ways in which geographic locations
    can be represented for tidy storage and communication.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. A Spymaster''s More Sensitive Analyses"),
    *A Spymaster''s More Sensitive Analyses*, shows how we can use Python for a basic
    data analysis. A good agent doesn''t just spout facts and figures; a good agent
    does enough analysis to confirm that the data is realistic. Being able to examine
    the correlation between datasets is what creates a valuable intelligence asset.'

    suite of developer tools that are common. The Gnu C Compiler (GCC) is the backbone
    of these tools.

- en: For agents using Mac OS X, the developer tool, Xcode ([https://developer.apple.com/xcode/](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)),
    is required. We'll also need to install a tool called homebrew ([http://brew.sh](http://brew.sh))
    to help us add the Linux packages to Mac OS X.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for secret agents who don't know much Python, but are comfortable
    installing new software and are ready to do some clever programming in Python.
    An agent who has never done any programming before might find some of this a bit
    advanced; a beginner's tutorial that covers the basics of Python may be helpful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll expect that an agent using this book is comfortable with simple math.
    This involves the multiplication and division of currency conversions. It also
    includes polynomials, simple trigonometry, and a few statistical formulae.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also expect the secret agents using this book to be doing their own investigations.
    The book's examples are designed to get the agent started down the road with developing
    interesting, useful applications. Each agent will have to explore further afield
    on their own.

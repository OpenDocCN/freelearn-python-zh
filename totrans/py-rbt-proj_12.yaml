    you whenever you are around. It is one of the most basic things that any system

    inside the room, thereafter, we will make the system more and more intelligent.

    not. There are multiple ways to do that. One important characteristic of life
    is the presence of movement. You may say plants don't move, well they do; they
    grow, don't they? So detecting movement can be a key step in detecting whether
    someone is there or not!

    time the motion is there. What does that mean? Simple, while there is some movement,
    will keep the lights on and as soon as the movement stops, it will switch off
    the light.

    it will remain on for 5 minutes. Then, it will switch off and wait for movement
    to occur. So, essentially, the problem with this code will be that if you are
    in the room and the light switches on, then for 5 minutes it will see if there
    is any motion detected or not. There is a chance that you will be in motion when
    it searches for the motion after 5 minutes. But for most of the time, it won't
    be the case. So we are detecting the movement using the PIR sensor. Whenever movement
    is detected, the value of `M_final` is incremented using the line `M_final = M_final
    + 1`, thereby increasing the time until which the light will be switched on.

    of `0.1` seconds using the `time.sleep(0.1)` function. Thereafter, we are taking
    the reading from the same sensor again and storing the value in a variable called

    **Sensor 2** would be triggered. Hence, the time noted would be greater for **Sensor
    2** and relatively earlier for **Sensor 1**. If that happens, then we can assume
    that the person is coming inside. Well, if a person is coming inside, then we
    simply need to switch the light on, which is exactly what we are doing here.

    other air circulation systems. Whenever we talk about fans or any other air circulation
    devices, then essentially we are talking about motors. As we have learned earlier,
    motors are simple devices, which can be controlled every easily using a motor
    driver. But as you know, back then we were controlling DC motors. DC motors are
    extremely simple devices. But when we talk about our household appliances, then
    most of these devices will be working on AC or alternating current. I am assuming
    that you must be aware of what that is and how it is different from DC.
  prefs: []

    you must also think about the fact that their control mechanism will be much different
    to DC motors. You are right, if you thought so. However, the good thing about
    electronics is, nothing is really difficult or complicated. The basics are pretty
    much the same. So, let's see how we can control the speed of the motors in AC
    supply.

    The thing is, yes it can be done if you want to control a light or similar devices,
    which do not have any major change in the characteristics in case the wave form
    is distorted. However, when we are talking about any other component, then we
    come across a big problem. The AC wave form looks like this:'

    with the phase of the AC power; however, due to this, only the positive end of
    the phase is being transferred to the final output and not the negative end. This
    will cause a severe problem to our load and there is a very good chance that the
    appliance that is connected will not work.

    of the wave pass by. In this, we can clearly see that randomly any part of the
    wave is being transferred and the positive and negative end voltage is not in
    sync, which again will be a huge problem. Hence, instead of using PWM, we use
    something really interesting.

    the AC nature of the power supply while still being able to reduce the overall
    resulting voltage. Likewise, as you can see in the next diagram, the wave is getting

    by a relatively complex circuit that detects the phase angle of the wave and then
    opens or controls a triac, which is a high power bi-directional semiconductor.
    This leads the power supply to pass or to be stopped at certain phases. We will
    leave the exact working of this circuit for the next time as it is fairly complex
    and will not be relevant to this book.

    your body temperature starts to dip reaching its lowest point around 4:00-6:00
    am in the morning. That's the reason why what might feel warm while you go to
    bed, can be pretty cold when you wake up. Modern air-conditioners have something

    relay. As you can see, the relay can handle only 250V and 5 ampere. Now, if you
    go through the brochure of your air-conditioner, you will easily understand why
    I am showing all of this to you. The power consumption of the air-conditioner
    will be much higher than what your relays can handle. So, if you try to run your
    air conditioner using the normal relays, then you will surely end up blowing the
    relay. There might be a chance that your appliance will be of a lower current
    rating than your relay. But with any device that has motors in it just keep in
    mind that the initial power consumption of that device is much higher than the
    nominal power consumption. Hence, if your air-conditioner needs 10 ampere nominal,
    then the starting load may be as much as 15 ampere. You must be thinking, it''s
    not a problem, why don''t we just purchase a relay that has a higher rating. Well,
    correct! That''s exactly what we will be doing. But the naming of electronics
    can be tricky at times. The devices that deal with a higher-power higher-voltage
    electro-mechanical switching is generally called contractor instead of relay.
    Technically, they have the same working principal; However, there are construction
    differences, which at this point would not be our concern. So we will be using
    a contractor for the air conditioner switching and a dimmer for the fan speed

    will be incremented by `10`. Therefore, we are sending the PWM to the AC dimmer,
    which in turn will increase the speed of the fan. Finally, we are resetting the
    value of `Movement` to `0`.

    is counted only if the temperature is less than 28° C. If the movement is more
    than `5`, then we will increase the speed of the fan by 10%.

    and `58`, that is, the time in which the counting will happen. When the value
    of `M` is `59`, then the condition `if Movement = 0` will be checked, and if true,
    then the value of `Duty` will be decremented by `10`. This in turn will reduce
    the speed of the fan by 10%. Also, once this condition is executed, the value
    of `Movement` will be reset to `0`. So then a new cycle can start for the next
    hour.

    If the `Movement` is more than `5` then immediately the value of the `Duty` would
    be increased. However, if that is not the case, then the program will wait until
    the minute approaches the value of `59` and whenever that happens, it will check
    whether there is any movement, in which case, the fan speed will be decreased.

    then the AC will be switched off. Furthermore, if the temperature is equal to
    or more than `24`, and time is between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., then the AC will
    be turned on. Finally, if the temperature is more than `27`, then the fan will
    be switch on to 100% speed.

    during this time the AC is always switched off. Also, if `H = 20`, then the AC
    should be turned on so that the room is cooled before you are ready to sleep.

    as per our needs. We have understood switching and have also perfected the way
    we can vary the intensity of light and the speed of fans. But did you notice one
    thing? Sooner or later as our system gets more and more complex, the number of
    GPIOs needed will increase. There will come a moment when you will want to have
    more and more devices connected to your Raspberry Pi; however, you will not be
    able to do so due to lack of physical ports.

    for this problem as well. This solution is known as a multiplexer. The basic job
    of a multiplexer is to multiply the number of ports in any computer system. Now
    you must be thinking, how is it able to do so?

    being the signal output lines and the other opposite to it. The first thing we
    need to understand is that the multiplexer is a bidirectional device, that is,
    it sends the data from the multiplexer to the connected devices and also vice
    versa.

    power up the multiplexer itself. Then, we have **Signal Lines**, which have two
    ports, the **Sig** and **EN**. **EN** stands for enable, which means that until
    the time **EN** is not high, the data communication will not happen either way.
    Then we have something called **Sig**. This is the port that is connected to the
    GPIO of Raspberry Pi for data communication. Next we have the selection line.
    As you can see, we have four ports for it, namely, **S0**, **S1**, **S2**, and **S3**.
    The selection lines have a purpose of selecting a particular port that needs to
    be selected. The following is a table that will clarify what exactly is happening:'

    on the selection lines, various lines can be addressed. Let's say, for example,
    we have the following sequence on the selection pins—S0 = 1, S1 = 0, S2 = 1, S3
    = 1\. If this is the input on the selection pins from Raspberry Pi, then the pin
    number C13 will be selected. This basically means that now C13 can communicate
    the data to and from the pin **Sig** for the multiplexer. Also, we must remember
    that the enable pin must be high for the data transfer to happen.

    Hence, if we see it logically, then by using six pins of Raspberry Pi, we can
    go ahead and utilize 16 GPIOs. Now that we have understood the basics of multiplexing,
    let's go ahead and try using one of them.

    one to address every single port where the LED is connected. Whenever that happens,
    the LED corresponding to it glows. Also, the reason it glows is because the signal
    port `Sig` is connected to 3.3V of Raspberry Pi. Hence, send a logic high to whichever
    port it is connected to.

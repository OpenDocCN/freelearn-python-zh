			<h1 id="_idParaDest-171" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor184" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Useful Resources and Project Ideas</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">In this final chapter, you will learn about <strong class="bold">FastAPI, React, and MongoDB</strong> (<strong class="bold">FARM</strong>) stack components and some recommended actions to understand the technologies that make up this flexible stack.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">For building data-driven or data-intensive applications, this chapter provides some practical advice when working with the FARM stack, along with project ideas where the FARM stack, or very similar stacks, could be applicable and helpful. You will also learn how to find your way in the constantly changing web development and analytics fields. This will be helpful for those who come from the most diverse backgrounds, but their jobs or newfound passion drives them to find a path through the data-driven world.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">This chapter will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17">MongoDB considerations</li>
				<li class="calibre17">FastAPI and Python considerations</li>
				<li class="calibre17">React practices</li>
				<li class="calibre17">Beginner project ideas</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-172" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor185" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>MongoDB considerations</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">In <a href="B22406_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Setting Up the Database with MongoDB</em>, you were introduced to MongoDB to get you started with simpler projects. However, MongoDB is a complex ecosystem employed by enterprise-level companies. Therefore, diving deeper into its features and patterns will benefit you as a developer and help you understand the NoSQL paradigm.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">One of the first steps in employing MongoDB is understanding data modeling or schema design. Your data model should reflect how your application will see the data and its flow, starting from the queries you make. There are advanced design patterns that apply to MongoDB schemas that are beyond the scope of this book.</p>
			<p class="calibre5"><a href="B22406_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>,<em class="italic"> Setting Up the Database with MongoDB</em>, covered some popular MongoDB document modeling best practices. The following list provides more tips:</p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17">Objects should be combined in the same document if they are meant to be used together. The quote “<em class="italic">Data that is accessed together, stays together</em>” might inform your schema.</li>
				<li class="calibre17">When separating objects into different documents, try not to make JOINs necessary, although simple LEFT JOINs are possible through the MongoDB aggregation framework.</li>
				<li class="calibre17">The frequency of the data use cases should dictate the schemas. The most frequent data flows should be the easiest to access.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre5">Coming from the relational database world, modeling relationships often boils down to the choice between <strong class="bold">embedding</strong> and <strong class="bold">referencing</strong>. In the simple application you worked on in previous chapters that listed used cars, you opted to reference the user ID when you made the CRUD application with users, since it was the simplest thing to do. </p>
			<p class="calibre5">However, that could probably apply to a real-world setting as well. There are numerous empirical rules. For example, if the many sides of a <em class="italic">one-to-many</em> relationship could contain hundreds of items, embedding is probably not the best way to go.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">The extensive MongoDB documentation states that <strong class="bold">embedding</strong> should be preferred in relationships that are <em class="italic">one-to-one</em>, <em class="italic">one-to-few</em>, and <em class="italic">one-to-many</em>, while <strong class="bold">referencing</strong> should be used in <em class="italic">one-to-very-numerous-many</em> and <em class="italic">many-to-many</em> cases. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">To learn more about the basics of data modeling using real-world examples, check the following documentation: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/mongodb-schema-design-best-practices/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/mongodb-schema-design-best-practices/</a>.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">Additionally, Python drivers such as <strong class="bold">PyMongo</strong> and its async counterpart, <strong class="bold">Motor</strong>, play seamlessly with MongoDB. With the help of rich data structure system and data-processing capabilities of Python, it is relatively easy to change and mix things up, change schemas, and try out different types of documents until you find the optimal solution for your particular use case.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">Here are two interesting projects that could be included in some of your applications: </p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="bold">Beanie</strong> (<a href="https://roman-right.github.io/beanie/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://roman-right.github.io/beanie/</a>) is an Asynchronous Python object-document mapper for MongoDB, based on Motor and Pydantic, that can speed up the creation of CRUD applications. You already learned how to use Beanie for backend development. Please refer to <a href="B22406_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor153" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Third-Party Services Integration with FastAPI </em><em class="italic">and Beanie</em>.</li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="bold">Mongita</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/scottrogowski/mongita" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://github.com/scottrogowski/mongita</a>) can be thought of as SQLite for MongoDB. It could be useful as an embedded database for lighter cases in which you want to keep the data local, or for prototyping even before having to set up MongoDB or Atlas.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-173" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor186" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>FastAPI and Python considerations</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">Python encompasses data and text processing, web development, data science, machine learning, numerical computations, visualizations, and virtually every possible aspect of computing. </p>
			<p class="calibre5">Best practices in Python are applicable to FastAPI as well. However, since FastAPI translates simple Python functions (or even classes, inspired by the class-based views of Django) into REST API endpoints, you don’t have to do anything additional. FastAPI is built in a way that favors the developer, giving you the necessary flexibility and smoothness while writing an API.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">The following list provides generic considerations that should be part of your FastAPI development process:</p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17">Use <strong class="bold">Git</strong> and <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> and learn a simple workflow. It is easier to learn one workflow and use it until you get used to it and then switch, rather than trying to learn all the commands at once, especially if you’re the only developer trying to automate or <em class="italic">REST-ify</em> a business process.</li>
				<li class="calibre17">Keep your environment variables in <code>.env</code> files, but also back them up somewhere (API keys, external services credentials, or elsewhere).</li>
				<li class="calibre17">Learn the type hinting system of Python. It is closely related to Pydantic and adds a layer of robustness to your overall code. It is also an integral part of coding a FastAPI application.</li>
				<li class="calibre17">Structure your application properly. It is very easy and tempting to create a feature-rich application in a single file. This proves true especially if you do not have a clear specification, but you should resist this urge. Refer to the FastAPI documentation on structuring larger applications (<a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications</a>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre5">The main idea is to break the application into routers and Pydantic models, so that they have separate directories. For example, you have a <code>/routers</code> directory in the book, so you should have had a <code>/models</code> directory as well. These directories should each have an empty <code>__init__.py</code> file, making them Python modules. You can keep the external service utilities either in a separate file or in a <code>/helpers</code> directory. You could go granular, depending on the complexity of your app. Remember that you will always end up with an ASGI application that is the only endpoint referenced by your server of choice, such as Uvicorn or another server.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-174" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor187" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Testing FastAPI applications</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">Testing is necessary to ensure that your application behaves the way it is supposed to. This chapter won’t cover <strong class="bold">test-driven development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>), in which tests are written before the actual code. However, there are some specific issues that you may run into when working with the async MongoDB Python driver, called Motor, and FastAPI. </p>
			<p class="calibre5">Unit testing your API is essential and simple to set up. Every endpoint should be tested, and each should perform the tasks they are delegated. While unit testing in Python already has several mature frameworks, such as <code>unittest</code> and <code>pytest</code>, some FastAPI-specific points are worth mentioning.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">The FastAPI documentation (<a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/</a>) recommends that you use the <code>TestClient</code> class provided by Starlette. Francois Voron, in his excellent book <em class="italic">Building Data Science Applications with FastAPI</em>, recommends a slightly more advanced setup using <code>HTTPX</code> (an async HTTP library similar to <code>Requests</code>, developed by the Starlette team) and <code>pytest-asyncio</code>, making the whole process completely asynchronous.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">The inclusion of Pydantic makes the testing of FastAPI applications a pleasant experience and enforces certain practices that tend to produce more stable software. On the other hand, the automatic  documentation of FastAPI is an incredibly helpful tool that saves you time and frequent trips between the code editor and the client.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-175" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor188" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>React practices</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">In <a href="B22406_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor010" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Web Development and the FARM Stack</em>, you chose React for your frontend because of its simplicity and flexibility. If you are a visual learner, try the video course by <em class="italic">Academind GMBH</em> and its main author, Maximilian Schwarzmüller, called <em class="italic">React – The </em><em class="italic">Complete Guide.</em></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Solid knowledge of JavaScript and ES6 is the best foundation for becoming a better React developer, but it is also important to dive a bit deeper into some fundamental React concepts and explore the Hooks mechanism, the component life cycle, and the component hierarchy. </p>
			<p class="calibre5">You should familiarize yourself with other hooks; in this book, you get a glimpse of two or three of the most popular hooks, but there are many more. Knowing how and why hooks work the way they do will make you a better React developer.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">As of 2024, React functional components are generally preferred to older class-based ones as they are more concise, maintainable, and flexible.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-176" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor189" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Other topics</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">This section emphasizes some other important points that would be useful when using the FARM stack. While you can use the FARM stack for virtually any type of web application you choose, the stack might be more suitable for some types of apps and less suitable for others.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-177" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor190" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Authentication and authorization</h2>
			<p class="calibre5"><a href="B22406_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Authentication and Authorization</em>, is dedicated to implementing a JWT-based authentication solution with FastAPI and its consequent application in React. However, as mentioned in that chapter, that might not be the best or a viable solution for certain use cases. You may need to revert to a third-party provider such as Firebase, Auth0, or Cognito. Before committing to a third-party solution, be sure to fully understand the pros and cons, the consequences of a potential lock-in, and the price factor, especially if you are planning to scale the application.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-178" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor191" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Data visualization and the FARM stack</h2>
			<p class="calibre5"><a href="B22406_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor010" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Web Development and the FARM Stack</em>, describes some rather simple visualizations, but with properly formatted and granular JSON responses and React as the frontend, almost anything is possible. This possibility to practically mold the data according to your needs gives you a great playground where you can test, tinker, and try out different solutions, perhaps iteratively, until you reach the type of data visualization that you are satisfied with.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">There is a broad spectrum of visualization requirements, and it isn’t necessary to try and craft a Shirley Wu D3.js piece of art, where a simple two-color stacked run-of-the-mill bar chart could have done the job. However, with the availability of a fast backend and MongoDB accommodating virtually any type of data structure that you might throw at it, you will be ready for any task. The <code>Observable</code> wrapper of D3.js has a very interesting interface and abstracts many of the mechanisms of D3.js, so it might be a good place to start. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-179" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor192" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Relational databases</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">If your use case requires the complexity of relational databases, such as SQL, and their strict structure, you don’t need to abandon the FARM stack altogether. Given the modularity of FastAPI and some of the deployment options that this book explored, you can plug in a relational database, such as Postgres or MySQL, explore the documentation of SQLAlchemy or some async database Python drivers, and simply add said functionality while managing the users, for instance, through MongoDB.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-180" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor193" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Some project ideas to get started</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">This section lists some project ideas to help you explore the possibilities of the FARM stack and hone your skills, but above all, explore your creativity. These sample project ideas will help you explore some functionalities of the FARM stack, like building document automation pipelines, creating data dashboard applications, and building portfolio sites.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-181" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor194" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Old-school portfolio website</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">This project shows how FastAPI, React, and MongoDB are perfectly capable of handling simple portfolio sites that include content such as an <strong class="bold">about</strong> page, service, gallery, contact form, and more. </p>
			<p class="calibre5">The following steps outline how you might create an app for this purpose:</p>
			<ol class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre15">Create a nice design (or try to recreate it in Tailwind CSS).</li>
				<li class="calibre15">Plug in React-Router or Next.js if you want to make it fast.</li>
				<li class="calibre15">Use server-side generation and image optimization. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">For the content, define a couple of Pydantic models: a blog post, portfolio item, article and so on. Then, create simple routes for serving them via <code>GET</code> requests. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">Since this is a developers’ blog, you don’t even need to create an authentication system and <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code> routes: text-related content will be entered directly into MongoDB (Atlas or Compass) and images will go to separate folders on <strong class="bold">Cloudinary</strong>, queried directly through the API. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">Incorporate <strong class="bold">Markdown</strong>, a powerful text preprocessor that converts simple text (Markdown) into valid HTML. Both Python and ES6/React have excellent libraries for handling Markdown, so you will be able to find a good combination.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-182" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor195" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>React-admin inventory</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">Another project idea is to create an inventory system built on top of React-admin (<a href="https://marmelab.com/react-admin/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://marmelab.com/react-admin/</a>), with authentication from Auth0 or Firebase, and a public-facing interface. React-admin provides an admin interface similar to the one used by Django and it is based on CRUD verbs: each resource (or item) that exposes interfaces for <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>GET</code>, and <code>DELETE</code> operations can be edited, deleted, and read and new instances can be created. </p>
			<p class="calibre5">Explore the package and try to think of some type of collection that you may want to manage. There are excellent tools such as <strong class="bold">Airtable</strong> that expose REST APIs that can be called from your FastAPI routes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-183" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor196" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Plotly Dash or Streamlit to create exploratory data analysis applications</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">With Plotly Dash or Streamlit, you can build apps that you can use to play around your data. To see these tools in action, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre15">Pick a dataset that you are familiar with. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">Create an input pipeline that programmatically accepts data and tests it out thoroughly. This data could come from a web or, better, API scraper or from an input file that uploads a JSON or CSV file. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">Clean the data, preprocess it, and insert it into the MongoDB datastore. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">Next, based on the structure of the data, figure out some useful filters and controls, not unlike enterprise tools such as Tableau or Looker Studio. If you’re already familiar with data like that, you will know what to expect.</li>
				<li class="calibre15">After that, you can open up a <strong class="bold">Jupyter</strong> notebook, install a couple of visualization libraries, and see what types of correlations or groupings can come up. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">After you have found some interesting pandas-driven data wranglings, you can just extract them into separate functionalities, test them, and incorporate them into FastAPI endpoints, ready to be visualized with D3.js or Chart.js. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">Finally, you could deploy your application and share it with your friend who manages your team to show them the data backing your draft decisions. </li>
			</ol>
			<p class="calibre5">Earlier, you saw how easy it is to embed a machine learning model built with scikit-learn. Next, you can try embedding a neural network model with Keras or try out some simple linear regression.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Knowledge of data visualization and exploration frameworks such as Streamlit (<a href="https://streamlit.io/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://streamlit.io/</a>) or Dash (<a href="https://dash.plotly.com/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2">https://dash.plotly.com/</a>) will help you in building and deploying your data dashboard applications </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-184" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor197" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>A document automation pipeline</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">Have you always been surrounded by repetitive documents that have the same structure? Here’s what you can do:</p>
			<ol class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre15">Try to think of a document server based on the <code>docx-tpl</code> package, which allows you to define a Word template, formatted as it should be, and then pass a context containing all the data that needs to be in the document, such as text, images, tables, paragraphs, and titles, all while maintaining the initially defined styles. Similar and even more powerful automation can be achieved with Excel. You can use pandas for complex calculations, pivoting, and merging different documents into one. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">After creating the templates, think of some FastAPI endpoints that would perform <code>POST</code> requests and save the posted data to a MongoDB database, along with the data (for instance, the title of the document, the author, the data, or other details), and then trigger a DOCX or XLSX document render. </li>
				<li class="calibre15">Save the file with a recognizable name (maybe by adding the current time or the UUID library, for uniqueness) in a directory and ensure this directory is servable, by FastAPI directly (via the static files functionality). If you plan to have a significant number of heavy documents, even an entire Nginx server block could work.</li>
				<li class="calibre15">These files could then be accessible to all the team members or even sent directly via mail with the cron command-line utility or something similar. </li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-185" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor198" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">This chapter presented some pointers to help you fortify your FARM stack knowledge, as well as provided some project ideas that you could customize and use as a starting point for your own projects. Using them, you can create numerous simple as well as some complex applications to showcase the capabilities and the flexibility of the stack. With regards to what can easily be achieved with the FARM stack, you can also explore other capabilities such as server-side rendering and image optimization with Next.js, send emails, and perform data visualizations.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">FARM stack has a future as the stack of choice for professional development teams and data wranglers or freelancers who just need to tell a story through a web application. By embracing its components, you can build highly interactive and responsive applications tailored to various needs.</p>
			<p class="calibre5">With all the knowledge and hands-on examples you performed throughout this book, you should now be confident in your journey to building fully functional applications using the FARM stack.

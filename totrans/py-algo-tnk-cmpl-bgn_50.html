<h3 id="toc_1">34.1 What Exactly is a Subprogram?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In computer science, a subprogram is a block of statements packaged as a unit that performs a specific task. A subprogram can be called several times within a program, whenever that specific task needs to be performed.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In Python, a built-in function is an example of such a subprogram. Take the well-known abs() function, for example. It consists of a block of statements packaged as a unit under the name “abs”, and it performs a specific task—it returns the absolute value of a number.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>If you are wondering what kind of statements might exist inside the function abs(), here is a possible block of statements.</p>
<div><p>if number &lt; 0:</p>
<p>return number * (-1)</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>return number</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Generally speaking, there are two kinds of subprograms: functions and procedures. The difference between a function and a procedure is that a function returns a result, whereas a procedure doesn't. However, in some computer languages, this distinction may not quite be apparent. There are languages in which a function can also behave as a procedure and return no result, and there are languages in which a procedure can return one or even more than one result.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Depending on the computer language being used, the terms “function” and “procedure” may be different. For example, in Visual Basic you can find them as “functions” and “subprocedures”, in FORTRAN as “functions” and “subroutines”, whereas in Python, the preferred terms are usually “functions” and “void functions”.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">34.2 What is Procedural Programming?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Suppose you were assigned a project to solve the drug abuse problem in your area. One possible approach (which could prove very difficult or even impossible) would be to try to solve this problem by yourself!</p>
<p class="my_basic">A better approach, however, would be to subdivide the large problem into smaller subproblems such as prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation, each of which could be further subdivided into even smaller subproblems, as shown in Figure 34–1.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width38" src="img/chapter34-01.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 34–1 A problem can be subdivided into smaller problems</p>
<p class="my_basic">As the supervisor of this project, you could rent a building and establish within it three departments: the prevention department, with all of its subdepartments; the treatment department, with all of its subdepartments; and the rehabilitation department with all of its subdepartments. Finally, you would hire staff (specialists from a variety of fields), you would build teams and employ them to do the job for you!</p>
<p class="my_basic">Procedural programming does exactly the same thing. It subdivides an initial problem into smaller subproblems, and each subproblem is further subdivided into smaller subproblems. Finally, for each subproblem a small subprogram is written, and the main program (as does the supervisor), calls (employs) each of them to do a different part of the job.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Procedural programming offers several advantages:</p>
<p>►It enables programmers to reuse the same code whenever necessary, without the need for rewriting or copying it.</p>
<p>►It is relatively easy to implement.</p>
<p>►It helps programmers follow the flow of execution more easily, simplifying the debugging process.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>A very large program can prove very difficult to debug and maintain when it is all in one piece. For this reason, it is often easier to subdivide it into smaller subprograms, each of which performs a clearly defined process.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_3">34.3 What is Modular Programming?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In modular programming, subprograms of common functionality can be grouped together into separate modules, and each module can have its own set of data. Therefore, a program can consist of more than one part, and each of those parts (modules) can contain one or more smaller parts (subprograms).</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The math module is such an example. It contains subprograms of common functionality (related to Math), such as fsum(), sqrt(), sin(), cos(), tan(), and many more.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">If you were to use modular programming in the previous drug problem example, then you could have three separate buildings—one to host the prevention department and all of its subdepartments, a second one to host the treatment department and all of its subdepartments, and a third one to host the rehabilitation department and all of its subdepartments (as shown in Figure 34–2). These three buildings could be thought of as three different modules in modular programming, each of which would contain subprograms of common functionality.</p>

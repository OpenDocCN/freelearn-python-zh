<h3 id="toc_1">2.1 What is Python?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level computer programming language that allows programmers to create applications, web pages, and many other types of software.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Python is often referred to as a scripting language despite the fact that the official website says that it's a programming language. The truth, of course, is somewhere in the middle. Python can be used either as a scripting language, or a programming language!</p>
<h3 id="toc_2">2.2 What is the Difference Between a Script and a Program?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Technically speaking, a script is interpreted whereas a program is compiled, but this is actually not their major difference. There is another more important difference between them!</p>
<p class="my_basic">The main purpose of a script written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, or VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is to control another application. So you can say that, in some ways JavaScript controls the web browser, and VBA controls a Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Office application such as MS Word or MS Excel.</p>
<p class="my_basic">On the other hand, a program written in a programming language such as Python, C++, or Java (to name a few) executes independently of any other application. A program is executed as stand-alone any time the user wishes without the need of a hosting application.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Macros of Microsoft Office are scripts written in VBA. Their purpose is to automate certain functions within Microsoft Office.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>A lot of people think that JavaScript is a simplified version of Java but in fact the similarity of the names is just a coincidence.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>A script cannot be executed as stand-alone. It requires a hosting application in order to execute.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">2.3 Why You Should Learn Python</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Python is what is known as a “high-level” computer language. Python's coding style is very easy to understand. It is a flexible and powerful language, making it well-suited for developing medium-scale applications or dynamic web pages. It is the perfect language for teaching programming, especially at the introductory level, and it is widely used in scientific and numerical computing.</p>
<p class="my_basic">One of Python's capabilities is the ability to interact with the file system of a computer. Python can create files, write in files, or read the contents from files. It can also create directories, copy files, delete files, rename files, or even change file attributes. Python can perform almost any task related to the file system, making it suitable even for system administration tasks. For example, you can write a Python program to back up your files or a program that processes text files by reformatting their contents.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Moreover, Python can execute system commands or any other program installed on your system. Thus, programs written and compiled in C, C++, Java, or any other computer language can be executed from Python and Python can make use of their output. This enables you to add functionality to your Python programs without spending time rewriting your old ones.</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are millions—probably even billions—of lines of code already written in Python and your possibilities for code reuse are huge! This is why many people prefer using Python to any other programming language. This is also a very good reason why you should actually learn Python!</p>
<h3 id="toc_4">2.4 How Python Works</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Computers do not understand natural languages such as English or Greek, so you need a computer language such as Python to communicate with them. Python is a very powerful high-level computer language. The Python interpreter (or, actually, a combination of a compiler and an interpreter) converts Python language to a language that computers can actually understand, and that is known as the “machine language”.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In the past, computer languages made use of either an interpreter or a compiler. Nowadays however, many computer languages including Python use both a compiler and an interpreter. The Python compiler translates Python statements into bytecode statements and saves them in a .pyc file. Later, when a user wants to execute the file, the interpreter (often called Python Virtual Machine or Python VM) converts the bytecode into low-level machine language code for direct execution on the hardware.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Python bytecode is a machine language executed by the Python Virtual Machine.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Instead of a compiler and an interpreter, some languages use two compilers. In C#, for example, the first compiler translates C# statements into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL). The CIL code is stored on disk in an executable file called an assembly, typically with an extension of .exe. Later, when a user wants to execute the file, the .NET Framework performs a Just In Time (JIT) compilation to convert the CIL code into low-level machine language code for direct execution on the hardware.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In Figure 2–1 you can see how statements written in Python are compiled into bytecode and how bytecode is then executed using interpretation.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width12" src="img/chapter02-02.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 2–1 Executing Python statements using the Python Virtual Machine</p>
<p class="my_basic">Now come some reasonable questions: Why all this trouble? Why does Python and other languages (such as C#) translate twice? Why are Python statements not directly translated into low-level machine language code? The answer lies in the fact that Python is designed to be a platform-independent programming language. This means that a program is written once but it can be executed on any device, regardless of its operating system or its architecture, as long as the appropriate version of Python is installed on it. In the past, programs had to be recompiled, or even rewritten, for each computer platform. One of the biggest advantages of Python is that you only have to write and compile a program once! In Figure 2–2 you can see how statements written in Python are compiled into bytecode and how bytecode can then be executed on any platform that has the appropriate version of Python installed on it.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width34" src="img/chapter02-01.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 2–2 Executing Python statements on different platforms</p>
<p class="my_basic">Efficiency is another reason why Python statements are not directly translated into low-level machine language code because:</p>
<p>1)Small optimizations can be performed on the intermediate code (bytecode).</p>
<p>2)If a .pyc file with the same name as the .py file you invoke is present, Python automatically executes it. This means that if a .pyc file is present and you haven't made any changes in the source code, Python can save some time by not having to re-compile the source code.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Today few, if any, interpreters really interpret code directly, line by line. Almost all interpreters now use some type of intermediate representation.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">To write and execute Python programs, you need to install two software applications: a Python interpreter and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The IDE is necessary for writing Python programs, while the Python interpreter is required for executing them.</p>
<h3 id="toc_5">2.5 Integrated Development Environments</h3>
<p class="my_basic">An Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, is a type of software that includes all the basic tools programmers need to write and test programs. An IDE typically contains a source code editor and integrates tools such as a compiler or an interpreter, along with a debugger. IDLE and Visual Studio Code are examples of IDEs that let programmers write, execute and debug their source code.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>A “debugger” is a tool that helps programmers to find and correct many of their mistakes.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_6">2.6 IDLE</h3>
<p class="my_basic">IDLE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a very simple environment suitable for beginners, especially in an educational setting. With IDLE, novice programmers can effortlessly write and execute their Python programs.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In Windows, the IDLE module is included by default in the Python installer and will be installed when you follow the steps outlined in the next chapter (<a href="chapter03.html">Chapter 3</a>). Additionally, in <a href="chapter09.html">Chapter 9</a>, you will be guided on how to use IDLE to write, execute and debug Python programs. You will also learn numerous tips and tricks that will be valuable in your first steps as a budding programmer!</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Python and IDLE are included by default in many Linux distributions, but not necessarily in all of them. For example, in Ubuntu Linux, Python is installed by default, but you may need to install the IDLE module separately.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_7">2.7 Microsoft Visual Studio</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Microsoft Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a great set of tools for many programming languages (via extensions installed separately) and lets you easily create applications for Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and the cloud, as well as websites, web applications, and web services.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Visual Studio is much more than a text editor. It can indent lines, match words and brackets, and highlight source code that is written incorrectly. It also provides automatic code (IntelliSense<sup>®</sup>), which means that as you type, it displays a list of possible completions. The IDE also provides hints to help you analyze your code and find any potential problems. It even suggests some simple solutions to fix those problems. You can use the Visual Studio not only to write but also to execute your programs directly from the IDE.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Visual Studio has a large community of users all around the world and this is why it comes in so many different flavors. Specifically, in Microsoft's download page you can download:</p>
<p>►Visual Studio (Community, Professional, or Enterprise), which runs on Windows</p>
<p>►Visual Studio for Mac, which runs on macOS</p>
<p>►Visual Studio Code, which runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux</p>
<p class="my_basic">In the next chapter (<a href="chapter03.html">Chapter 3</a>), you will find links guiding you to instructions on how to install and configure whatever is necessary on your computer, such as the Python interpreter, and IDLE or Visual Studio Code, on either Windows or Linux. Then, in <a href="chapter09.html">Chapter 9</a>, you will discover guidance on using IDLE or Visual Studio Code to write, execute and debug Python programs. These instructions are available on my website. Additionally, you will find numerous tips and tricks there that will be valuable in your first steps as a budding programmer!</p>

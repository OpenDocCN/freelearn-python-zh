<h3 id="toc_1"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">2.1 What is Python?</span></h3>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level computer programming language that allows programmers to create applications, web pages, and many other types of software.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Python is often referred to as a </span><span class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">scripting</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> language despite the fact that the official website says that it's a </span><span class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">programming</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">The truth, of course, is somewhere in the middle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.3">Python can be used either as a scripting language, or a programming language!</span></p>
<h3 id="toc_2"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">2.2 What is the Difference Between a Script and a Program?</span></h3>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Technically speaking, a script is </span><span class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">interpreted</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> whereas a program is </span><span class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">compiled</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">, but this is actually not their major difference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">There is another more important difference between them!</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">The main purpose of a script written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, or VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is to control another application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.2">So you can say that, in some ways JavaScript controls the web browser, and VBA controls a Microsoft</span><sup><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">®</span></sup><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1"> Office application such as MS Word or MS Excel.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">On the other hand, a program written in a programming language such as Python, C++, or Java (to name a few) executes independently of any other application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">A program is executed as stand-alone any time the user wishes without the need of a hosting application.</span></p>
<div class="notice">
<p class="notice"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="notice.jpg"/></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Macros of Microsoft Office are scripts written in VBA. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.2">Their purpose is to automate certain functions within Microsoft Office.</span></p>
<p class="notice"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="notice.jpg"/></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">A lot of people think that JavaScript is a simplified version of Java but in fact the similarity of the names is just a coincidence.</span></p>
<p class="notice"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="remember.jpg"/></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">A script cannot be executed as stand-alone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.2">It requires a hosting application</span><span class="nonitalic"> </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">in order to execute.</span></p>

<h3 id="toc_3"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">2.3 Why You Should Learn Python</span></h3>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Python is what is known as a “high-level” computer language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">Python's coding style is very easy to understand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">It is a flexible and powerful language, making it well-suited for developing medium-scale applications or dynamic web pages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.4">It is the perfect language for teaching programming, especially at the introductory level, and it is widely used in scientific and numerical computing.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">One of Python's capabilities is the ability to interact with the file system of a computer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Python can create files, write in files, or read the contents from files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">It can also create directories, copy files, delete files, rename files, or even change file attributes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.4">Python can perform almost any task related to the file system, making it suitable even for system administration tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.5">For example, you can write a Python program to back up your files or a program that processes text files by reformatting their contents.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">Moreover, Python can execute system commands or any other program installed on your system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.2">Thus, programs written and compiled in C, C++, Java, or any other computer language can be executed from Python and Python can make use of their output. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.3">This enables you to add functionality to your Python programs without spending time rewriting your old ones.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">There are millions—probably even billions—of lines of code already written in Python and your possibilities for code reuse are huge! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">This is why many people prefer using Python to any other programming language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">This is also a very good reason why you should actually learn Python!</span></p>
<h3 id="toc_4"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">2.4 How Python Works</span></h3>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">Computers do not understand natural languages such as English or Greek, so you need a computer language such as Python to communicate with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Python is a very powerful high-level computer language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">The Python interpreter (or, actually, a combination of a compiler and an interpreter) converts Python language to a language that computers can actually understand, and that is known as the “machine language”.</span></p>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">In the past, computer languages made use of either an interpreter or a compiler. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">Nowadays however, many computer languages including Python use both a compiler and an interpreter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">The Python compiler translates Python statements into </span><span class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">bytecode</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1"> statements and saves them in a .pyc file. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">Later, when a user wants to execute the file, the interpreter (often called </span><span class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Python Virtual Machine</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> or </span><span class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">Python VM</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">) converts the bytecode into low-level machine language code for direct execution on the hardware.</span></p>
<div class="notice">
<p class="notice"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="notice.jpg"/></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Python bytecode is a machine language executed by the Python Virtual Machine.</span></p>
<p class="notice"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="notice.jpg"/></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Instead of a compiler and an interpreter, some languages use two compilers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">In C#, for example, the first compiler translates C# statements into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">The CIL code is stored on disk in an executable file called an assembly, typically with an extension of .exe. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.4">Later, when a user wants to execute the file, the .NET Framework performs a Just In Time (JIT) compilation to convert the CIL code into low-level machine language code for direct execution on the hardware.</span></p>

<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Now come some reasonable questions: </span><span class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Why all this trouble? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">Why does Python and other languages (such as C#) translate twice? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">Why are Python statements not directly translated into low-level machine language code?</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> The answer lies in the fact that Python is designed to be a platform-independent programming language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">This means that a program is written once but it can be executed on any device, regardless of its operating system or its architecture, as long as the appropriate version of Python is installed on it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">In the past, programs had to be recompiled, or even rewritten, for each computer platform. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">One of the biggest advantages of Python is that you only have to write and compile a program once! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.5">In </span><span class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Figure 2–2</span></span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> you can see how statements written in Python are compiled into bytecode and how bytecode can then be executed on any platform that has the appropriate version of Python installed on it.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="my_basic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">To write and execute Python programs, you need to install two software applications: a Python interpreter and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">The IDE is necessary for writing Python programs, while the Python interpreter is required for executing them.</span></p>

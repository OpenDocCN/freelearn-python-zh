                    <h1 class="header-title">Preface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Flask is a microframework with a very well designed API, designed to provide the minimum amount of functionality that is needed to create web applications. It does what it's designed to do really well. Unlike other web frameworks, Flask does not have an entire ecosystem bundled with it, no out-of-the-box features to handle databases, cache, security or form handling.</p>
<p>The goal of this concept is to allow programmers to design their applications or tools any way they want, no structure or design is imposed. However, because Flask community is rather large, you can find a wide range of extensions that will help you leverage Flask with a huge set of technologies. One of the main focuses of this book is to introduce these extensions and find out how they can help to avoid reinventing the wheel. The best part about these extensions is that if you don't need their extra functionalities, you don't need to include them and your app will remain small.</p>
<p>This book will help you structure your application to easily scale up to any size. Using packages and a simple and predictable namespace is paramount to keep maintainability and boost team productivity. This is why the other main focus of this book is how to create a <strong>Model View Controller</strong> (<strong>MVC</strong>) architecture with Flask apps.</p>
<p>Modern applications must go beyond well-structured code. Security, dependency isolation, environment configuration, development/production parity and ability to scale on load are factors that must not be neglected. Throughout this book, you will learn how to address these issues, identify possible risks and think ahead of time.</p>
<p>A large amount of research and a lot of first-hand experience of what can go wrong when developing and deploying web applications has been poured into this book. I sincerely hope you will enjoy reading it.</p>

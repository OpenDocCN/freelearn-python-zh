- en: This book is a guide to using the Python scripting language to automate tasks
    in, and build tools for, Maya. The first two chapters provide an overview of Python
    scripting in Maya and the basics of UI creation. From there, chapters three through
    seven each cover a different problem domain, in roughly the same order that they
    are encountered in real-world projects. We start with modeling, moving through
    texturing, rigging, animation, and rendering. The last three chapters cover topics
    needed to flesh out scripts into full tool pipelines, including file input and
    output and communicating with the world outside of Maya via the Web. In the last
    chapter, we'll cover a few more advanced topics, such as script nodes and script
    jobs.

    with Maya*, covers the basics of using Maya''s script editor and getting set up
    to write scripts of your own. It also covers the differences between Maya Embedded
    Language (MEL) and Python. The basic parts of Maya''s built-in commands are covered,
    along with the different modes (create, query, and edit) in which they can be
    invoked.'

- en: What you need for this book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get the most out of this book, you'll need a copy of Maya and a programmer-friendly
    text editor. There are a great number of text editors out there, and many people
    have strong opinions on which they prefer. At a minimum, you'll want an editor
    that saves in plain text and offers the option to display line numbers. You'll
    also likely want an editor that offers syntax highlighting for Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of the code for this book was written using Sublime Text ([https://www.sublimetext.com/](https://www.sublimetext.com/)),
    an excellent and low-cost text editor that is great for Python, as well as many
    other tasks. You don't have to use that though; any text editor that allows you
    to edit plain text will work just fine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Almost all of the examples in the book rely on nothing more than Python and
    Maya, but there is one example that uses PIL. To install PIL, you'll likely want
    to use PIP, a package manager that makes installing Python packages easy. You
    can get that at [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

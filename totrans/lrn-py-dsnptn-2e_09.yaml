    design pattern, in which subclasses redefine the concrete steps of the algorithm,
    thus achieving flexibility and code reuse. You learned about the Template Method
    and how it is used to construct the algorithm with a sequence of steps. We discussed
    the UML diagram, its pros and cons, learned more about it in the FAQ section,
    and summarized the discussion at the end of the chapter.

    software design or solution is not implemented with just one design pattern. Actually,
    patterns are often used together and combined to achieve a given design solution.
    As GoF defines, "*a compound pattern combines two or more patterns into a solution
    that solves a recurring or general problem*." A Compound pattern is not a set
    of patterns working together; it is a general solution to a problem.

    that can be easily modified and maintained. Essentially, the MVC pattern talks
    about separating the application into three essential parts: model, view, and
    controller. These three parts are interconnected and help in separating the ways
    in which information is represented to the way information is presented.'

    logic (how information is stored and queried), view is nothing but the representation
    (how it is presented) of the data, and controller is the glue between the two,
    the one that directs the model and view to behave in a certain way based on what
    a user needs. Interestingly, the view and controller are dependent on the model
    but not the other way round. This is primarily because a user is concerned about
    the data. Models can be worked with independently and this is the key aspect of
    the MVC pattern.'

    the charges are $10, and $15 for 1,000 voice messages. Thus, the model represents

    product and the other is to list the pricing for the services.

    on the backend logic, and so the development efforts can still run independently.

- en: 'A: Compound patterns are essentially groups of patterns put together to solve
    large design problems in software application development. The MVC pattern is
    the most popular and widely used Compound pattern. As it is so widely used and
    reliable, it is treated as a pattern itself.'

- en: 'A: No, a website is the best example to describe MVC. However, MVC can be used
    in multiple areas such as GUI applications or any other place where you need loose
    coupling and splitting of components in an independent way. Typical examples of
    MVC include blogs, movie database applications, and video streaming web apps.
    While MVC is useful in many places, it''s overkill if you use it for the landing
    pages, marketing content, or quick single-page applications.'

    from multiple models and presented in one view. One-to-one mapping is rare in

- en: We began the chapter by understanding Compound patterns and looked at the Model-View-Controller
    pattern and how it is effectively used in software architecture. We then looked
    at how the MVC pattern is used to ensure loose coupling and maintain a multilayer
    framework for independent task development.

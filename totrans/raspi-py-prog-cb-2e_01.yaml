    block programming, such as **Scratch**, to traditional **C**, right down to **BASIC**,
    and even raw **Machine Code Assembler**. A good programmer often has to be code
    multilingual to be able to play to the strengths and weaknesses of each language
    in order to best meet the needs of their desired application. It is useful to
    understand how different languages (and programming techniques) try to overcome
    the challenge of converting "what you want" into "what you get" as this is what
    you are trying to do as well while you program.

- en: Python has been selected as a good place to start when learning about programming,
    by providing a rich set of coding tools while still allowing simple programs to
    be written without fuss. This allows beginners to gradually be introduced to the
    concepts and methods on which modern programming languages are based without requiring
    them to know it all from the start. It is very modular with lots of additional
    libraries that can be imported to quickly extend the functionality. You will find
    that over time, this encourages you to do the same, and you will want to create
    your own modules that you can plug into your own programs, thus taking your first
    steps into structured programming.

  zh: Python被选为学习编程的好起点，因为它提供了一套丰富的编码工具，同时仍然允许编写简单的程序而无需烦恼。这使得初学者可以逐渐接触现代编程语言所基于的概念和方法，而无需一开始就了解所有内容。它非常模块化，有许多额外的库可以导入，以快速扩展功能。你会发现随着时间的推移，这会鼓励你做同样的事情，你将想要创建自己的模块，可以将它们插入到自己的程序中，从而迈出结构化编程的第一步。
- en: Like all programming languages, Python isn't perfect; things such as adding
    a space at the start of a line will often break your code (indents matter a lot
    in Python; they define how blocks of code are grouped together). Generally, Python
    is slow; since it is interpreted, it takes time to create a module while it is
    running the program. This can be a problem if you need to respond to time critical
    events. However, you can precompile Python or use modules written in other languages
    to overcome this. It hides the details; this is both an advantage and disadvantage.
    It is excellent for beginners but can be difficult when you have to second-guess
    aspects such as data-types. However, this in turn forces you to consider all the
    possibilities, which can be a good thing.

    load NOOBS from the `RECOVERY` partition. If at this point *Shift* is pressed,

    built-in LAN connection on the Model B. If you are using a Model A Raspberry Pi,
    a USB-to-LAN adapter can be used (refer to the *There's more…* section of the
    *Networking and connecting your Raspberry Pi to the Internet via a USB Wi-Fi dongle*
    recipe for details on how to configure this).

    of its IP address (the default is `raspberrypi`). To assist with this, you may
    need some additional software such as **Bonjour** to ensure hostnames on the network
    are correctly registered. If you have an OS X Mac, you will have Bonjour running
    already. On Windows, you can either install iTunes (if you haven't got it) which
    also includes the service, or you can install it separately (via the Apple Bonjour
    Installer available from [https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999)).
    Then you can use the hostname, `raspberrypi` or `raspberrypi.local`, to connect
    to the Raspberry Pi over the network. If you need to change the hostname, then
    you can do so in the Raspberry Pi configuration tool, shown previously.

    home folder by setting up file sharing; this makes it much easier to transfer
    files and provides a quick and easy way to back up your data. **Server Message
    Block** (**SMB**) is a protocol that is compatible with Windows file sharing,
    OS X, and Linux.

    To avoid this, I developed the Pi-Kitchen project ([https://github.com/PiHw/Pi-Kitchen](https://github.com/PiHw/Pi-Kitchen)),
    based on the groundwork of Kevin Hill. This aims to provide a flexible platform
    for creating customized setups that can be automatically deployed to an SD card.

    from setting up custom drivers for Wi-Fi devices, to mapping shared drives on
    your network, to providing a fully functional web server out of the box, all combining
    to make your required setup.

    everything configured, it can be incredibly useful to deploy fully working setups
    directly onto an SD card. Ultimately, the project could be combined with Kevin
    Hill's advanced version of NOOBS, called PINN (short for PINN Is Not NOOBS), which
    aims to allow extra features for advanced users, such as allowing operating systems
    and configurations to be stored on your network or on an external USB memory stick.

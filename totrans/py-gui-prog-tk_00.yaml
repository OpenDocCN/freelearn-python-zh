- en: Writing a book involves much more than the application of grammar and punctuation
    rules. In the same way, developing an application requires more than a knowledge
    of programming languages and library APIs. A mere mastery of syntax rules and
    function calls is not in itself sufficient for designing applications that empower
    users to perform work, safeguard valuable data, and produce flawless output. As
    programmers, we also need to be able to interpret user requests and expectations
    into effective interface designs and pick the best technologies to implement them.
    We need to be able to organize large code bases, test them, and maintain them
    in a way that keeps them manageable and free from careless errors.

- en: This book aims to be much more than a reference manual for a particular GUI
    toolkit. As we walk through a fictitious workplace scenario, you will get a taste
    of what it's like to be an application programmer in a small office environment.
    In addition to learning Tkinter and a few other useful libraries, you will learn
    many of the skills you need to move from being a writer of short scripts to a
    writer of fully-featured graphical applications. By the time you've finished the
    book, you should feel confident that you can develop a simple but useful data-oriented
    application for a working environment.

- en: This book is for beginners who have learned the basics of Python but haven't
    written much beyond simple scripts. We'll walk you step-by-step through designing
    and creating a larger application, and we'll introduce you to skills that will
    help you advance as a programmer.

    or system administration, but who now want to branch out into creating GUI applications.
    We'll go through the knowledge and skills required to create local GUI applications.

    just want to learn Tkinter, as much of the book details the finer points of using
    the Tkinter library.

    to write and run simple scripts using built-in types and functions, how to define

- en: You can follow this book on a computer running a current version of Microsoft
    Windows, Apple macOS, or a distribution of GNU/Linux. Ensure that you have Python
    3 and Tcl/Tk installed (*Chapter 1*, *Introduction to Tkinter*, contains instructions
    for Windows, macOS, and Linux) and that you have a code editing environment with
    which you are comfortable (we suggest IDLE since it comes with Python and uses
    Tkinter. We do not recommend the use of Jupyter, Spyder, or similar environments
    aimed at analytical Python rather than application development). In the later
    chapters, you'll need access to the internet so that you can install Python packages
    and the PostgreSQL database.

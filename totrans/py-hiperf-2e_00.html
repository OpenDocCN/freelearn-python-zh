<p>The Python programming language has seen a huge surge in popularity in recent years, thanks to its intuitive, fun syntax, and its vast array of top-quality third-party libraries. Python has been the language of choice for many introductory and advanced university courses as well as for numerically intense fields, such as the sciences and engineering. Its primary applications also lies in machine learning, system scripting, and web applications.</p>
<p>The reference Python interpreter, CPython, is generally regarded as inefficient when compared to lower-level languages, such as C, C++, and Fortran. CPython’s poor performance lies in the fact that the program instructions are processed by an interpreter rather than being compiled to efficient machine code. While using an interpreter has several advantages, such as portability and the additional compilation step, it does introduce an extra layer of indirection between the program and the machine, which causes a less efficient execution.</p>
<p>Over the years, many strategies have been developed to overcome CPython's performance shortcomings. This book aims to fill this gap and will teach how to consistently achieve strong performance out of your Python programs.</p>
<p>This book will appeal to a broad audience as it covers both the optimization of numerical and scientific codes as well as strategies to improve the response times of web services and applications.</p>
<p>The book can be read cover-to-cover ; however, chapters are designed to be self-contained so that you can skip to a section of interest if you are already familiar with the previous topics.</p>

<p><a href="3797e4bb-99b8-4ba2-bb17-f757078b1d2b.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Exploring Compilers</em>, covers tools that can be used to compile Python to efficient machine code. The chapter will teach you how to use Numba, an optimizing compiler for Python functions, and PyPy, an alternative interpreter that can execute and optimize Python programs on the fly.</p>
<p><a href="2b46e5c0-5308-4073-b1c6-4232a881b39f.xhtml">Chapter 6</a><em>, Implementing Concurrency</em>, is a guide to asynchronous and reactive programming. We will learn about key terms and concepts, and demonstrate how to write clean, concurrent code using the asyncio and RxPy frameworks.</p>
<p><a href="e1635214-34c6-4202-aae1-cea316d09422.xhtml">Chapter 7</a><em>, Parallel Processing</em>, is an introduction to parallel programming on multi-core processors and GPUs. In this chapter, you will learn to achieve parallelism using the multiprocessing module and by expressing your code using Theano and Tensorflow.</p>
<p><a href="95fc6212-c0ee-4dee-8d8a-56dc57fb6c97.xhtml">Chapter 8</a><em>, Distributed Processing</em>, extends the content of the preceding chapter by focusing on running parallel algorithms on distributed systems for large-scale problems and big data. This chapter will cover the Dask, PySpark, and mpi4py libraries.</p>
<p><a href="bbc64aae-bd9e-46d0-98a5-d3a718fde570.xhtml">Chapter 9</a><em>, Designing for High Performance</em>, discusses general optimization strategies and best practices to develop, test, and deploy your high-performance Python applications.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "To summarize, we will implement a method called <kbd>ParticleSimulator.evolve_numpy</kbd> and benchmark it against the pure Python version, renamed as <kbd>ParticleSimulator.evolve_python</kbd>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>
    def square(x):<br/>    return x * x<br/><br/>    inputs = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]<br/>    outputs = pool.map(square, inputs)
</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>
    def square(x):<br/>    return x * x<br/><br/>    inputs = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]<br/><strong>    outputs = pool.map(square, inputs)</strong>
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>$ time python -c 'import pi; pi.pi_serial()' </strong><br/><strong>real 0m0.734s</strong><br/><strong>user 0m0.731s</strong><br/><strong>sys 0m0.004s</strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "On the right, clicking on the tab <span class="packt_screen">Callee Map</span> will display a diagram of the function costs."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>

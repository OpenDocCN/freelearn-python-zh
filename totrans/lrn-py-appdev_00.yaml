- en: Python is one of the most widely used dynamic programming languages. It supports
    a rich set of libraries and frameworks that enable rapid development. Such fast-paced
    development often comes with its own baggage that can bring down the overall quality,
    performance, and extensibility of the application. This book will help you push
    your Python skill level by teaching you how to build and deploy interesting applications.

    and developing robust and efficient applications. It touches upon several important
    topics in an accessible and fun way.

    course of this book, you will meet many fictional game characters. While you learn
    different topics, these imaginary characters will talk to you, ask questions,
    and request new features.

    ones focus on software robustness, packaging, and releasing the application code.
    The next few chapters are about improving the application's lifetime by making
    the code extensible, reusable, and readable. You will learn about refactoring,
    unit testing, design patterns, documentation, and best practices.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Developing Simple Applications"), *Developing
    Simple Applications*, starts with installation prerequisites and the theme of
    the book. The first program is a fantasy text-based game presented as a script.
    An incremental version of this program with new features is then developed using
    functions. With more features added, the code becomes difficult to manage. To
    address this, the game application is redesigned using OOP concepts. This application
    now becomes the reference version for the next few chapters.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Dealing with Exceptions"), *Dealing with
    Exceptions*, will teach you how to fix the obvious issues that the code written
    in the previous chapter has. You will learn how to add exception handling code
    to make the application robust. You will also learn about the `try…except…finally`
    clause, raising and re-raising exceptions, creating and using custom exception
    classes, and so on.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Modularize, Package, Deploy!"), *Modularize,
    Package, Deploy!*, will teach you how to modularize and package the code written
    in the earlier chapters. After preparing a package, it will show you how to deploy
    a source distribution, make incremental releases, set up a private Python package
    repository, and bring the code under version control.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Documentation and Best Practices"), *Documentation
    and Best Practices*, dives into coding standards, which are a set of guidelines
    that you should follow while developing the code. Complying with these standards
    can make a significant impact on code readability and the life of the code. In
    this chapter, you will learn about another important aspect of software development,
    code documentation, and best practices. It starts with an introduction to the
    reStructuredText format and uses it to write docstrings. You will create HTML
    documentation for the code using the Sphinx document generator. The chapter also
    talks about some important coding standards for writing a Python code and using
    PyLint to check the code quality.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Unit Testing and Refactoring"), *Unit Testing
    and Refactoring*, starts with an introduction to the unit testing framework in
    Python. You will write some unit tests for the game application developed so far.
    It covers many other topics, such as using Mock library in unit tests and measuring
    effectiveness of the unit tests with code coverage. The later part of the chapter
    talks about many code refactoring techniques. This is the last chapter that makes
    use of the code developed in the earlier chapters. The following chapters will
    have their own simplified examples tied to the same high-fantasy theme.'

    you how, during development, you often encounter a recurring problem. Many times,
    a general solution or recipe exists, which just works for this problem. This is
    often referred to as a design pattern. This chapter introduces you to some commonly
    used design patterns. It covers the strategy, simple and abstract factory, and
    adapter patterns. For each pattern, a simple game scenario will demonstrate a
    practical problem. You will learn how the design pattern can help solve this problem.
    Each of these patterns will be implemented using a Pythonic approach.'

    chapters on performance improvements. You will write a simple program called *Gold
    Hunt* that looks harmless until you tweak some parameters. The parameter tweaking
    reveals performance problems. In this chapter, you will identify the time-consuming
    blocks of the code. It covers the basic ways to clock the application runtime,
    profiling the code to identify performance bottlenecks, the basics of memory profiling,
    and using big-O notation to represent computational complexity.'

    techniques, such as algorithm changes, list comprehension, generator expressions,
    the right choice of data structures, and so on, to improve the application performance.'

    using command-line programs. In this chapter, however, you will learn about the
    `Tkinter` module, MVC architecture, and develop a GUI version of the first application
    developed in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Developing Simple Applications"),

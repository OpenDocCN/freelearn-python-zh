- en: Pygame is a fun Python API with which we can easily create simple games. It
    has support for drawing, sound, images, animation, OpenGL, and more. We will explore
    many aspects of Pygame with more than 20 recipes in this book. The book is self-contained
    and only assumes that you have basic knowledge of Python programming. You are
    encouraged to try out all the example games and modify them to your own needs.

    right in with the popular Scikits-learn open source Python framework. Of course,
    this is a huge topic that could require years to master. We expose the tip of
    the iceberg and give clustering a go.'

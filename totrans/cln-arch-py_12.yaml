    through our task management system. We built domain entities, implemented use
    cases, and created a command line interface (CLI) that demonstrated how Clean
    Architecture’s boundaries enable clear separation between our core business logic
    and user interfaces. While the CLI provides a functional interface, many applications
    require web-based access. This presents an excellent opportunity to show how Clean
    Architecture’s principles enable interface evolution without compromising architectural
    integrity.

    key benefits: the ability to add new interfaces without modifying existing code.
    Because our domain logic, use cases, and controllers were built with proper architectural
    boundaries, adding a web interface becomes a purely additive exercise. No refactoring
    of existing components is required. This same principle that makes adding a web
    UI straightforward also enables long-term maintenance of multiple interfaces,
    as each can evolve independently while sharing the same robust core.'

    of both our business logic (Application Container) and web interface (Web Container)
    through Flask. The Application Container holds our core business logic while the

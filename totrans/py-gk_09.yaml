- en: In this part of the book, our journey will take a turn toward programming for
    scalable applications. A typical Python interpreter runs on a single thread running
    on a single process. For this part of our journey, we discuss how to scale out
    Python beyond this single thread running on a single process. To do that, we first
    look into multithreading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming on a single
    machine. Then, we explore how we can go beyond the single machine and run our
    applications on clusters using Apache Spark. After that, we investigate using
    cloud computing environments to focus on the application and leave the infrastructure
    management to cloud providers.

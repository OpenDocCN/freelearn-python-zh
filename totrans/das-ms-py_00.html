<p>Welcome to <em>Daniel Arbuckle's Mastering Python</em>. Python is a member of the C family of languages, such as C++ and Java; however, Python is more of a distant cousin, as the designers of Python are quite happy to do things in a different way if it seems better. Therefore, if you're familiar with C or one of its descendant languages, you'll find Python relatively familiar.</p>
<p>The goal of this book is to help you move from being a Python newcomer to being able to use an assortment of advanced techniques. Along with C, C++, and Java, Python is one of the languages that everybody needs to know well. Python is, in my humble opinion, the best all-round language available and it's a whole lot of fun too!</p>
<p>We will progress roughly from entry-level to an advanced level, but for the most part, each chapter is independent of the others. Feel free to skip around to the things that you need to learn, or work through the course in order to get up to speed. So, let's get you there.</p>

<p>You will need Ubuntu 16.04 and Python (version 3.6). You can also run the code examples on Windows and macOS. </p>
<p>You may opt to use VirtualBox as well to test the code in the book. </p>

<p class="NormalPACKT">If you are a programmer and are familiar with the basics of Python and you want to broaden your knowledge base to develop projects better and faster, this book is for you. Even if you are not familiar with Python, our book starts with the basics and takes you on a journey to become an expert in the technology. </p>

<p class="mce-root">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Using a <kbd>name</kbd> variable to look up the stored value is an expression; so is running a function."</p>
<p class="mce-root">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>
def example_function(name, radius):<br/>    area = math.pi * radius ** 2<br/>    return "The area of {} is {}" .format(name, area)
</pre>
<p class="NormalPACKT">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>
def example_function(name, radius):<br/>    <strong>area = math.pi * radius ** 2</strong><br/>    <strong>return "The area of {} is {}" .format(name, area)</strong>
</pre>
<p class="mce-root">Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>python3 example_1_2_3.py</strong>
</pre>
<p class="mce-root"><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Click on Environments Variables...."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>

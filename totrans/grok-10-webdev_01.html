Currently, there are lots of fine options available for web development frameworks for Python, and Grok might be one of the least well known. This book presents Grok in detail, through the development of a complete web application. In the process, this book will let us know why Grok is a very good option for building web applications, no matter if they are small and simple, or large and complex. In this chapter, we'll start with:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What makes Grok an attractive option for Python web development</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How Grok makes use of the Zope Toolkit and why this makes Grok powerful and flexible</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Which are Grok's most important concepts and why they are useful</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How Grok compares to other web development frameworks</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec01"/>Why Grok?</h1></div></div></div><p>Grok is a modern web framework, which means:<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It offers an agile development process, with an emphasis on producing working code quickly, but always with an eye on clarity and testability. It doesn't require extensive configuration.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It provides a set of conventions for developing applications, including a file system layout and code structure. Grok's design encourages developers to share standards and provides them with a good practice to follow, when organizing their code. This allows less experienced developers to be productive from the start.</li></ul></div><p>Grok supports strong integration with relational databases, including the use of many object relational mappers, and also offers a transparent way to store Python objects, by using its own object-oriented database. Grok offers a solid foundation for developing powerful, extensible, and secure web applications without too much complexity. This is in part because it uses, at its core, the<strong> Zope Toolkit</strong>, which is a set of libraries intended for reuse by projects in order to develop web applications or frameworks. This collection of libraries uses a common component development model, known as the <strong>Zope Component Architecture</strong> (<strong>ZCA</strong>).</p><p>The ZCA is developed in the Zope community, which has been developing web applications by using Python for more than a decade. Grok builds on that experience and offers a strong combination of experience and agility. When using Grok, you will get:<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A core framework that has been evolving for more than ten years, always learning new lessons and looking for improvements, based on extensive experience on projects deployed in all kinds of production environments.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A flexible, forward-looking architecture that allows developers to create applications that can be evolved and extended over long periods of time, even by other developers and, sometimes, without having to touch the original code at all.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A practical, knowledgeable development community, which has been around for a long time, and is willing to offer advice on how best to learn and take advantage of the framework.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A wide range of integrated features, such as internationalization, form generation and validation, security, cataloguing, and templating.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An impressive number of ready-to-use components that can be used as building blocks for your own applications. As with Zope 3 itself, these are usually thoroughly tested, solid components with good API documentation.</li></ul></div><p>Grok gives web developers a range of useful features for our applications which can easily be integrated as dependencies into our code.</p></div></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec02"/>Distinguishing Grok concepts</h1></div></div></div><p>Grok has many things in common with other modern web development frameworks, but it also offers some very unique features, which make it stand apart from the crowd. We'll briefly mention three of them here:<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The component architecture</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The object database</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The concept of object publishing and traversal</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec01"/>The Zope Component Architecture</h2></div></div></div><p>One distinguishing feature of Grok is its use of a component architecture that is intended to enable developers to create independent components that can be freely reused and exchanged.<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>Components are simply objects that perform a specified functionality. In the ZCA, this functionality is declared formally by using Interfaces, which are classes that describe the various methods and attributes of an object. A component that implements the same interface as some other component can easily be exchanged for it, giving the developer the option of combining components in different ways and substituting any specific component with newer or better implementations.</p><p>The ZCA includes two kinds of components adapters and utilities. An<strong> adapter</strong> is a component that extends another component with additional data, functionality, or presentation capabilities. A<strong> utility</strong> is a standalone component that provides some kind of service, such as database connectivity, encryption, or mail delivery. In Grok, the term<strong> content component</strong> is used to define the code with which these adapters and utilities interact.<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>For example, a common paradigm used to describe modern web frameworks is called<strong> Model/View/Controller</strong>, or<strong> MVC</strong> for short. The<em> model</em> is the content itself, which is usually stored in a relational database, along with the business rules that define how to modify it; the<em> view</em> is the HTML page that the user sees and with which he interacts; the<em> controller</em> is the code that gathers dynamic data from the view and pushes it to the model for processing and assembling a new HTML page with the results.</p><p>In MVC terms, the model is a component that provides data and is called a content component in Grok. The view and the controller are both adapters that act on this component, the former providing presentation capabilities to it, and the latter giving it additional functionality.</p><p>Using the ZCA gives Grok developers several advantages we get a standard way to extend other objects, which can even be used to add functionality to them from outside, without even touching their code. Also, we are able to both create reusable components, and use existing components that were developed elsewhere. In addition to this, we get a global registry that we can use to easily create our own component registries, thus avoiding code duplication.</p><p>This may sound somewhat abstract, so imagine an actual web application where we have several types of objects that represent items in a store catalog. Suppose that this application was developed by a third party, but we need to add a web page that shows specific information for each item, depending on where in the world the user browsing the catalog is located. In Grok, we can easily do that by creating the new view in an independent package and using the ZCA to hook it up with the original object with one single line of code. There is no need to touch the third-party application at all.<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec02"/>Object database</h2></div></div></div><p>Most Python web frameworks use relational databases to store their object data, which, for complex data structures, can mean that the data is spread over different tables and then joined together by using complex queries. As Python is an object-oriented language, it makes a lot more sense to store the objects directly, which Zope 3 accomplishes by using its own object database, known as the ZODB.<a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>The<strong> ZODB</strong> is a transactional object store with load-balancing capabilities, and is one of the defining concepts of Zope since the very beginning. It allows developers to work with their objects and persist them almost transparently (it's enough to inherit from a persistent class). There is no need to worry about putting together the objects at read time and taking them to pieces when writing.</p><p>The ZODB is one of the pieces of Grok that can be used independently in any Python environment.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec03"/>Object publishing and traversal</h2></div></div></div><p>In other web frameworks, URLs are usually mapped into code, which calls the correct template or returns the requested result. In Grok, URLs are mapped to objects, which means that any object can have a corresponding view.<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If you think of the ZODB storage as a tree, you can visualize how Grok resolves URLs as going from the root node of the tree to the branches, and then sub-branches, until it reaches an object instance to display. This process of "walking the tree" is known as<strong> traversal</strong>.</p><p>The traversal mechanism "just works", which means that in practice, you can have nested hierarchies of any length and never have to worry about it as long as you provide default views for all of your object classes (these are called index views in Grok).</p><p>In contrast, many Python web frameworks use the concept of "URL routing", which requires the assignment of known paths to database objects by using some sort of regular expression syntax that involves object attributes on the database, such as ID, and a number of possible actions. Modifying these routes from outside the application is not easy.</p><p>In addition to the default traversal mechanism, Grok also allows the use of custom traversal methods, which can return arbitrary object instances and views. This can be used to traverse results from a relational mapper query, for example.<a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec03"/>Other Grok features</h1></div></div></div><p>There are lots of other goodies that Grok offers for web application development. Here's a look at just a handful.<a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec04"/>Integrated security model</h2></div></div></div><p>Grok has a very granular security model, based on permissions and roles. It allows the developer to assign specific permissions to a given view and then map those permissions to different roles. It uses the ZCA to permit pluggable components to be used for authentication and authorization.<a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec05"/>Easy use of existing Python libraries and modules</h2></div></div></div><p>Of course, Python web frameworks are very powerful because they allow easy access to the multitude of Python libraries and modules available, starting with Python's own standard library. Grok allows developers to take advantage of this body of software, of course, but that's not the best part. Using the ZCA, it is possible to add views and functionality to objects instantiated from any of these modules without modifying their code, thus allowing us to reuse them more easily.<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec06"/>Static resources</h2></div></div></div><p>Grok has a special directory name reserved for all of the static files, such as images, CSS stylesheets, or JavaScript files. You can work with these resources like you would in any other web development environment.<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Relational database access</h2></div></div></div><p>Grok includes the powerful ZODB for transparent object persistence, but, of course, there are times when a relational database is better suited for storing some kinds of data. Grok also features easy access to relational databases by using object relational mappers such as SQLAlchemy, so we can get the best of both worlds.<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Python Web Server Gateway Interface compatibility</h2></div></div></div><p>Grok can be configured as a WSGI application and plugged into a pipeline together with other Python applications. This allows the developer to combine different web frameworks and applications into a single site, enabling him to use the best of breed applications wherever possible.<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec04"/>How Grok compares to other web frameworks</h1></div></div></div><p>Developers who have used, or are familiar with, other web frameworks may like to know a bit about how Grok compares to them. Although a full comparison is out of scope of this book, a few sentences about popular frameworks may be helpful.<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>PHP</h2></div></div></div><p>PHP allows a quick development pace, but does not encourage structured and secure web development practices. Grok offers an agile but a much more structured experience, which encourages good practices from the start. Grok also has a clean separation of concerns. Its templating language, ZPT, focuses on presentation, and avoids too much application logic, unlike PHP, which by its own nature combines everything into one template.<a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Java frameworks</h2></div></div></div><p>Like Java frameworks, Grok is designed with an eye on developing large and complex applications. Developers coming from Java web frameworks will find that Grok's conventions will drastically reduce configuration file usage. Grok uses a dynamic language, and the lack of a compile cycle greatly speeds up the development cycle. The Python language makes it easier to even test out things from the command line.<a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Ruby on Rails</h2></div></div></div><p>Grok is heavily inspired by Ruby on Rails. Rails was one of the earliest frameworks to articulate agile philosophies into two general principles:<em> Don't Repeat Yourself</em> (DRY) and<em> Convention over configuration</em>. DRY means to avoid repeating the same code or information in different places something that Rails strongly enforces in its development practices. Convention over configuration means that instead of depending on explicit configuration to work, many framework aspects and code constructs have sensible default values. Grok takes these concepts to heart and combines them with the Zope Toolkit and the Zope Component Architecture, to offer a powerful and unique development platform.<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Django</h2></div></div></div><p>Django is one of the most popular Python web development frameworks. One of its key selling points is the automatic generation of administrative interfaces for its applications, which Grok doesn't do. Django is similar to Grok in the use of the<em> Convention over configuration</em> and<em> Don't Repeat Yourself</em> principles. It also offers the full power of the Python programming language and wants to be a full stack solution for web development problems. Unlike Grok, its architecture is focused on building relational database backed applications and integrating third-party pieces into its stack, while still keeping features such as the administration interfaces working, which is not easy.<a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>Pylons</h2></div></div></div><p>Pylons is more of a minimal web framework, whereas Grok is trying to offer a full stack of components. Developers using Pylons may find a more powerful framework in Grok, at the expense of some of the flexibility that a minimal framework enables.<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/>
</p></div></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec05"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we have introduced Grok and shown why it is a great option for modern web application development. In the next chapter, we'll see how to put Grok into action, and will get our first, simple application up and running.</p></div></div>

  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you'll learn about the major tools, techniques, and skills of automated testing in the Python 3 language. You'll learn about the tools that are included in Python's standard library, such as doctest, unittest, and unittest.mock. You'll also learn about useful nonstandard tools such as Nose and coverage.py. As we're talking about these tools, we'll also be discussing the philosophy and best practices of testing, so when you're done you'll be ready to use what you've learned in real-world projects.</p><p>This book is a successor to an earlier book, <span class="emphasis"><em>Python Testing: Beginner's Guide</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Daniel Arbuckle</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Packt Publishing</em></span> which only covered Python up to version 2.6. Python 3 and its related tools are just slightly too different to justify calling this book a second edition. If you've read the earlier book and parts of this book seem familiar to you, it's because the two books are in fact similar.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is primarily for people who have a solid grasp of the Python language, and want a boost in working with automated testing. If you do not know Python at all, this book will still serve as an introduction to automated testing philosophy and practices. Thanks to Python's executable pseudocode nature, though, you might find the road a little bumpy at times.</p></div></div>

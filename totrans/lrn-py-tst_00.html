  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you'll learn about the major tools, techniques, and skills of automated testing in the Python 3 language. You'll learn about the tools that are included in Python's standard library, such as doctest, unittest, and unittest.mock. You'll also learn about useful nonstandard tools such as Nose and coverage.py. As we're talking about these tools, we'll also be discussing the philosophy and best practices of testing, so when you're done you'll be ready to use what you've learned in real-world projects.</p><p>This book is a successor to an earlier book, <em>Python Testing: Beginner's Guide</em>, <em>Daniel Arbuckle</em>, <em>Packt Publishing</em> which only covered Python up to version 2.6. Python 3 and its related tools are just slightly too different to justify calling this book a second edition. If you've read the earlier book and parts of this book seem familiar to you, it's because the two books are in fact similar.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You're going to need Python version 3.4 or later, a text editor, and Internet access to get the most out of this book.</p></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is primarily for people who have a solid grasp of the Python language, and want a boost in working with automated testing. If you do not know Python at all, this book will still serve as an introduction to automated testing philosophy and practices. Thanks to Python's executable pseudocode nature, though, you might find the road a little bumpy at times.</p></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Mock objects are provided by the <code class="literal">unittest.mock</code> module in the standard library."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">class ClassOne:
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        self.arg1 = int(arg1)
        self.arg2 = arg2

    def method1(self, x):
        return x * self.arg1</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">class ClassOne:
    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
        <strong>self.arg1 = int(arg1)</strong>
        self.arg2 = arg2

    def method1(self, x):
        return x * self.arg1</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>$ python -m nose</strong></pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div></div>

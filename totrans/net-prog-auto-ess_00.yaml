    how hard it is for developers to understand computer network concepts and how
    hard it is for network engineers to understand software concepts.

- en: As applications become cloud-based and content is stored in the cloud, network
    infrastructure is the most important asset for today’s businesses. A 10 GE interface
    down for 15 minutes is equivalent to 1 TB of missing data. Minimizing downtime,
    maximizing capacity and speed, and lowering latency and jitter are the major performance
    indicators for network providers today. And it’s becoming impossible to improve
    these indicators without network automation, from the concept and design of the
    network to daily network operations.

- en: This book will start with a brief description of network basics, then will start
    to explore network programming concepts and the automation ecosystem in a bit
    more depth. It will then describe protocols, tools, and techniques for network
    programming. All of these will be based on the two most popular computer languages
    for network automation, which are Go and Python.

    a real-time network emulation. By the end of the book, you will have enough knowledge
    to start programming and creating network automation solutions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B18165_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015), *Network Basics for Development*,
    is focused on explaining the basics of computer networking and the jargon used.
    The idea is to build a good foundation to be built on throughout the book. If
    you are a network engineer or have experience in this field, you might want to
    skip it. If you are a software developer with little network experience, this
    chapter is for you. It will help you build a solid base of network jargon that
    will be useful when writing code for network automation.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B18165_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor041), *Programmable Networks*, looks
    into several different technologies used today to create networks via software.
    Then we will examine the current standard technology, known as **Software Defined
    Networks** (**SDNs**).'

- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B18165_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor067), *Accessing the Network*, explores
    the most common methods and protocols for accessing network devices for our network
    automation. Since devices have multiple methods, we will aim to give you enough
    information so that you can choose the one that is most appropriate for your network
    automation code.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B18165_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor100), *Working with Network Configurations
    and Definitions*, explores how to work with a network configuration and how to
    define it for effective use with network automation. We want to build scalable
    and future-proof solutions. The chapter answers why we need network definitions
    to help automation.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B18165_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor127), *Dos and Don’ts for Network
    Programming*, focuses on the most important best coding practices for Python and
    Go related to network programming. Writing code for networks is exciting because
    when it fails, it is challenging, and when it works, it is rewarding. If you are
    an experienced programmer, it will be plain sailing, but if you are a newbie,
    it will be stormy. The chapter dives into some coding practices for Go and Python
    that will help you get through these storms more easily.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B18165_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor166), *Using Go and Python for Network
    Programming*, looks at how Python and Go are powerful and useful for network programming,
    but depending on what the requirements are and the environment, one might be better
    suited than the other. We’ll also check the advantages and disadvantages of using
    Python and Go.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B18165_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor183), *Error Handling and Logging*,
    explores how we report program execution events and how we handle errors. These
    two topics are not as easy as they seem, and they are, most of the time, implemented
    in systems poorly. The chapter investigates how and why we handle errors and then
    why and how we do event logging.'

    some techniques used today to scale your code up and down effectively, which will
    allow your solution to adapt easily to follow network growth, and, if necessary,
    easily scale down to save resources.'

    testing your network automation code. It also looks into advanced techniques that
    can be used to make your testing framework even more useful and reliable.'

    explored building a network from scratch using the network automation skills we’ve
    learned and emulated routers. The finished emulated network will have enough components
    to experiment with several techniques described in the chapters of this book.
    And finally, there are a few remarks and some guidance for future studies and
    work.'

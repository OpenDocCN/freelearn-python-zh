- en: Python is a flexible language that can be used for much more than just script
    development. By knowing how the Python RESTful APIs work, you can build a powerful
    backend for web applications and mobile applications using Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll take your first steps by building a simple API and learning how the frontend
    web interface can communicate with the backend. You'll also learn how to serialize
    and deserialize objects using the marshmallow library. Then, you'll learn how
    to authenticate and authorize users using Flask-JWT. Apart from all this, you'll
    also learn how to enhance your APIs by adding useful features, such as email,
    image upload, searching, and pagination. You'll wrap up the whole book by deploying
    the APIs to the cloud.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this book, you'll have the confidence and skill to leverage the
    power of RESTful APIs and Python to build efficient web applications.

    in worldwide programming contests at university. Since graduation, he has been
    working in the finance and IT industries for more than 10 years, building systems
    that analyze millions of transactions and positions to spot suspicious activity.
    He has leveraged the powerful analytical Python libraries to perform data analysis
    and performance optimization for a trading system that works at a microsecond
    level. He has an in-depth knowledge of the modern software development life cycle,
    which uses automated testing, continuous integration, and agile methodologies.
    Among all programming languages, he found Python to be the most expressive and
    powerful. He has created courses and taught students all over the world, using
    Python as the teaching language. Inspiring aspiring developers to take on the
    software engineering career path has always been Jack''s goal.'

    that I don't ever take vacation because I just travel to speak at Python conferences.
    This has given me the opportunity to speak with and learn from local Python communities
    around the world.

    a company building a service for rebootless kernel updates on Linux, that was
    acquired by Oracle. These diverse experiences got me onto the Forbes 30 Under
    30 class of 2017 for enterprise software, just in time to age out of the category.

    me in front of an Apple IIci, with a bottle in one hand and a mouse in the other.
    But I didn''t have any intentions around learning how to program until I was in
    college.'

    many of my friends were in the computer science department. I would sort of watch
    them out of the corner of my eye and think to myself that they seemed to be learning
    a toolkit full of tools for solving a broad range of problems in the world. I
    wanted those skills too.

- en: I took a couple of CS classes in my sophomore year, was immediately hooked and
    secretly got a summer internship at a software company without telling my chemistry
    advisor (I don't recommend this tactic). I managed to cram a CS degree into my
    remaining couple of semesters.

    system and learn how to break down and solve problems within it in a structured
    way. You gain confidence as a debugger and as a problem solver.

    You are instilled with the mindset that if you see something that could be better,
    in a language, library or ecosystem, then you can work together with other contributors
    to make that change for everyone's benefit.

    it down into steps, and work with others to implement a solution is a powerful
    mindset. It's an activist's mindset. Programming has profoundly impacted how I
    think about myself and my responsibility to my community. It has motivated my
    time on initiatives ranging from teaching programming to criminal justice reform.

    toolkit that programmers have, but the most enduring effect is that it made me
    an activist. I have since devoted a lot of my energy to creating opportunities
    for others to learn how to program because we need as many people as possible,
    on this planet, to have the activist's mindset that programming encourages.

    started. One should always use the right tool for any task, but Python has such
    broad utility and such a mature ecosystem, that it has fortunately frequently
    been the right tool.

    us to interface with the Linux kernel community. The experience and knowledge
    that we had in open source also shaped how we did software development in what
    came to be a highly distributed team.

    at an internship and I was using some documentation that I thought could be clearer.
    I said, "Hey, this is my chance to contribute to an open source project. I'm going
    to go for it."
  prefs: []

    I was anxious that I might make a mistake and someone would yell at me. I remember
    idling nervously in the IRC channel, opening a new issue in the issue tracker,
    attaching a `diff` and generating and regenerating the docs to convince myself
    that everything looked perfect. I hovered my hand over the submit button for a
    solid minute before working up the nerve to click.

    still a friend and coworker), patiently walked me through the review process.
    He landed my change and encouraged me to keep participating. I had an incredibly
    positive first experience of contributing to an open source project.

    of establishing a culture that welcomes new contributors. This is both because
    it is the right thing to do and because attracting and retaining a diverse contributor
    base is critical for sustaining a large open source project, on which many people
    and companies depend.

    Unlike existing bookkeeping services, we are using software to automate the heavy

    to build this company on Python 3!'

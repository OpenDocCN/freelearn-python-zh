		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Explore the world of design principles and design patterns in the context of the Python programming language with this comprehensive guide. Learn about classic and modern design patterns and how to use them to solve problems you encounter daily as a Python developer or software architect.</p>
			<p>With code examples, real-world case studies, and detailed solution implementations, this book is a must-read for Python developers looking to elevate their coding skills. Co-authored by a Python expert with over two decades of experience, this new edition expands the scope to cover more design pattern categories. Gain insights into creational, structural, behavioral, architectural, and other important patterns for modern software design, such as concurrency, asynchronous, and performance patterns. Learn how to apply these patterns in various domains like event handling systems, concurrency, distributed systems, and testing. The book also presents Python anti-patterns, helping you avoid common pitfalls.</p>
			<p>Whether you’re developing user interfaces, web applications, APIs, data pipelines, or AI models, this book equips you with the knowledge to build robust and maintainable software.</p>
			<p>This book adopts a hands-on approach, providing code examples for each design pattern. Each chapter includes step-by-step instructions to test the code, making it an interactive learning experience. Where applicable, for each design principle or pattern, the book presents at least one real-world example, which may or may not be Python-based, and at least one Python-based example.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for Python developers looking to deepen their understanding of design patterns and how they can be applied to various types of projects. With a focus on intermediate and advanced Python programmers, the book also includes introductory chapters that make it accessible for those who are relatively new to the language. Whether you’re a web developer, data engineer, or AI specialist, this book offers valuable insights into the best practices for software design, backed by real-world examples and decades of experience. It’s also an excellent resource for software architects and team leaders who want to improve code quality and maintainability across their projects.</p>

			<p><a href="B21896_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Patterns for Testing</em>, presents patterns that help in isolating components, making tests more reliable, and promoting code reusability.</p>
			<p><a href="B21896_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor273"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Python Anti-Patterns</em>, explores common programming practices that, while not necessarily wrong, often lead to less efficient, less readable, and/or less maintainable code. You will learn to understand and avoid these pitfalls.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Use a machine with a recent version of Windows, Linux, or macOS.</p>
			<p>Install Python 3.12. It is also useful to create a virtual environment from your Python installation so that when you add third-party modules required for following some of the chapters, you do not end up polluting your global Python. This is a fundamental best practice for productivity with Python, and you will find many resources on the Internet that explain how to do this.</p>
			<p>Install and use Docker on your machine. This will help with the requirement of some external software services or tools, such as LocalStack (used in <a href="B21896_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor163"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>) and the Redis server (used in <a href="B21896_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor216"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>).</p>

			<p>If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</p>

			<p>You can download the example code files for this book from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Python-Design-Patterns-Third-Edition">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Python-Design-Patterns-Third-Edition</a>. If there’s an update to the code, it will be updated in the GitHub repository.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used and formatting specificities throughout this book.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Most of the code has been automatically formatted</h2>
			<p>The formatting has been done using the Black tool, as is commonly done by Python developers for productivity reasons. So it might not look exactly like the code you would write yourself. But it is valid; it is a PEP 8-compliant code. The goal is to improve the readability of the code snippets.</p>
			<p>So, some code snippets in the code files as well as in the book’s pages may look like the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
State = Enum(
    "State",
    "NEW RUNNING SLEEPING RESTART ZOMBIE",
)</pre>			<p>Another example might be the following:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
msg = (
    f"trying to create process '{name}' "
    f"for user '{user}'"
)
print(msg)</pre>			<h2 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>The code snippets in the book’s pages may be shortened</h2>
			<p>To improve readability, when there is a documentation string (docstring) for a function or class, and it is too long, we remove it from the code snippet in the book.</p>
			<p>When some code (class or function) is too long to display on the chapter’s pages, we may shorten it, and refer the reader to the complete code in the file.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In case of an issue with long commands, which are spread across several lines (with the ‘<code>/</code>’ character as separator), you can reformat the long command text, removing the ‘<code>/</code>’ character, to make sure that the command is correctly interpreted in the terminal.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Other conventions</h2>
			<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “Define the <code>Logger</code> interface with a <code>log</code> method.”</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
class MyInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def do_something(self, param: str):
        pass</pre>			<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
			<pre class="console">
python3.12 –m pip install -–user mypy</pre>			<p>Bold: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in bold. Here is an example: “It is one of the core concepts in <strong class="bold">object-oriented programming OOP </strong>that enables a single interface to represent different types.”</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">39.1 Introduction</h3>
<p class="my_basic">All programs you have seen so far can be described as “temporary”. Even though they read some input data and display some output results, all of the values are stored in variables, lists, and other data structures that exist in the main memory (RAM) of your computer; therefore, these values are all lost when the program finishes executing. Even if this doesn't happen, they are certainly lost when you shut down your computer. There are many cases, however, where you need to keep those values in more permanent storage devices, such as a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or a Solid State Drive (SSD).</p>
<p class="my_basic">Python can read input data stored in a computer file or write output results in the same or a different file. This reading/writing process is called File I/O (File Input/Output) and can be implemented with some of Python's ready-to-use functions and methods.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Usually, the type of file being used is a text file. A text file contains a sequence of characters and is stored in a permanent storage device (HDD, SSD etc.).</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Another type of file being used in computer programming is a “binary file”; however, this type is beyond the scope of this book and will be no further analyzed.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In the following sections, you will learn how to open and close a text file, how to read values from or write values in a text file, and even how to search a value within it.</p>
<h3 id="toc_2">39.2 Opening a File</h3>
<p class="my_basic">To use a file (for reading, writing, or appending), the first thing you need to do is open the file. The general form of the Python statement is</p>
<div><p>descriptor = open(filename [, mode])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►descriptor is the name of a file object and can be used to read from, write in, or append to a file.</p>
<p>►filename is a string that contains the folder (directory) and the name of the file stored in the hard disk (or any other storage device, such as SSD, Flash USB disk etc.).</p>
<p>►mode is a string that defines the way that you want to access the file filename. This argument is optional. If omitted, its default value is “r”. The three basic values for this argument are shown in the table that follows.</p>
<div><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="my_table">
<tr>
<th class="center">mode</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="center">r</td>
<td>It opens a text file for reading. The file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file (position 0). If the file filename does not exist, Python throws a runtime error.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="center">w</td>
<td>It opens a text file for writing. If the file filename already exists, Python overwrites it; otherwise, Python creates a new file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="center">a</td>
<td>It opens a text file for appending, preserving any previous content in the file. The file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. If the file filename does not exist, Python creates a new file.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>To some extent, the file pointer can be likened to the index of a list. You will learn more about the file pointer in <a href="#toc_5">Section 39.5</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Let's see some examples.</p>
<p class="strong">Example 1</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following statement</p>
<div><p>f = open("names.txt", "r")        #Equivalent to: f = open("names.txt")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">opens the text file “names.txt” for reading. The file “names.txt” must exist in the same folder (directory) where the source code has been saved. If the file does not exist, Python throws a runtime error.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The function open() is a built-in function of Python. You do not have to import it from any library.</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Example 2</p>
<p class="my_basic">The statement</p>
<div><p>fgrades = open("c:/temp/grades.txt", "w")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">creates the text file “grades.txt” in the folder (directory) “c:/temp” and opens it for writing. If the file already exists, Python overwrites it.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that the path definition of a file uses the slash ( / ) and not the backslash ( \ ) character.</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Example 3</p>
<p class="my_basic">The statement</p>
<div><p>fgrades = open("c:/temp/students/grades.txt", "a")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">opens the text file “grades.txt” for appending. The file must exist in the subfolder (subdirectory) “students” of the folder (directory) “c:/temp”. If the file does not exist, Python creates a new file.</p>
<h3 id="toc_3">39.3 Closing a File</h3>
<p class="my_basic">After completing reading, writing, or appending operations on a file, it is crucial to close the file using the close() method. This method states that the use of the file has been completed, leading the operating system (OS) to save any unsaved data that may exist in the main memory (RAM). The general form of the close() method is as follows:</p>
<div><p>descriptor.close()</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where descriptor is the name of the file object that was used to open the file.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's see some examples.</p>
<p class="strong">Example 1</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following code fragment opens the text file “c:/temp/data.txt” for reading and, at the end, it closes it.</p>
<div><p>fst = open("c:/temp/data.txt")</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements</p></div>
<p>fst.close()</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that when the mode parameter is omitted, the default value is "r".</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Example 2</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following code fragment opens the text file “temperatures.txt” for appending and, at the end, it closes it.</p>
<div><p>f = open("temperatures.txt", "a")</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements</p></div>
<p>f.close()</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_4">39.4 Writing in (or Appending to) a File</h3>
<p class="my_basic">To write a string in (or even append a string to) a file, you can use the write() method. The general form of this method is as follows:</p>
<div><p>descriptor.write(str)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►descriptor is the name of the file object that was used to open the file.</p>
<p>►str is the string value that you want to write in (or append to) the file.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following example creates the file “f_data39.4-i.txt” in the folder (directory) “c:/temp”. If the file “f_data39.4-i.txt” already exists, Python overwrites it; otherwise, Python creates a new file.  Then, the program writes three strings in the file, using the write() method.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.4a</div>
<div><p>PATH = "c:/temp/"</p>
<div></div>
<p>fout = open(PATH + "f_data39.4-i.txt", "w")</p>
<div></div>
<p>fout.write("Good Morning")</p>
<p>fout.write("Good Evening")</p>
<p>fout.write("Good Night")</p>
<div></div>
<p>fout.close()</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Try to execute the above program and then locate and open (using a notepad application) the recently created “c:/temp/f_data39.4-i.txt” file. What you see in the file is the following:</p>
<div><p>Good MorningGood EveningGood Night</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">All three strings were written in a single row. This happened because, unlike the print statement that you're familiar with, the write() method does not automatically add a “line break” at the end of the string.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>To open a text file and see what is written inside, you can use a simple notepad application, such as the Notepad of Windows. Alternatively, you can download free of charge and use the Notepad++ application, from the following address:</p>
<p class="notice center"><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">https://notepad-plus-plus.org</a></p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">To force Python to write a “line break”, you can use the special sequence of characters \n (presented in <a href="chapter06.html#toc_2">Section 6.2</a>). The next example opens the previously created file “c:/temp/f_data39.4-i.txt” for appending. Subsequently, a “line break” is written along with three lines of text.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.4b</div>
<div><p>PATH = "c:/temp/"</p>
<div></div>
<p>fout = open(PATH + "f_data39.4-i.txt", "a")</p>
<div></div>
<p>fout.write("\n")</p>
<p>fout.write("Hello!\n")</p>
<p>fout.write("Hi!\n")</p>
<p>fout.write("Bye!\n")</p>
<div></div>
<p>fout.close()</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">If you execute this program, and then locate and open the “c:/temp/f_data39-i.txt” file with a notepad application, you will now see the following content:</p>
<div><p>Good MorningGood EveningGood Night</p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The first line “Good MorningGood EveningGood Night” was already in the file before opening the file for appending.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The next example creates the file “f_data39.4-ii.txt” in the folder “c:/temp”. If the file “f_data39.4-ii.txt” already exists, Python overwrites it, otherwise, Python creates a new file. Then, the program writes 10 strings on 10 separate lines in the file using the write() method.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.4c</div>
<div><p>PATH = "c:/temp/"</p>
<div></div>
<p>fout = open(PATH + "f_data39.4-ii.txt", "w")</p>
<div></div>
<p>for i in range(1, 11):</p>
<p>fout.write("Line " + str(i) + "\n")</p>
<div></div>
<p>fout.close()</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The argument of the write() method must be of type string. If you wish to write a number (integer or float) in the file, you must first convert it to a string, using the str() function.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_5">39.5 The File Pointer</h3>
<p class="my_basic">As already mentioned, the file pointer is quite similar to the index of a list. Both are used to specify the point from which to read information or where to write new information. However, the main distinction between the file pointer and the list index is that the former is automatically moved every time a read or write operation is performed.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's assume a file already contains the messages “HELLO JOHN\nHI ALL!”. If you open this specific file for reading, the file pointer is automatically placed at the beginning of the file, as shown below.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width33" src="img/chapter39-01.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">If you now perform a read operation (as described in the next section), the reading will commence from the position indicated by the file pointer, and the pointer will automatically advance towards the end, moving as many positions as the characters you have read. Below is the position the file pointer will be in if you read 6 characters from the file.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width33" src="img/chapter39-02.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The subsequent read operation will start from the position where the word “JOHN” begins.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">On the contrary, if you open a file for appending, the file pointer is automatically positioned at the end of the file, as illustrated here:</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width33" src="img/chapter39-03.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">If you then perform a write operation, the writing will commence from the position indicated by the file pointer, and the pointer will automatically advance towards the end, moving as many positions as the characters you have written in the file.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width33" src="img/chapter39-04.png"/></p>
<h3 id="toc_6">39.6 Reading from a File</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Suppose the file “f_data39.6.txt” contains the following text.</p>
<div><p>15.3 15 Round the number down</p>
<p>22.6 23 Round the number up</p>
<p>55.5 56 Round the number up again</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Reading until the end of the current line</p>
<p class="my_basic">To read all the characters from the current position of a file until the end of the current line and assign them to variable var_name_str, you can use the following statement given in general form</p>
<div><p>var_name_str = descriptor.readline()</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►descriptor is the name of the file object that was used to open the file.</p>
<p>►var_name_str can be any variable of type string.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The program that follows assigns the three lines of the file “f_data39.6.txt” to the variables s1, s2, and s3.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.6a</div>
<div><p>PATH = "c:/temp/"</p>
<div></div>
<p>fin = open(PATH + "f_data39.6.txt", "r")</p>
<div></div>
<p>s1 = fin.readline()</p>
<p>s2 = fin.readline()</p>
<p>s3 = fin.readline()</p>
<div></div>
<p>fin.close()</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(s1, end = "")  #It displays: 15.3 15 Round the number down</p>
<p>print(s2, end = "")  #It displays: 22.6 23 Round the number up</p>
<p>print(s3, end = "")  #It displays: 55.5 56 Round the number up again</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>As you already know, the argument end = "" cancels the “line break” at the end of the print statement. However, if you execute the previous example, you will notice that the three lines of the file are displayed one under the other. This happens because the line breaks (special sequence of characters \n) already exist in the file (at the end of each line), and they are assigned to the variables s1, s2, and s3. If you want to get rid of these line breaks, you can use the strip() method (presented in <a href="chapter14.html#toc_3">Section 14.3</a>).</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Reading some characters or until the end of the file</p>
<p class="my_basic">To read length number of characters from the current position and assign them to variable var_name_str, you can use the following statement given in general form. Please note that the argument length is optional. If omitted, all the characters from the current position until the end of the file are read.</p>
<div><p>var_name_str = descriptor.read([length])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►descriptor is the name of the file object that was used to open the file.</p>
<p>►var_name_str can be any variable of type string.</p>
<p>►length can be any value greater than 0 of type integer.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following program assigns the first two values from the file “f_data39.6.txt” to the variables d1, i1 and the text of the first line to the variable s1, while removing the line break. Then, it perform the same operation for the second line of the file, assigning the values to the variables d2, i2 and s2 respectively.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.6b</div>
<div><p>PATH = "c:/temp/"</p>
<div></div>
<p>fin = open(PATH + "f_data39.6.txt", "r")</p>
<div></div>
<p>d1 = fin.read(4)              #Read '15.3' as string</p>
<p>i1 = fin.read(3)              #Read ' 15' as string (including the leading space)</p>
<p>s1 = fin.readline().strip()   #Read the text of the first line and remove \n</p>
<p>d2 = float(fin.read(4))       #Read 22.6 as float</p>
<p>i2 = int(fin.read(3))         #Read 23 as integer</p>
<p>s2 = fin.readline().strip()   #Read the text of the second line and remove \n</p>
<div></div>
<p>fin.close()</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(d1)  #It displays: 15.3</p>
<p>print(i1)  #It displays:  15</p>
<p>print(s1)  #It displays: Round the number down</p>
<p>print(d2)  #d2 is a float. It displays: 22.6</p>
<p>print(i2)  #i2 is an integer. It displays: 23</p>
<p>print(s2)  #It displays: Round the number up</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>The readline() method reads all the characters from the current position of a file until the end of the current line.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In the next example, the read() method assigns all the content of the file “f_data39.6.txt” to the variable s.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.6c</div>

</div>
<h3 id="toc_7">39.7 Iterating Through the Contents of a File</h3>
<p class="my_basic">There are three approaches to iterate through the contents of a file.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's suppose the file “f_to_be_or_not_to_be.txt” contains the following text:</p>
<div><p>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</p>
<p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</p>
<p>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's see all three approaches.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach assigns all the contents of a file to a variable and then, using a for structure, iterates through the characters of the variable, as shown in the example that follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.7a</div>
<div><p>PATH = "c:/temp/"</p>
<div></div>
<p>fin = open(PATH + "f_to_be_or_not_to_be.txt", "r")</p>
<p>s = fin.read()  #Assign the contents of the file to the variable s</p>
<p>fin.close()     #Close the file. No need to keep it open any more!</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Iterate through the contents of the variable s</p>
<p>for i in range(len(s)):</p>
<p>print(s[i])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The next example does pretty much the same, but without the variable s.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.7b</div>
<div><p>PATH = "c:/temp/"</p>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<p>for letter in fin.read():</p>
<p>print(letter)</p>
<div></div>
<p>fin.close()</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>This approach is not suitable when dealing with large files.</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">A better approach to iterate through the contents of a file is to directly access each line of the file using a for structure. The following example displays all the lines of the file, one at each iteration.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.7c</div>
<div><p>PATH = "c:/temp/"</p>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<p>for line in fin:</p>
<p>print(line, end = "")</p>
<div></div>
<p>fin.close()</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Third approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">Another approach to iterate through the contents of a file is to directly access each line of the file using a while-loop. The following example displays all the lines of the file, one at each iteration.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_39.7d</div>

<p>while line != "":</p>
<p>print(line, end = "")</p>
<p>line = fin.readline()</p>
<div></div>
<p>fin.close()</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The methods read() and readline() return an empty string when the current position is at the end of the file.</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">39.9 Review Exercises</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Complete the following exercises.</p>
<p>1)Write a Python program that creates a text file and writes the days of the week (Sunday, Monday etc.), one on each line.</p>
<p>2)Write a Python program that reads the days of the week from the file created in the previous exercise (Sunday, Monday etc.) and stores them into a list. Then, the program must display the days of the week in the exact reverse of the order in which they are stored in the list.</p>
<p>3)Write a Python program that appends to the file of the previous exercise the text “*** End of File ***”, without the double quotes.</p>
<p>4)Write a Python program that writes 50 random integers (between 1 and 100) in a file named “randoms.txt”, one on each line.</p>
<p>5)Write a Python program that creates 10 files named “file1.txt”, “file2.txt”, … “file10.txt” and writes a random 3-digit integer in each one.</p>
<p>6)Write a Python program that writes the following multiplication table in a file.</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">1 x 1 = 1</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">1 x 2 = 2</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">1 x 3 = 3</p>

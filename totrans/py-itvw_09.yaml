    team at LinkedIn. Barry worked for Canonical for 10 years, becoming an Ubuntu
    and Debian developer with responsibility for the Python ecosystem on those operating
    systems. He was the project leader of GNU Mailman, a popular open source mailing
    list manager written in Python. Barry's former roles include lead maintainer for
    Jython, Python release manager and member of PythonLabs. Today he is a core developer,
    the author of several successful Python Enhancement Proposals, and the maintainer
    of numerous Python libraries.

    syntactically like docstrings in Emacs Lisp.

    you had to pass them all in. So that was the motivation for doing keyword arguments.

    a global namespace.

    going to work because those names were colliding with their own symbols. So we
    did the grand renaming, where we went through the entire internal C API and cleaned
    it up, so that you could embed Python in other C applications. So I remember that
    was one of the very first things that I did.

    of email messages.

    message, especially on MIME messages.'

    We had a parser so that you could feed it a bunch of Python 2 byte strings. You
    had this parser and it would give you a tree that represented the email message.
    Then you could manipulate that and pass that tree to a generator. The generator
    would flatten the tree back into the byte representation of an email message,
    along with the MIME boundaries and things like that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    but they're very complicated standards. I think even now we're learning the deficiencies
    and the bugs in it. In any case, mimelib was a thing and I released mimelib as
    a separate third-party package. Then I started using mimelib in Mailman. It was
    a real benefit to have this third-party package that we could develop separately
    from Mailman and just pull in as a dependency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't remember exactly when it happened, but there was a Python release when
    we felt that mimelib was pretty stable and the API was pretty good. So we pulled
    mimelib into the standard library and renamed it as the email package, which is
    a better name for it anyway, because there's a lot more to it than just MIME.

    ecosystem on Ubuntu. That included working on transitions, like trying to move
    everybody to Python 3\. Then as new versions of Python would come out, while I
    didn't directly do the interpreter, I did work on all the packages that were involved.

- en: There are a lot of steps that you have to go through in order to make Python
    3.5 the default version on Ubuntu. It's a long process. A lot of packages won't
    build, or they have bugs in the new version of Python, so you have to fix those,
    prioritize and stuff like that. So one of the main things that I did on Ubuntu
    was really work on the Python ecosystem.
  prefs: []

- en: Again, I was looking at the tools and seeing what pain points Ubuntu developers
    were having with the Python tools. I was trying to figure out how to improve them
    and where to improve them. For example, if there was some friction with using
    pip and setuptools on Ubuntu, then the fixes might have to go into pip and setuptools.
    It was my responsibility to be aware of where people were having pains using Ubuntu.

    Ubuntu had questions about how Python worked, or had problems, I was one of the
    people they could talk to and work with. A lot of it is community-driven, but
    I think if you really want to make a distribution a success, then you have to
    put resources into it. Every Linux distribution puts resources into its communities,
    because otherwise it's just going to fall apart.

    as you build bigger systems. I think this is also a contributing factor to why

    research being conducted.

    CPython, which is the implementation of Python in C, has challenges. Any language

    invented to solve problems in the 90s and the computing world is different now

    Python has as a language, and I think this is its real strength, is that it scales
    along with the human scale. For example, you can have one person write up some
    scripts on their laptop to solve a particular problem that they have. Python's
    great for that.

    come in and learn it easily and be productive very quickly. They can pull down
    a completely new Python source code for a project that they've never seen before
    and dive in and learn it very easily and quickly. There are some challenges as
    Python scales on the human scale, but I feel like those are being solved by things
    like the type annotations, for example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On very large Python projects, where you have a mix of junior and senior developers,
    it can be a lot of effort for junior developers to understand how to use an existing
    library or application, because they're coming from a more statically-typed language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    adopting type annotations, maybe not so much to help with the performance of the
    applications, but to help with the onboarding of new developers. I think that's
    going a long way in helping Python to continue to scale on a human scale.

    community are the two things that make Python still compelling even after 23 years,

    some of those technical limitations, which are completely doable, then we're really

    to Python 3 in their plans.

    benefits I think. The first is that it provided a very stable version of Python,

    in Python every 18 months (the typical length of time new versions are in development).

    life in mid-2020 and that's about right, although not soon enough for me! At some

    branch to remove the GIL), it's very complex, because it has to maintain compatibility

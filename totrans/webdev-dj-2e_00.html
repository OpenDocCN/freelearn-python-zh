			<p>Do you want to develop reliable and secure applications that stand out from the crowd, rather than spending hours on boilerplate code? If so, the Django framework is where you should begin. Often referred to as a "batteries included" web development framework, Django comes with all the core features needed to build a standalone application. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Web Development with Django</em> takes this philosophy and equips you with the knowledge and confidence to build real-world applications using Python.</p>
			<p>Starting with the essential concepts of Django, you'll cover its major features by building a website called Bookr – a repository for book reviews. This end-to-end case study is split into a series of bitesize projects that are presented as exercises and activities, allowing you to challenge yourself in an enjoyable and attainable way.</p>
			<p>As you progress, you'll learn various practical skills, including how to serve static files to add CSS, JavaScript, and images to your application, how to implement forms to accept user input, and how to manage sessions to ensure a reliable user experience. Throughout this book, you'll cover key daily tasks that are part of the development cycle of a real-world web application. </p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll have the skills and confidence to creatively tackle your own ambitious projects with Django.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Conventions</h2>
			<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, and user input are shown as follows: "It is created and scaffolded by running the <code>django-admin.py</code> command on the command line with the <code>startproject</code> argument."</p>
			<p>Words that you see on screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, also appear in the text like this: "In the <code>Preferences List</code> pane on the left, open the <code>Project: Bookr</code> item and then click <code>Project Interpreter</code>."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<pre>urlpatterns = [path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\
               path('', reviews.views.index)]</pre>
			<p>In cases where inputting and executing some code gives an immediate output, this is shown as follows:</p>
			<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; qd.getlist("k")
['a', 'b', 'c']</pre>
			<p>In the preceding example, the code entered is <code>qd.getlist("k")</code> and the output is <code>['a', 'b', 'c']</code>.</p>
			<p>New terms and important words are shown like this: "Django models define the data for your application and provide an abstraction layer to SQL database access through an <strong class="bold">Object Relational Mapper</strong> (<strong class="bold">ORM</strong>)."</p>
			<p>Lines of code that span multiple lines are split using a backslash ( \ ). When the code is executed, Python will ignore the backslash, and treat the code on the next line as a direct continuation of the current line.</p>
			<p>For example: </p>
			<pre>urlpatterns = [path('admin/', admin.site.urls), \ 
               path('', reviews.views.index)]</pre>
			<p>Long code snippets are truncated and the corresponding names of the code files on GitHub are placed at the top of the truncated code. The permalinks to the entire code are placed beneath the code snippet. It should look as follows:</p>
			<pre>settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = ['django.contrib.admin',\
                  'django.contrib.auth',\
                  'django.contrib.contenttypes',\
                  'django.contrib.sessions',\
                  'django.contrib.messages',\
                  'django.contrib.staticfiles',\
                  'reviews']

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Before You Begin</h2>
			<p>Each great journey begins with a humble step. Before we can do awesome things with Django, we need to be prepared with a productive environment. In this section, we will see how to do that.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Installing Python</h2>
			<p>Before using Django version 3 or later, you will need Python 3 installed on your computer. Mac and Linux operating systems usually have some version of Python installed, but it's best to make sure you're running the latest version. On Mac, for Homebrew users, you can just type the following:</p>
			<pre>$ brew install python</pre>
			<p>On Debian-based Linux distributions, you can check which version is available by typing the following:</p>
			<pre>$ apt search python3</pre>
			<p>Depending on the output, you can then type something along the lines of the following:</p>
			<pre>$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip</pre>
			<p>For Windows, you can download the Python 3 installer here: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/</a>. Once you have the installer, click on it to run, and then follow the instructions. Be sure to select the <strong class="bold">Add Python 3.x to PATH</strong> option.</p>
			<p>Once installed, from Command Prompt, you can run <code>python</code> to launch a Python interpreter.</p>
			<p>Note that on macOS and Linux, depending on your configuration, the <code>python</code> command might launch Python version 2 or Python version 3. To be sure, make sure to specify <code>python3</code>. On Windows, you should just run <code>python</code> as this will always launch Python version 3.</p>
			<p>Similarly with the <code>pip</code> command. On macOS and Linux, specify <code>pip3</code>; on Windows, just <code>pip</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Installing PyCharm Community Edition</h2>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Web Development with Django</em>, we will be using PyCharm <strong class="bold">Continuity Edition</strong> (<strong class="bold">CE</strong>) as our <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) for editing our code as well as running and debugging it. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/</a>. Once you have the installer, follow the instructions to install it in the usual way for your operating system.</p>
			<p>You can find detailed installation instructions for macOS, Linux, and Windows at this link: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#standalone</a>. The system requirements for PyCharm can be found here: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#requirements">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#requirements</a>. For more information on accessing PyCharm after installation, you can follow this link: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/run-for-the-first-time.html">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/run-for-the-first-time.html</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>virtualenv</h2>
			<p>Though not required, we recommend using a Python virtual environment, which will keep the Python packages for <em class="italic">Web Development with Django</em> separate from your system packages.</p>
			<p>First, we'll look at how to set up a virtual environment on macOS and Linux. The <code>virtualenv</code> Python package needs to be installed, and this can be done with <code>pip3</code>:</p>
			<pre>$ pip3 install virtualenv</pre>
			<p>Then we can create a virtual environment in the current directory:</p>
			<pre>$ python3 -m virtualenv &lt;virtualenvname&gt;</pre>
			<p>Once the virtual environment has been created, we need to source it so that the current terminal knows to use that environment's Python and packages. This is done like this:</p>
			<pre>$ source &lt;virtualenvname&gt;/bin/activate</pre>
			<p>On Windows, we can use the built-in <code>venv</code> library, which works in a similar manner. We don't need to install anything. To create a virtual environment in the current directory, we can run the following command:</p>
			<pre>&gt; python -m venv &lt;virtualenvname&gt;</pre>
			<p>Once it has been created, activate it with the activate script inside the <code>Scripts</code> directory, which is inside the new virtual environment:</p>
			<pre>&gt; &lt;virtualenvname&gt;\Scripts\activate</pre>
			<p>In macOS, Linux, and Windows, you will know that the virtual environment has been activated because its name, in brackets, will precede the prompt. For example:</p>
			<pre>(virtualenvname) $ </pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Installing Django</h2>
			<p>After activating your virtual environment, install Django using <code>pip3</code> or <code>pip</code> (depending on your operating system):</p>
			<pre>(virtualenvname)$ pip3 install django</pre>
			<p>As long as your virtual environment has been activated, it will use the version of <code>pip</code> in that environment and install packages in that environment too.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Django 3.0 and Django 3.1</h2>
			<p>From Django 3.1 onward, the authors of Django changed the method by which paths are joined together in the Django settings file. We'll explain the settings file in depth in <em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Introduction to Django</em>, but for now you just need to know that this file is called <code>settings.py</code>. </p>
			<p>In earlier versions, the <code>BASE_DIR</code> setting variable (the path to your project on disk) was created as a string, like this:</p>
			<pre>BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))</pre>
			<p>The <code>os</code> package was imported into <code>settings.py</code>, and paths joined with the <code>os.path.join</code> function. For example:</p>
			<pre>STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")  # Django 3.0 and earlier</pre>
			<p>In Django 3.1, <code>BASE_DIR</code> is now a <code>pathlib.Path</code> object. It is assigned like this:</p>
			<pre>BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent</pre>
			<p>Path objects and strings can be joined using the <code>/</code> (divide) operator that <code>pathlib.Path</code> overloads:</p>
			<pre>STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "static"  # Django 3.1+</pre>
			<p>The <code>os.path.join</code> function can also be used to join <code>pathlib.Path</code> objects, provided that it has been imported into <code>settings.py</code> first.</p>
			<p>Since most Django projects in production today use versions of Django prior to 3.1, we've chosen to use the <code>os.path.join</code> function to join paths throughout this book. When you create a new Django project, it will be with the latest version of Django, which will be higher than 3.1. So, to ensure compatibility, you just need to make sure that you add a line to import the <code>os</code> module at the start of <code>settings.py</code>, like so:</p>
			<pre>import os</pre>
			<p>Once added, you can follow the instructions throughout the book without modification. We'll remind you to make this change when you start working with <code>settings.py</code>, too.</p>
			<p>Apart from this minor addition, no modifications need to be done to the code examples, exercises, and activities throughout this book to support Django 3.0 or 3.1. While we can never be 100% certain, we are confident that this code will work fine with future versions of Django too. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>DB Browser for SQLite</h2>
			<p>This book uses SQLite as an on-disk database when developing your projects. Django provides a command-line interface for accessing its data using the text command, but GUI applications are also available to make data browsing friendlier.</p>
			<p>The tool we recommend is <strong class="bold">DB Browser for SQLite</strong>, or just <strong class="bold">DB Browser</strong> for short. It is a cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux) GUI application.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Installing on Windows</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Download the installer for the correct architecture of Windows (32-bit or 64-bit) from <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/">https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/</a>.</li>
				<li>Run the downloaded installer and follow the Setup Wizard instructions:<div><img src="img/B15509_00_01.jpg" alt="Figure 0.1: Setup Wizard page&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.1: Setup Wizard page</p></li>
				<li>After accepting <code>End-User License Agreement</code>, you'll be asked to select shortcuts for the application. It is recommended that you enable <code>Desktop</code> and <code>Program Menu</code> shortcuts for DB Browser so that once installed, the application is easier to find:<div><img src="img/B15509_00_02.jpg" alt="Figure 0.2: Page where you can select shortcuts for the application&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.2: Page where you can select shortcuts for the application</p></li>
				<li>You should be fine to follow the defaults by just clicking <code>Next</code> at each screen throughout the installation.</li>
				<li>If you didn't add <code>Program Menu</code> or <code>Desktop</code> shortcuts in <em class="italic">step 3</em>, then you'll need to find DB Browser in <code>C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Installing on macOS</h2>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Download the application disk image for macOS from <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/">https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/</a>.</li>
				<li>Once the download has finished, open the disk image. You'll see a window like this:<div><img src="img/B15509_00_03.jpg" alt="Figure 0.3: Disk image&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.3: Disk image</p><p>Drag and drop the <code>DB Browser for SQLite</code> application to the <code>Applications</code> folder to install it.</p></li>
				<li>Once installed, you can launch <code>DB Browser for SQLite</code> from inside your <code>Applications</code> folder.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Installing on Linux</h2>
			<p>The installation instructions for Linux will depend on which distribution you're using. You can find the instructions at <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/">https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Using DB Browser</h2>
			<p>Here are a few screenshots illustrating a couple of the features of DB Browser. The screenshots were taken on macOS, but the behavior is similar on all platforms. The first step after opening is to select your SQLite database file:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15509_00_04.jpg" alt="Figure 0.4: Database open dialogue&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.4: Database open dialogue</p>
			<p>Once a database file is open, we can explore its structure in the <code>Database Structure</code> tab. <em class="italic">Figure 0.5</em> demonstrates this:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15509_00_05.jpg" alt="Figure 0.5: Database Structure with one table expanded&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.5: Database Structure with one table expanded</p>
			<p>The <code>reviews_book</code> table has been expanded in the preceding screenshot so that we can see its table structure. We can also browse the data inside tables by switching to the <code>Browse Data</code> tab:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15509_00_06.jpg" alt="Figure 0.6: Data in the reviews_book table&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.6: Data in the reviews_book table</p>
			<p>The final thing we might want to do is execute SQL commands (you'll learn about these in <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Models and Migrations</em>). This is done inside the <code>Execute SQL</code> tab:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15509_00_07.jpg" alt="Figure 0.7: SQL command executed with the results showing&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.7: SQL command executed with the results showing</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 0.7</em> shows the results of executing the SQL statement <code>SELECT * FROM reviews_book</code>.</p>
			<p>Don't worry if you're not sure what this all means yet (at this point you don't even have an SQLite file to try this out on). It will make more sense once you start learning about Django models, databases, and SQL queries as you progress through the book. <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Models and Migrations</em>, is where you'll start working with DB Browser.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>The Bookr Project</h2>
			<p>Throughout this book, you'll be progressively building an app called <strong class="bold">Bookr</strong>. It is designed to let users browse and add book reviews (and books as well). As you complete the exercises and activities in each chapter, you'll be adding more features to the application. The GitHub repository for this book contains individual folders for the exercises and activities. These folders will usually include the files where the code of the app has changed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>The Final Directory</h2>
			<p>Each chapter's code will also have a directory called <code>final</code>. This directory will include all the code written for the app through to the end of that chapter. So, for example, the <code>final</code> folder for <em class="italic">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Serving Static Files</em>, will contain the full code for the Bookr app until the end of that chapter. That way, if you lose progress, you can use the code in the <code>final</code> folder of, say, <code>Chapter 5</code>, to start <code>Chapter 6</code>. </p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows how the directory structure would appear for a chapter after downloading the code from the GitHub repo to disk (refer to the <em class="italic">Installing the Code Bundle</em> section for more details on how to download the code from the repo):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15509_00_08.jpg" alt="Figure 0.8: Chapter-level directory structure for Bookr&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.8: Chapter-level directory structure for Bookr</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Populating the Data</h2>
			<p>When you reach <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Models and Migrations</em>, it is recommended that you populate your database with the list of sample books we have provided so that your end result remains more or less similar to ours. Make sure you don't skip the section entitled <em class="italic">Populating the Bookr Database</em> in <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Models and Migrations</em>, wherein we have provided a tiny script that lets you quickly populate the database.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Installing the Code Bundle</h2>
			<p>Download the code files from GitHub at <a href="http://packt.live/3nIWPvB">http://packt.live/3nIWPvB</a>. Refer to these code files for the complete code bundle. The files here contain the exercises, activities, activity solutions, bonus chapters, and some intermediate code for each chapter.</p>
			<p>On the GitHub repo's page, you can click the green <code>Code</code> button and then click the <code>Download ZIP</code> option to download the complete code as a ZIP file to your disk (refer to <em class="italic">Figure 0.9</em>). You can then extract these code files to a folder of your choice, for example, <code>C:\Code</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15509_00_09.jpg" alt="Figure 0.9: Download ZIP option&#13;&#10;"/>

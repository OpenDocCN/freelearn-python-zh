    that has three separate processes, as follows:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intuitively, we have every reason to implement a specification that allows the
    first process to have the highest priority of execution and access to resources,
    then the second process, and then the last process, with the lowest priority.
    However, imagine situations in which the first two processes (with higher priorities)
    run so often that the third process cannot execute its instructions; anytime the
    third process needs to run, it checks to see whether the resources are available
    to be used and finds out that one of the other higher-priority processes is using
    them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a situation of starvation – the third process is given no opportunity
    to execute and, therefore, no progress can be made with that process. In a typical
    concurrent program, it is quite common to have more than three processes at different
    priority levels, yet the situation is fundamentally similar – some processes are
    given more opportunities to run and, therefore, they are constantly executing.
    Others have lower priorities and cannot access the necessary resources to execute.

- en: In the next few subsections, we will be discussing the potential candidates
    that cause starvation situations. Most of the time, a poorly coordinated set of
    *scheduling instructions* is the main cause of starvation. For example, a considerably
    naive algorithm that deals with three separate tasks might implement constant
    communication and interaction between the first two tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This setup leads to the fact that the execution flow of the algorithm switches
    solely between the first and second tasks, while the third finds itself idle and
    unable to make any progress with its execution – in this case, because it is starved
    of CPU execution flow. Intuitively, we can identify the root of the problem as
    the fact that the algorithm allows the first two tasks to always dominate the
    CPU and, hence, effectively prevents any other task from also utilizing the CPU.
    A characteristic of a good scheduling algorithm is the ability to distribute the
    execution flow and allocate the resources equally and appropriately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As mentioned previously, many concurrent systems and programs implement a specific
    order of priority, in terms of process and thread execution. This implementation
    of ordered scheduling may very likely lead to the starvation of processes and
    threads of lower priorities and can result in a condition called **priority inversion**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose that, in your concurrent program, you have process A of the highest
    priority, process B of a medium priority, and finally, process C of the lowest
    priority; process C would most likely be put in the situation of starvation. Additionally,
    if the execution of process A, the prioritized process, is dependent on the completion
    of process C, which is already in starvation, then process A might never be able
    to complete its execution either, even though it is given the highest priority
    in the concurrent program.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a readers-writers problem, first and foremost, we have a shared resource,
    which, in most cases, is a text file. Different threads interact with that text
    file; each is either a reader or a writer. A **reader** is a thread that simply
    accesses the shared resource (the text file) and reads in the data included in
    that file, while a **writer** is a thread that accesses, and possibly mutates,
    the contents of the text file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know that writers and readers cannot access the shared resources simultaneously
    since if a thread is writing data to the file, no other thread should be accessing
    the file to read any data from it. The goal of the readers-writers problem is
    therefore to find a correct and efficient way to design and coordinate the scheduling
    of these reader and writer threads. Successful implementation of that goal is
    not only that the program as a whole executes in the most optimized way but also
    that all threads are given sufficient opportunity to execute their instructions
    and no starvation can occur. Additionally, the shared resource (the text file)
    needs to be handled appropriately so that no data will be corrupted.

    problem with increasing levels of complexity. From there, we will also implement
    sample solutions to these problems, thus gaining hands-on experience in preventing
    starvation in concurrent applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first readers-writers problem
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we mentioned, the problem asks us to come up with a scheduling algorithm
    so that readers and writers can access the text file appropriately and efficiently,
    without mishandling or corrupting the data that is included. A naive solution
    to this problem is to impose a lock on the text file so that it becomes a non-shareable
    resource; this means that only one thread (either a reader or a writer) can access
    (and potentially manipulate) the text file at any given time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet, this approach simply equates to a sequential program – if the shared resource
    can be utilized by only one thread at a given time, none of the processing time
    between different threads can be overlapped and, effectively, the execution becomes
    sequential. Therefore, this is not an optimal solution, as it is taking advantage
    of concurrent programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One insight regarding the reader threads can lead to a more optimal solution
    to this problem – since readers simply read in the text file and do not alter
    the data in it, multiple readers can be allowed to access the text file simultaneously.
    Indeed, even if more than one reader is fetching data from the text file at the
    same time, the data is not being changed in any way, and the consistency and accuracy
    of the data are therefore maintained.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Following this approach, we will implement a specification in which no reader
    will be kept waiting if the shared resource is being opened for reading by another
    reader. Specifically, in addition to a lock on the shared resource, we will also
    have a counter for the number of readers currently accessing the resource. If
    at any point in the program that counter goes from zero to one (in other words,
    at least one reader is starting to access the resource), we will lock the resource
    from the writers; similarly, whenever the counter decreases to zero (in other
    words, no reader is asking for access to the resource), we will release the lock
    on the resource so that writers can access it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This specification is efficient for the readers in the sense that once the first
    reader has accessed the resource and placed a lock on it, no writers can access
    it, and the subsequent readers will not have to re-lock it until the last reader
    finishes reading the resource.

    the code for this book from the GitHub page, go ahead and navigate to the `Chapter13`

    the `writer()` and `reader()` functions, as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the preceding script, the `writer()` function, which is to be called by a
    `threading.Thread` instance (in other words, a separate thread), specifies the
    logic of the writer threads that we discussed previously – accessing the shared
    resource (in this case, the global variable, `text`, which is simply a Python
    string) and writing some data to the resource. Note that we are putting all of
    its instructions inside a `while` loop to simulate the constant nature of the
    application (writers and readers constantly trying to access the shared resource).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also see the reader logic in the `reader()` function. Before asking for
    access to the shared resource, each reader will increment a counter for the number
    of readers that are currently active and trying to access the resource. Similarly,
    after reading data off the file, each reader needs to decrement the number of
    readers. During this process, if a reader is the first reader to access the file
    (in other words, when the counter is one), it will put a lock on the file so that
    no writers can access it; conversely, when a reader is the last reader to read
    the file, it has to release that lock.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One note about the handling of that counter of readers – you might have noticed
    that we are using a lock object named `rcounter` when incrementing/decrementing
    the counter variable (`rcount`). This is a method that is used to avoid a race
    condition, which is another common concurrency-related problem, for the counter
    variable; specifically, without the lock, multiple threads can be accessing and
    altering the counter variable at the same time, but the only way to ensure the
    integrity of the data is for this counter variable to be handled sequentially.
    We will discuss race conditions (and the practice that is used to avoid them)
    in more detail in the next chapter.

    the threads that were accessing the shared resource were readers. In fact, throughout
    my entire output, no writer was able to access the file and, therefore, the `text`
    variable only contains the initial string, `This is some text.`, and was not altered
    in any way. The output that you obtain should also have the same pattern (the
    shared resource not being altered).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, the writers are experiencing starvation, as none of them are able
    to access and use the resource. This is a direct result of our scheduling algorithm;
    since multiple readers are allowed to access the text file simultaneously, if
    there are multiple readers accessing the text file frequently enough, it will
    create a continuous stream of readers going through the text file, leaving no
    room for a writer to attempt to access the file.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The problem with the first approach is that when a reader is accessing the text
    file and a writer is waiting for the file to be unlocked, if another reader starts
    its execution and wants to access the file, it will be given priority over the
    writer that has already been waiting. Additionally, if more and more readers keep
    requesting access to the file, the writer will be waiting indefinitely, and that
    was what we observed in our first code example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address this problem, we will implement the specification that once a writer
    makes a request to access the file, no reader should be able to jump in line and
    access the file before that writer. To do this, we will have an additional lock
    object in our program to specify whether a writer is waiting for the file and,
    consequently, whether a reader thread can attempt to read the file; we will call
    this lock `read_try`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to how the first of the readers accessing the text file always locks
    it from the writers, we will now have the first of the multiple writers that are
    waiting to access the `read_try` file lock, so that no reader can, again, jump
    in line before those writers that requested access before it. As we discussed
    in reference to the readers, since we are keeping track of the number of writers
    waiting for the text file, we will need to implement a counter for the number
    of writers, and its corresponding lock, in our program.

    the same (except for the initialization of the `read_try` lock, the `wcount` counter,
    and its lock, `wcounter`), but in our `writer()` function, we are locking `read_try`
    as soon as there is at least one writer waiting to access the file; when the last
    writer finishes its execution, it will release the lock so that any reader waiting
    for the file can now access it.

    (indicated by the first four lines of my output), once a writer gained access
    to the shared resource, no reader was able to access it anymore. The rest of my
    output included messages about writing instructions – `Writing being done by`,
    and so on. As opposed to what we saw in the first solution of the readers-writers
    problem, this solution is giving priority to writers, and, as a consequence, the
    readers are starved. This is therefore called **writer preference**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The priority that writers were given over readers resulted from the fact that
    while only the first and the last writers have to acquire and release the `read_try`
    lock respectively, each reader wanting to access the text file has to interact
    with that lock object individually. Once `read_try` is locked by a writer, no
    reader can even attempt to execute its instructions, let alone try to access the
    text file.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    if the readers are initialized and executed before the writers (for example, in
    our program, the readers were the first three elements, and the writers were the
    last two, in our list of threads). However, once a writer is able to access the
    file and acquire the `read_try` lock during its execution, starvation will most
    likely occur for the readers.

    starve the writers, and the other can starve the readers. A balance between these
    two approaches might give us an implementation with equal priorities among the
    readers and writers, and, hence, solve the problem of starvation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recall that – in our second approach, we placed a lock on a reader's attempt
    to access the text file, requiring that no writer would be starved once it started
    waiting for the file. In this solution, we will implement a lock that also utilizes
    this logic but is then applied to both readers and writers. All of the threads
    will then be subjected to the constraints of the lock, and equal priority will
    hence be achieved among the separate threads.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Specifically, this is a lock that specifies whether a thread will be given access
    to the text file at a given moment; we will call this the **service lock**. Each
    writer or reader has to try to acquire this service lock before executing any
    of its instructions. A writer, having obtained this service lock, will also attempt
    to obtain the resource lock and release the service lock immediately thereafter.
    The writer will then execute its writing logic and finally release the resource
    lock at the end of its execution.

    gradually increasing priority to threads that have been waiting in the queue for
    a long time, or if a thread has been able to access the shared resource many times,
    it will be given less priority.'

- en: Solving starvation in your concurrent program can be a rather complex and involved
    process, and a deep understanding of its scheduling algorithm, combined with an
    understanding of how processes and threads interact with the shared resources,
    is necessary during the process. As you saw in the example of the readers-writers
    problem, it can also take several implementations and revisions of different approaches
    to arrive at a good solution to starvation.

- en: In this chapter, we have covered starvation and the specific situations in which
    it could occur by analyzing different instances of the readers-writers problem.
    We have gained insight into how starvation can be solved with different scheduling
    algorithms – by making sure that the priority is distributed appropriately among
    different processes and threads, starvation can be eliminated. These discussions
    will serve as a guide to solutions to real-life instances of starvation.

    concurrent programming – **race conditions**. We will cover the basic foundation
    and causes of race conditions, relevant concepts, and the connection of race conditions
    to other concurrency-related problems.

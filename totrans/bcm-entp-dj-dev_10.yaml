- en: In this part, you will be introduced to more advanced components of the Django
    framework. While the Django REST Framework is a completely separate package, it
    is a dependency that is made specifically to extend onto the Django framework,
    allowing us to build an API. You will learn about how the REST framework is used
    in a Django environment and how it can be used in combination with the Django
    template language. This part will also introduce packages used to test classes
    and methods found throughout a Django project, allowing developers to write custom
    test scripts. Lastly, you will learn about how to optimize database queries and
    manage data within a project.

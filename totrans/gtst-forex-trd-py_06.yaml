    for yourself because you heard that modern analysts use advanced computer technologies
    and come from the world of data science. However, there is a crucial difference
    between the two concepts; thus, the mathematical and computer inventory used with
    each of them is radically different. Moreover, their use in actual trading algorithms
    is also quite different. Let’s have a deeper look into both and see how (and if)
    we can use them in our applications.

    it meant minting coins, then printing the bills, and today, it also (and mostly)
    means making changes in databases electronically.

    central bank doesn’t just give money away to banks for free – banks pay *interest*
    to the central bank at a rate that is consequently called the *interest rate*.
    Banks also lend money to their clients – retail, businesses, and other banks –
    at different interest rates, which are, of course, greater than the rate at which
    they borrow from the central bank. And when your broker provides you with a credit
    line to facilitate margin trading (see [*Chapter 3*](B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044),
    *FX Market Overview from a Developer’s Standpoint*, in the *Trade mechanics –
    some terminology* section), they do not provide it for free, but rather at a rate
    that is, again, slightly higher than the rate at which they can borrow it.

    buy the British pound by selling the Japanese yen – you benefit from an interest
    rate differential of about 5% per annum, which you *receive* every night. On the
    contrary, if you sold GBPJPY in 2007, then you would *pay* the interest every
    night. Now, multiply these numbers by the leverage provided by the broker (and
    back in 2007, in certain cases, it could reach 700:1 for select clients!) and

    The point here is that although stocks and equities are more affected by the economic

    interest rates also affect the cost of investment into stocks and equities. Therefore,
    releases of important macroeconomic news (especially GDP, jobless rate, and CPI)

    price movements in currencies before and after the publication of these economic

- en: Python is one of the evolving language of our era, and it's gaining a lot of
    attention these days. It is one of the powerful and flexible open source languages
    instilled with powerful libraries. For every python developer, Requests is the
    library that comes to mind first when he/she needs to interact with the Web. With
    its batteries included Requests turned the process of interacting with Web a cakewalk
    and stands as one of the world's best client with more than 42 million downloads.

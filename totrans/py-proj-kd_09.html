You learned about these functions <a id="id299" class="indexterm"/>so that you can build a new game called <span class="strong"><strong>Tiny Tennis</strong></span>. Tiny Tennis will be a two-player game that uses the keys on a keyboard to control two paddles, which hit a ball back and forth. While this game seems simple when you watch it, there are many different parts needed to make the game playable.</p><div class="section" title="Introduction to game programming principles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec64"/>Introduction to game programming principles</h1></div></div></div><p>There are many principles<a id="id300" class="indexterm"/> of game programming that apply to our project in this chapter. First, remember that the movement of objects in space is an illusion that we create. Unlike reality, objects that we create will appear to move because we will regularly draw and then redraw the objects in different places.</p><p>Another principle that we have discussed is a game loop. The game loop is important as it controls all of the things that need to happen in the game, including the moving and redrawing of objects. The timing of the game loop is important as this will tell the computer how many times to <a id="id301" class="indexterm"/>run the game loop. Each time a game loop runs is also known as a <span class="strong"><strong>frame</strong></span>, and the speed at which the game loop runs is known as the <span class="strong"><strong>frame rate</strong></span>.</p><p>Finally, considering how the<a id="id302" class="indexterm"/> player interacts with the game is an important part of the game design. This means that we will consider how the player uses keys and has their score stored in the program's memory and displayed somewhere on the screen.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The game plan"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec65"/>The game plan</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we start to <a id="id303" class="indexterm"/>write any lines of code, we need to have our Python shell, terminal, and text editor open. We will be switching back and forth between these tools as we write and test lines of code throughout the chapter. Set up your monitor so that you are comfortable switching between each window.</p><p>Once you set up your workspace, go to the text editor window. We are going to outline our game in the text editor window using comments so that we can better organize our work.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating an outline of game parts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec66"/>Creating an outline of game parts</h1></div></div></div><p>We are going to work <a id="id304" class="indexterm"/>on this game in four sections. The sections of the game are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Section 1: imports, globals, and drawings</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Section 2: moving the paddles</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Section 3: moving the ball</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Section 4: draw screen and track the score</li></ul></div><p>Create a file called <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> in your text editor. Then, type the following lines into your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong># imports, globals and drawing</strong></span>

<span class="strong"><strong># moving the paddles</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong># moving the ball</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong># keeping score</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Once you are done typing the preceding lines, save your file. This file now provides a general outline of the work that needs to be done to create your game. Here is how your file will look:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_01.jpg" alt="Creating an outline of game parts"/></div><p>We are following one particular approach to making this game of Tiny Tennis. It is important to note that there are <span class="emphasis"><em>MANY</em></span> possible ways to write this game code. The way we are doing it here allows us to review all of the concepts that we learned along the way in this book. At the end of this chapter as well as in the next chapter, we will discuss some more advanced (and more streamlined) coding techniques that you can use to make this game do more things and do them more efficiently. Right now, though, let's start this game!</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Section 1 &#x2013; imports, globals, and drawings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec67"/>Section 1 – imports, globals, and drawings</h1></div></div></div><p>In this first section, we will<a id="id305" class="indexterm"/> write all of the code to set up the different parts of our game. This<a id="id306" class="indexterm"/> includes importing libraries, defining all of our global<a id="id307" class="indexterm"/> variables, and telling the computer how<a id="id308" class="indexterm"/> to draw the <a id="id309" class="indexterm"/>screen, ball, and paddles.</p><div class="section" title="Importing libraries"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec56"/>Importing libraries</h2></div></div></div><p>The first lines of code we write will be used to import the necessary libraries into the game, including<a id="id310" class="indexterm"/> pygame. We will be using three libraries in the game: pygame, math, and random. pygame, as we discussed in the previous chapter, allows us to have visual elements in our game. The random library, included with Python, gives us the ability to select and use random numbers in our game. The math library, also included with Python, allows for mathematics with floating point numbers. To use these modules and libraries in your code, type the following lines into your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file underneath the #imports, globals, and drawing comment:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>import pygame</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>import random</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>import time</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip09"/>Tip</h3><p>Make sure to save your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file now that you have added some new lines. Be in the habit of saving your code as <span class="emphasis"><em>OFTEN</em></span> as you can.</p></div></div><p>You can make comments in your code if it helps you to organize your thoughts. Now, we will also initialize pygame so that we are able to use all of the capabilities, including starting our screen, drawing graphics, and running our game loop. To initialize pygame, we use the <code class="literal">init()</code> function. To initialize it, type these two lines of code below your imports:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  # initialize pygame</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  pygame.init()</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Using <code class="literal">pygame.init()</code> starts the pygame process, and the pygame process will keep running until the program stops running when the player quits pygame. This allows us to access everything inside of pygame throughout the game. You will see how important this is as we continue to write our game. Right now, save your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file again:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_02.jpg" alt="Importing libraries"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Introducing globals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec57"/>Introducing globals</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that we have<a id="id311" class="indexterm"/> imported the libraries that we need, we will be making globals for some parts of the game. As a reminder, globals, or global variables, are variables that we can use throughout the entire file. We will set global variables for all of the colors that we wish to use. We also set global variables for the screen, paddles, and ball.</p></div><div class="section" title="Defining a color"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec58"/>Defining a color</h2></div></div></div><p>First, we will make globals for each color. Colors, as we learned in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. pygame">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>pygame</em></span>, are represented by three different numbers listed in parentheses, also called a tuple. Instead of having to write these numbers repeatedly, we will make a global variable for each color so that we can<a id="id312" class="indexterm"/> use the names of all of the colors throughout the game.</p><p>Depending on what colors you like, you might want to make global variables for all the colors or only for a few. It is really up to you to decide what colors to add to your code. Here is a list of common colors that you may wish to use in your game. You should add the code for each color exactly as it appears here:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  red = (255, 0, 0)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  orange = (255, 127, 0)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  yellow = (255, 255, 0)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  green: (0, 255, 0)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  blue = (0, 0, 255)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  violet = (127, 0, 255)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  brown = (102, 51, 0)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  black = (0, 0, 0)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  white = (255, 255, 255)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The preceding list shows the basic colors that you can include in your game code. If you want to include more advanced colors, you can search for <code class="literal">rgb color codes chart</code> in an Internet search engine, such as Google, and you will find that there are different variations for each color that you can change to your liking, such as light blue or dark blue. Once you have changed all the colors to your liking, make sure that you save your work:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_03.jpg" alt="Defining a color"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Adjusting the screen size"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec59"/>Adjusting the screen size</h2></div></div></div><p>We will also use<a id="id313" class="indexterm"/> globals to define the parts of our screen display. This lets us show the size, color, and text for the main screen. Here are the color globals; we will add these lines of code for the width and height of the screen:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  # screen globals</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  screen_width = 600</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  screen_height = 400</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Now that we have made the <code class="literal">screen_width</code> and <code class="literal">screen_height</code> variables, we can use these variables throughout our code, which makes our code easier to read. Also, if we do decide to change the screen width or screen height, we can change it one at a time in this global variable, and all of our code will still run properly.</p></div><div class="section" title="Drawing the screen"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec60"/>Drawing the screen</h2></div></div></div><p>So, the <code class="literal">screen_width</code> and <code class="literal">screen_height</code> variables are the basic information that pygame needs so that it <a id="id314" class="indexterm"/>can set up the actual game screen. pygame has a function called <code class="literal">pygame.display.set_mode()</code> that takes the variables of <code class="literal">screen_width</code> and <code class="literal">screen_height</code> to make the screen display. Now, writing <code class="literal">pygame.display.set_mode ((screen_width, screen_height))</code> is really long, especially if we keep<a id="id315" class="indexterm"/> doing it. Instead, we are going to set this to a global variable called <code class="literal">game_screen</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  game_screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))</strong></span>
</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Creating screen labels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec61"/>Creating screen labels</h2></div></div></div><p>The next set of functions that we use will set the text for the top of the screen and the font for the game screen. The<a id="id316" class="indexterm"/> first line of code defines what string of text we want to see, and in the following line, we define the font and size. If the font and the size are not available, the font will, by default, use whatever is originally set on your system. This is true for Windows, Mac, and Linux systems:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  pygame.display.set_caption("Tiny Tennis")</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  font = pygame.font.SysFont("monospace", 75)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>So, we have now set all of the basic variables needed to create a game screen. Save your work and, when you are ready, move on to making the global variables that we will need for the ball, paddles, and scoring. Your screen code should look like this code sample:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_04.jpg" alt="Creating screen labels"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Ball – the starting location"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec62"/>Ball – the starting location</h2></div></div></div><p>In Tiny Tennis, the ball is one of the most important parts of the game. We have a lot to do to make it work. First, we need to give the ball some global characteristics so that it can be drawn and redrawn to<a id="id317" class="indexterm"/> create the illusion of movement.</p><p>First, we need to set the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> coordinates of the ball. By making a global variable for this, we can tell the computer where to redraw the ball without having to write special code for each movement of the ball. We will set the default value of <code class="literal">x</code> and <code class="literal">y</code> so that the ball starts in the center of the screen. Write the next lines into your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  # ball globals</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  ball_x = int(screen_width / 2)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  ball_y = int(screen_height / 2)</strong></span>
</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Ball – setting the speed and direction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec63"/>Ball – setting the speed and direction</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that we have<a id="id318" class="indexterm"/> told the ball to start in the center of the screen as default, we <a id="id319" class="indexterm"/>need to tell the ball how far to move by giving it <code class="literal">x</code> and <code class="literal">y</code> coordinates for movement:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  ball_xv = 3</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  ball_yv = 3</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">ball_xv = 3</code> means that the ball will move <code class="literal">3</code> pixels along the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> axis each time it is redrawn. The <code class="literal">ball_yv = 3</code> means that the ball will move <code class="literal">3</code> pixels along the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> axis each time the screen redraws. This is great as it will help us keep the ball going in the speed and direction that we like. Here<span class="emphasis"><em>, v = velocity</em></span> which is the magnitude (speed) and direction (<span class="emphasis"><em>x,y</em></span>) of the ball. So, when we say <code class="literal">ball_xv = 3</code>, we are really saying that <span class="emphasis"><em>the ball moves along the x axis at a speed of 3 pixels each time the screen is redrawn</em></span>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Ball – setting the size"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec64"/>Ball – setting the size</h2></div></div></div><p>The final thing that <a id="id320" class="indexterm"/>we will define about the ball is its radius. The radius is half of the total width of the ball, as represented in pixels. By setting the radius, we set the size. Write the following line of code into your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file to represent the ball radius:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  ball_r = 20</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Now that we have defined the characteristics of the ball, make sure to save the file. Nobody wants to rewrite lines of working code! Take a look at an example of this section of code:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_05.jpg" alt="Ball – setting the size"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Paddles – starting location and size"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec65"/>Paddles – starting location and size</h2></div></div></div><p>In our game, we will have <a id="id321" class="indexterm"/>two paddles. Recall that in the beginning of this chapter, it was<a id="id322" class="indexterm"/> said that there is more than one way to do some of the things that we are doing. There are more advanced ways to make the paddles, but it is important that you understand each part of the paddle, so we are going to break our code down very simply. Later, once you have completed this game, you can do some research on creating objects and try creating paddles as objects.</p><p>We will give our<a id="id323" class="indexterm"/> paddle four qualities: a starting location on the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> axis, a starting location on<a id="id324" class="indexterm"/> the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> axis, a width, and a height. Each of these numbers is a representation in pixels. Below the ball globals, on line 34, add the next five lines to your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  # draw paddle 1</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  paddle1_x = 10</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  paddle1_y = 10</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  paddle1_w = 25</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  paddle1_h = 100</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>You probably noticed that the code we wrote is for <code class="literal">paddle1</code>. There are two paddles required for Tiny Tennis. We want to give each player a fair start, so we will create <code class="literal">paddle2</code> so that it is equal in size, but it's located opposite <code class="literal">paddle1</code>. To make the second paddle, start on line 40 and write the next five lines of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  # draw paddle 2</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  paddle2_x = screen_width - 35</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  paddle2_y = 10</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  paddle2_w = 25</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  paddle2_h = 100</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>You will notice that the <code class="literal">x</code> coordinate for paddle 2 combines <code class="literal">the screen_width</code> variable, which is the maximum <code class="literal">x</code> coordinate number (<code class="literal">600</code>) and then subtracts the width of the paddle (<code class="literal">25</code>) + the <code class="literal">x</code> coordinate value of paddle 1 (<code class="literal">10</code>) as well. This math allows us to make sure that the paddle is the same distance from the right-hand side of the screen as it is from the left-hand side of the screen. If you are confused, copy the code into your file and save it. You can play with the numbers and see how your paddles change based on each value:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_06.jpg" alt="Paddles – starting location and size"/></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Initializing the score"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec68"/>Initializing the score</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to have a score, we<a id="id325" class="indexterm"/> are going to create a variable for each player that begins at the default score, zero. As this is a global variable, like the other integers, it will change<a id="id326" class="indexterm"/> as the game loop runs. For now, we just need to have placeholders for each player. So, starting on line 46, add these lines of code to your game:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  # initialize score</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  player1_score = 0</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  player2_score = 0</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>We have now created all of the global variables that we need to write code that is easier to understand. Remember, these are called global variables because they can be used throughout the entire code file. Save your file. Then, compare your code with the completed code in this screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_07.jpg" alt="Initializing the score"/></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Testing section 1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec69"/>Testing section 1</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that we have imported libraries, initialized pygame, and created globals for colors, the screen, ball, and the paddles, we can run our first tests to check how things are going. To test the game, you will <a id="id327" class="indexterm"/>need to locate the directory where you saved your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file in your terminal/command prompt. In earlier games, we made this directory on the desktop. Once you navigate to the directory where <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> is saved, you can run the following commands from the terminal/command prompt to see your game so far:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  python tiny.py</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>When you run this command, you should see a window pop up and then close. The window will not stay open because we have not written any of the code that runs the game; however, if the code runs and there are <span class="emphasis"><em>NO ERRORS</em></span> in your terminal/command prompt, then you can keep moving forward with confidence.</p><p>If there are errors in your code, now is a good time to fix them. Some common errors that can take place include syntax errors (using the wrong symbols), typos (spelling something incorrectly, such as a Python keyword), or trying to run your file from the wrong directory. If you have errors, check for these common errors, and fix the mistakes in your code.</p><p>If you get an error that is not one of the aforementioned common errors, you can always perform an Internet search to ask a question about the problem you are having. It is very common for even experienced developers to use Internet searches to find help to fix errors, and there are many websites and blogs that people maintain in order to help others learn.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Section 2 &#x2013; moving the paddles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec70"/>Section 2 – moving the paddles</h1></div></div></div><p>Now we finally<a id="id328" class="indexterm"/> get to write the code that will make our paddles appear on the screen and allow us to control the paddle.</p><p>This is where we get the<a id="id329" class="indexterm"/> chance to use the logic and loops that we learned about in earlier chapters. In a game such as Tiny Tennis, many decisions are made very quickly. Computers are great at making fast decisions based on our instructions. Here are the parts of the code that will be in the next section:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating the <code class="literal">while</code> loop</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Key events</li></ul></div><p>We will code these next pieces step by step, and then test the code by running it to check whether there are any errors. It is suggested that you read through this whole section before you start coding so that you know what to expect. Once you have read through everything, the fun starts!</p><div class="section" title="Pre-loop actions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec66"/>Pre-loop actions</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we actually <a id="id330" class="indexterm"/>create the <code class="literal">while</code> loop, there are two actions that we will code. The first is to ensure that the cursor disappears when it goes over the game screen, so it is not an interruption. There is a special function for this behavior in pygame:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  pygame.mouse.set_visible(0)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>By setting the visibility to <code class="literal">0</code>, we make the mouse/cursor invisible to the game. Since we do not need the mouse in the game, it is okay for us to do this.</p><p>The second action is to set the global variable for our <code class="literal">while</code> loop. We are going to call our main game loop variable <code class="literal">do_main</code>. We will set <code class="literal">do_main = True</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  do_main = True</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip10"/>Tip</h3><p>Remember that syntax and case (uppercase or lowercase) are important. Notice the <span class="emphasis"><em>CAPITAL</em></span> letter <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span>, and make sure to copy it exactly as it is. Remember, <span class="emphasis"><em>True</em></span> is a Boolean that needs to be written with a capital <span class="emphasis"><em>T</em></span>. Now, we are ready to write our <code class="literal">while</code> loop.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Creating the while loop"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec67"/>Creating the while loop</h2></div></div></div><p>Our game loop <a id="id331" class="indexterm"/>will be a <code class="literal">while</code> loop. We will use <code class="literal">do_main</code> as our <code class="literal">True</code> statement. So, you will have another line of code that looks like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  while do_main:</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Make sure you place a colon (<code class="literal">:</code>) at the end of the line. Also, all of the other lines of code in the game loop will be indented at least once because they all need to be <span class="emphasis"><em>INSIDE</em></span> of the loop to run. Here is a screenshot of the <code class="literal">while</code> loop:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_08.jpg" alt="Creating the while loop"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Moving the paddles – keyboard events"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec68"/>Moving the paddles – keyboard events</h2></div></div></div><p>The first set of events<a id="id332" class="indexterm"/> in the <code class="literal">while</code> loop are keyboard events. These events take place when a key or set of keys get pressed. The events use the <code class="literal">if</code>/<code class="literal">elif</code> logic. All of them are indented on at least one tab, and some are indented on two tabs or more. Remember that indents are an organizational tool in Python and help us keep track of when certain code should be run.</p><p>Notice the code on line 54 of the screenshot. In line 54, we will create the pressed variable, which we will set equal to the <code class="literal">pygame.key.get_pressed()</code> function. This will give us a shorter reference to the function. Type this code in line 54:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    pressed = pygame.key.get_pressed()</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>In line 55, we use the <code class="literal">pygame.key.set_repeat()</code> function.

If the event is a <span class="emphasis"><em>QUIT</em></span> event, then the <code class="literal">while</code> loop will automatically end. You will notice that we also use our <code class="literal">if</code> logic here so that we can tell the computer to make a decision if it finds the quit event.

We will be changing the location of the ball with some of our code, and we will create something called collision detection.</p><div class="section" title="Moving the ball – updating the location"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec72"/>Moving the ball – updating the location</h2></div></div></div><p>First, we need to be constantly calculating the <code class="literal">x</code> and <code class="literal">y</code> coordinates of the ball based on the velocity of the ball that <a id="id343" class="indexterm"/>we set in the global variables. This allows us to make constant updates as long as we are playing the game. To make sure that the <code class="literal">x</code> and <code class="literal">y</code> coordinates of the ball update as the ball moves, you will type the following lines of code, starting from line 74:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    # location of ball is updated</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    ball_x += ball_xv</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    ball_y += ball_yv</strong></span>
</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Collision detection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec73"/>Collision detection</h2></div></div></div><p>Our next job is to code<a id="id344" class="indexterm"/> something called <span class="strong"><strong>collision detection</strong></span>. This means that we can program the computer to know when two objects are hitting one another. We can also tell the computer what we want it to do when the objects collide. In Tiny Tennis, we have three<a id="id345" class="indexterm"/> kinds of collisions that we want to detect:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Collision of the ball with the top and bottom of the screen</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Collision of the paddle with the top and bottom of the screen</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Collision of the ball with the paddle</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Collision of the ball with the top and the bottom of the screen"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec33"/>Collision of the ball with the top and the bottom of the screen</h3></div></div></div><p>Next, we will use <a id="id346" class="indexterm"/>our <code class="literal">if</code> statement to define what happens if the ball hits the top or the bottom of the screen. Basically, we want the ball to bounce back if it hits the top or bottom of the screen. Type the following code starting from line 77 of your <code class="literal">tiny.py</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    # collision of ball with top/bottom of screen</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    if ball_y - ball_r &lt;= 0 or ball_y + ball_r &gt;= screen_height:</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>        ball_yv *= -1</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The first line, beginning with <code class="literal">if</code>, basically says <span class="emphasis"><em>If the radius is subtracted from the y coordinate and that is less than or equal to zero OR if the radius is added to the y coordinate and it is greater than the number of the screen height (400), then do something about it</em></span>.</p><p>The second line of the code that comes after the colon tells us what to do: <span class="emphasis"><em>the velocity of the y coordinate of the ball should be in the reverse direction</em></span>. The second line of code, <code class="literal">ball_yv *= -1</code>, means that the velocity of the <code class="literal">y</code> coordinate gets reversed because it is multiplied by <code class="literal">-1</code>. Any number multiplied by <code class="literal">-1</code> becomes opposite to its original sign, and, in this case, reversing the sign means reversing the direction of the ball.</p><p>So, why does this code work? Let's think about it. The top <code class="literal">y</code> coordinate is zero. If the ball tries to move past the top, its <code class="literal">y</code> value will be less than zero, which means that it will be out of the screen. To make the ball stay on the screen, we change its direction when the <code class="literal">y</code> coordinate value is less than zero.</p><p>The bottom <code class="literal">y</code> coordinate is <code class="literal">400</code>. So, if the ball's <code class="literal">y</code> value is greater than <code class="literal">400</code>, then we change the direction of the ball to go back up. We make these directional changes by multiplying the velocity of the ball by <code class="literal">-1</code>, resulting in a directional change.</p><p>Before moving on, compare your code to this code:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_09_10.jpg" alt="Collision of the ball with the top and the bottom of the screen"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Collision of the paddle with the top and the bottom of screen"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec34"/>Collision of the paddle with the top and the bottom of screen</h3></div></div></div><p>We want the paddle to stop when it reaches the top or bottom of the screen. To make this happen, we need to create a<a id="id347" class="indexterm"/> code that will recognize the <code class="literal">y</code> value of the paddle and then stop the paddle from moving beyond the two <code class="literal">y</code> values that create the screen borders. These two values are <code class="literal">0</code> for the top of the screen, and <code class="literal">400</code> for the bottom. Copy the following lines of code into your program, starting from line 81. Check to make sure that your indent level is correct:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    # collision of paddle with top/bottom of screen</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    if paddle1_y &lt; 0:</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>        paddle1_y = 0</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    elif paddle1_y + paddle1_h &gt; screen_height:</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>        paddle1_y = screen_height - paddle1_h</strong></span>

<span class="strong"><strong>    if paddle2_y &lt; 0:</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>        paddle2_y = 0</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    elif paddle2_y + paddle2_h &gt; screen_height:</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>        paddle2_y = screen_height - paddle2_h</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>This code works differently from the ball code because we do not want the paddles to bounce around! Instead, we want the paddles to stop when they hit the top or bottom of the screen. So, you will notice that whenever paddle 1 or paddle 2 goes beyond the barriers of the screen (<code class="literal">0</code> and <code class="literal">400</code>), the value of the paddle is reset to <span class="emphasis"><em>EQUAL</em></span> the boundary values of <code class="literal">0</code> or <code class="literal">400</code>, depending on <span class="emphasis"><em>WHERE</em></span> the paddle is located (is it at the top of the screen or the bottom?). Save your work once you are done with adding this code.</p></div><div class="section" title="Collision of the ball with the paddles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl3sec35"/>Collision of the ball with the paddles</h3></div></div></div><p>The collision of the ball with the paddles will determine what happens when the ball hits the paddle. There are two paddles, and it will be helpful if you add some comment code using a hashtag to keep track of the code for the left-hand side paddle (paddle 1) and the right-hand side paddle (paddle 2).</p><p>Now that we have done<a id="id348" class="indexterm"/> some collision detection, let's think about the ball and paddle. When the ball hits the paddle, we want the ball to appear as though it has bounced off of the paddle. Therefore, we need to make sure that the result of the collision between the ball and the paddle is that the ball reverses itself and goes in the opposite direction. This is actually the same behavior that we used to make the ball bounce off the edges of the screen, except now we need to outline all the pieces of paddle 1 and paddle 2. Copy these lines of code into your file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    # left paddle</strong></span>

However, if the user misses the ball with the paddle, what <a id="id351" class="indexterm"/>happens to the ball? What happens to the player and their score?</p><p>In this section of the game, we <a id="id352" class="indexterm"/>use the location of the <code class="literal">x</code> coordinates to determine <a id="id353" class="indexterm"/>whether the ball is on the screen or it has gone past the paddles and is outside the screen. We use our <code class="literal">if</code> statement to tell the computer what to do. The <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> axis <code class="literal">0</code> coordinate is the left-most side of the screen. If the ball's <code class="literal">x</code> value is less than <code class="literal">0</code>, then the player on the other side (player 2) has scored a point because player 1 failed to block the ball. If you read the lines of code, you will notice that we reset the <code class="literal">ball_x</code> and <code class="literal">ball_y</code> coordinates to the center of the screen so that a new game can start. Copy the next four lines of code to place this logic into the game:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    if ball_x &lt;= 0:</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>      player2_score += 1</strong></span>

<span class="strong"><strong>      ball_y = int(screen_height / 2)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>You will notice that the next four lines of code are almost identical, with only two changes. The ball's <code class="literal">x</code> value is now being compared to the maximum screen width, which is <code class="literal">600</code>. If the ball's <code class="literal">x</code> value becomes greater than <code class="literal">600</code>, it means that the player has missed the ball and the ball is now outside of the screen. Now, player 1 has scored because player 2 did not block<a id="id354" class="indexterm"/> the ball. To make sure that this logic is also in the game, copy the<a id="id355" class="indexterm"/> next four lines of code into your file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    elif ball_x &gt;= screen_width:</strong></span>

The next lines of code draw the five objects that are a part of our game. There is no need to use variable names to draw the paddles, net, or the balls, except that it does make them easier to find if you want to fix or change that part of the code.

You can test the game by making sure that the paddles on each side of the screen are able to hit the ball and that they<a id="id362" class="indexterm"/> do not go outside of the screen space. You can test the scoring mechanism to make sure that the appropriate player is getting the points for each shot that they make past the other player. Then, you can invite others to play the game with you.</p><p>If you are not happy with parts of the game, you can change them. For example, you might choose a different color for the ball, paddles, and the screen. Maybe you want the paddles to be longer or shorter or, perhaps, thinner. Maybe you want to make the ball bigger or smaller by changing the radius.</p><p>You might decide that you want the ball and paddles to move faster so that the game is more challenging, or maybe you want the ball and paddles to move slower if you are designing the game to be played by younger children. Design choices are made for many reasons, and now that you have a playable game, you might decide to make some different design decisions.</p><p>You can test your decisions by making a copy of your game code and then testing any modifications in your <a id="id363" class="indexterm"/>copy. It is a good idea to keep a backup of your working code so that if you write broken code, you have a place to return to and start again.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec78"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Congratulations on building your first game! There are so many things that you learned to do. The greatest thing about code, though, is that there are many ways to do everything. Some ways are easier to understand but not as efficient as other ways. Some code is very efficient but might not be easily understood by another programmer. The best code is both easy to understand and written in the most efficient way possible.</p><p>Throughout the previous chapter, we used a combination of code that was easy to understand, but may not have been as efficient as possible. This is because we were learning many new principles in pygame, and things, such as collision detection, can be challenging to code. You may decide to do things differently after you have a few games under your belt!</p><p>In the next chapter, we will review all that we have learned in this book, and we will also take a look at some other ways that Python is used out in the world, as Python is a very useful language to know. See you in the last chapter!</p></div></body></html>

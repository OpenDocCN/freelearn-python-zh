    Certainly in some high-tech fiction or Marvel movies or even comic books. So,
    get your seat belt tight and get ready for this amazing chapter where you will
    actually be implementing what I just mentioned.

    Jarvis, some of which we have explored earlier such as controlling it through. So,
    to start with, we need to prepare our system to be able to do speech synthesis;
    to do that, let's perform the following process.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Here, we are using a method called `system()`; what this does is that it executes
    a shell command. You might be wondering what this is. A shell command is a command
    used by the user to access the functionality of a system to interact with it.
    So now that we want to convert our text to voice, we would be providing two arguments
    to this function. First, what is the text? In our case, it is `Hello from the
    other side`; the second argument that we have here is `festival --tts`. Now `festival`
    is a library, and `tts` stands for text to speech conversion. So when we pass
    it on to the argument, the system will know that the text passed on to the argument
    has to be converted from text to speech.

    to our doorsteps. Sometimes, you want them to know a few things about where to
    leave the parcel. Now that we are becoming more and more automated, gone are the
    days when you might leave a note outside your gate. It''s time to make something
    really interesting with our technology. To do that, we hardly need to do anything
    serious. All we need to do is to wire up the components as shown in the following

- en: In the previous chapter we have used a PIR sensor to sense any human activity,
    however the problem with the sensor is, that no matter who comes or leaves it
    would deliver the same message. That basically means that even when you come home
    after a long day, it would end up asking the same question. Pretty dumb huh?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So in this chapter we would use the previous repository and integrate the vision
    and the voice together to make an amazing duo. In this, the camera would identify
    who is on the gate and would recognize if it is a human and a stranger, if so
    then, it would deliver the message you intend to give. On the other hand if its
    you then it would simply let you pass with a simple greeting. However if the face
    is detected but not recognized then it would give a set of instructions to the
    person standing in-front of the camera.

    `BEN` can tell the Jarvis to turn on the lights, and the Jarvis would respond

    in a very short period of time. It is certainly faster and easier than typing.
    Hence, more and more companies are working toward making systems that understands
    human voice and language and work according to them. It is certainly not easy
    because of the huge variations that are present in the language; however, we have
    come a considerable distance. So without much time, let's make our system get
    ready to recognize our voice.

    is really good at understanding what you say. Like, very literally. So it makes
    sense to use their API. Now, the way it works is very simple. We capture the voice,
    and we convert it into the text. Then, we compare if the text is similar to something
    we have defined in the configuration file. If it matches with anything, the bash
    command associated with it will be executed.

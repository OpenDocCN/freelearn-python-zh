    a backtest, and generated our first equity curve (a visual representation of the
    strategy’s profits and losses over time). Intuitively, we already know that equity
    curves of profitable strategies should grow over time, and the steeper the growth,
    the better. At first glance, our strategy looks fit to this requirement, but of
    course, it would be better to be able to base our opinions on facts and not just
    emotions. So, we would like to have a quantitative metric that could be used as
    an indicator: if its value is greater than something, then the strategy is good.
    If it’s less, then the strategy is not good.'

    such a gain. Similarly, not only the overall net profit but also how profits (and
    losses!) are distributed over time matters. Ultimately, we want to be sure that

    will be considered trading and the resulting profit will be taxed at a full income

    and 2 pips with rare increases to 5 and more, typically before economic news.

    If the sizes of your orders never exceed top-of-book liquidity, then in the absolute
    majority of cases, the slippage would be zero. To get a more precise estimate,
    we need to analyze the top-of-book data at the time of the trade. If you trade
    with a retail broker, then you may have a hard time getting order book data –
    normally, brokers do not publish it. If you use a broker as an STP to get access
    directly to a trading venue, then you will get at least top-of-book data with
    volumes. Let’s do an estimate using LMAX data.

    time, EST/EDT). This is not the most liquid time, but on average, we can see 50,000
    to 200,000 AUD at the top of the book at that time. So, if your order size doesn’t
    exceed 50,000 AUD, then you can safely assume that slippage will be negligible.
    However, if your order size exceeds 50,000 AUD, then most likely you will experience
    slippage of up to 1 pip – depending on the actual trading volume. If the trading
    size exceeds 500,000 AUD, then the slippage may increase to 2 pips and even more.

    available according to your status: retail or professional. If you’re a retail
    trader, then most likely you will get a 30:1 leverage. If you’re a professional
    trader, then higher leverage such as 100:1 is available. However, as you will
    see later in this chapter (see the *The power of leverage – how much do I need
    to trade it?* section), it is highly unlikely that you’re going to use a leverage
    greater than 10:1\. Most likely, it is going to be somewhere in the vicinity of
    2:1-5:1\. In our example, in order to open a position of 200,000 AUD/USD with

    of about $15,000 seems adequate. Without any intention to count money in your
    pocket, let me suppose that if you’re a retail trader, then you will hardly open
    positions with a size greater than 200,000 AUD, so it is safe to suppose that

    account and your broker provides you with a retail leverage of 30:1, then you

    that would mean that we traded without leverage, and for unleveraged trading,
    the return indeed would make about 30% while the drawdown would remain acceptably
    low, around 6.5%.
  id: totrans-256
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, we trade with a leverage of 30:1\. This means that a pip value now equals
    $30, not $1\. Then, the return would make $30 * 3000 = $90,000 – what a handsome
    profit! If we present this figure as percent growth over the initial investment,
    we will have an incredible value of 900% in just 3 years. So, margin trading is
    a great benefit and the way to go, isn’t it?

    no because in this case, the drawdown would make up 100% of the trading account.
    I can’t imagine any trader, not commenting on investors, who would be able to
    withstand such a drawdown, even just psychologically.

    investor can afford to withstand a drawdown of 10% of the initial investment.
    Let’s also assume that the initial investment is $10,000\. Therefore, the maximum
    loss in the account should not ever exceed $1,000\. With a maximum strategy drawdown
    of 646 pips, the value of 1 pip can be equal to $1,000/646 = $1.54\. So, we use
    leverage of just 1.5:1 (not 15:1, not 30:1, and of course not 100:1 as offered
    by many brokers!) Now, we recall that a pip value of $1 is obtained when we trade
    $10,000 per trade. We multiply the original trading size (10,000) by the leverage
    (1.5) and we get only 15,000 AUD/USD.

    on drawdown – and they gave two very different values: about 30% in the former
    case and over 200% in the latter. With our acceptable level of losses of 10% and
    leverage of 1.5:1, we expect a return of 3,000 pips * $1.5 = $4,500 in 2 years.
    This equals 45% of the initial investment of $10,000.'

    performance metrics. We understand now that there are three main aspects that
    help assess the strategy performance: trade analysis, alpha-related metrics such
    as returns, and beta-related metrics such as the volatility of returns and analysis
    of drawdowns. We learned about the main factors that always have a negative impact
    on performance, such as spread, slippage, commission, and overnight swaps, and
    we saw how we can realistically account for them in our assessment.'

    alpha and beta, in a simplified form, but at least in a helpful enough way to
    improve our judgments regarding strategy. Finally, we carefully considered the
    leverage, saw its double-edged nature, and adopted the correct way of choosing
    the leverage for markets traded on margin, such as FX.

    world of capital management and risk assessment, as this entire book is only an
    introduction to the world of systematic FX trading in general. However, even the
    basic facts and techniques considered in this book are enough to start your own
    homework. Hopefully, this homework is going to be perpetual – because any successful
    trader, in the long run, is a perpetual student of the market.

    to do it, critically analyze the results – using the approach outlined in this
    chapter, and continue your studies, using my remarks *“it is unfortunately outside
    the scope of this book”* as invitations to learn more yourself. One day, you may
    find that you operate a portfolio of various strategies running in a large number
    of markets, bringing you both mental satisfaction from decent work and quite a
    significant material reward.

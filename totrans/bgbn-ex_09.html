We will begin with a basic introduction to robotics, with some definitions and explanations about robotics systems and a little bit of history about robots. Then, we will look into the robotics system structure, just like we did in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Introduction to Physical Computing Systems">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Physical Computing Systems</em></span>, regarding physical computing systems. We will take a look at the basic blocks of hardware and software involved in robotic systems, which is similar to our physical computing systems. Then, we will look into their operation, followed by differential drive robots at the end, because we will be building a differential drive robot in the next chapter.</p><p>The contents of the chapter are divided into the following sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">An introduction to robotics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The elements, structure, and operation of robotics systems</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Application areas</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Differential-drive robots</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Introduction to robotics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec60"/>Introduction to robotics</h1></div></div></div><p>Many people remember<a id="id393" class="indexterm"/> only the famous actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and relate the humanoid terminator robot from the Terminator movies when they hear the word "robot". Even though it is true that the word robot relates to similar types of robots, people forget that the exact meaning of robots is not just that. Actually, that is just one type of robot: the humanoid type robots or—as people call them these days—androids are robots that resemble humans. We are still at the beginning stages of android robot development—there is a long way to go in that field of research if we are to reach results similar to science fiction movie robots.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_01.jpg" alt="Introduction to robotics"/><div class="caption"><p>Sci-Fi humanoid robot versus the most advanced actual robot currently available</p></div></div><p>What is called a<a id="id394" class="indexterm"/> robot has many different definitions. The definitions depend on which technology is being used in the robotic system and what application the robotic system performs. Relating to the known definition of the physical computing system, we can define a robotic system as any physical computing system that is composed of electromechanical actuators that can either autonomously or semi-autonomously perform actions guided by a computer program running on its electronic hardware circuit.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_02.jpg" alt="Introduction to robotics"/><div class="caption"><p>A pick-and-place food robot and a hospital telepresence robot</p></div></div><p>In a much basic way, we can say that robots are machines that are designed in such a way that they are capable of carrying out one specific task or multiple tasks with speed and accuracy. You can easily buy many different types of robotic systems available in the market for different applications, starting from vacuum cleaner robots that clean your floors to robots that serve coffee and tea to you in a coffee shop and look exactly like a human being. We will discuss some of the widespread and current application areas of robots later in this chapter.</p><p>Even though robots have existed for a long time, they always used to be inside research labs and were costly for people to get until the industrial revolution. During the industrial revolution, manufacturers and industries wanted many industrial machines to speed up production and produce more items in less time without defects. Industrial machines started emerging, which were built from the structure of robotic systems such as robotic arms that were built using actuators and were capable of lifting heavy weights in the industries. In the early stages, almost all robotic systems were operated by humans using a remote control to<a id="id395" class="indexterm"/> ensure security and flexibility. But as software started becoming cheaper and more reliable, robotic systems with semiautonomous functions started to evolve, such as conveyer belts with robotic actuators that picked items from the conveyer and packed them automatically, and similarly, many other applications started to emerge in the industries. Nowadays, there are companies that manufacture food and beverages that are entirely prepared and packed by robots, with very little human intervention.</p><p>As a result of research and development to build smart and intelligent industrial robotic systems, many sensors and actuator mechanisms were developed to replace human intervention during production in industries, which led to the evolution of a wide variety of sensors that are not being developed further to build humanoid robots. Even though they showed such robots in movies more than a decade back, we still have many years to go until we build robots that can replace human beings.</p><p>Before we look into the wide application areas of robotic systems, let's look into the basic elements and structure of robotic systems in order to understand their functioning.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Elements, structure and operation of robotic systems"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec61"/>Elements, structure and operation of robotic systems</h1></div></div></div><p>In this section, you will learn<a id="id396" class="indexterm"/> what the robotic systems are composed of, followed by their operation. Like we defined in the previous section, robotic systems are very similar to physical computing systems, just that in some physical computing systems, you <a id="id397" class="indexterm"/>might not have actuators that perform tasks that reduce human effort, unlike robotic systems. So, the elements of the systems as well as their operation<a id="id398" class="indexterm"/> are almost similar. In some cases, the term "physical computing systems" can be synonymous with robotic systems as well.</p><p>Just like any physical computing system, any robotic system will also have input sensors and output actuators connected to a CPU with input/output ports. The actuators are driven based on the computer program running on the CPU, which depends on the inputs from the sensors present in the robotic system.</p><p>To make it easy for<a id="id399" class="indexterm"/> you to understand as well as to give you a brief idea about the robot we will be building in the next chapter, let's take a look at the block diagram of a two-wheeled robot that will randomly move without hitting any surface:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_03.jpg" alt="Elements, structure and operation of robotic systems"/></div><p>If you look at the block diagram, it consists of a sensor, that is, an <a id="id400" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ultra Sonic Sensor</strong></span> that detects the distance of any obstacle in front of it from its position, and the sensor is connected to the input port of the CPU. Similarly, we have a <span class="strong"><strong>Motor Controller IC</strong></span>, or the <a id="id401" class="indexterm"/>motor driver IC, which will help us drive heavy-duty motors with high voltages for them to run by taking digital inputs <a id="id402" class="indexterm"/>of low voltages that we get from the microcontroller. So, this motor driver IC is connected to the output port of the CPU. The motors are connected to the motor driver IC. Based on the inputs given to the motor driver IC, the motor is driven in a particular <a id="id403" class="indexterm"/>direction. We will look into this IC in detail in the next chapter. And, at last, the most important thing is that everything be powered using an external power supply, which is usually a DC source, but it can be AC sometimes, depending on the application. In our case, for the project in the next chapter, it will be DC. If you see the following block diagram of the physical computing system from <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Introduction to Physical Computing Systems">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introduction to Physical Computing Systems</em></span>, you can understand that it is somewhat similar:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_04.jpg" alt="Elements, structure and operation of robotic systems"/></div><p>So, when you compare the structure with the structure of the robotic system we use for demonstrative purposes, it comprises a sensor that provides input to the CPU, and there is a driver IC that works<a id="id404" class="indexterm"/> depending on the output from the CPU to drive the motors. And in the CPU, we have software running that will randomly make the robot move without hitting any obstacle.</p><p>Depending on the software, the robot can operate in any way. For example, for a random obstacle-avoidance and autonomous robot that moves randomly, it moves the robot in the forward direction based on the outputs from the output pins of the microcontroller, and at the same time, the software keeps reading the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor. Whenever an obstacle is detected at a set distance from the sensor, it is programmed to consider it as an obstacle. So, the program stops the motors from running by changing the output signal on the output pins of the controllers and then turns the robot either left or right. This can be random, or<a id="id405" class="indexterm"/> we can instruct it in our code to go only left or right every time an obstacle is detected. So, the robot starts to turn in a particular direction until there is free <a id="id406" class="indexterm"/>space for it to move and then stops again and starts moving straight. In this way, the program loop will be running and the robot will be moving randomly without hitting anything. This can sound dumb as it doesn't do any specific work nor performs any complex task. But when you add some more sensors to the system, such as a compass to read the angles at which it is starting to turn and some wheel encoders added to measure the distance travelled by the robot, and then write a program in such a way that it doesn't repeat travelling in the same area, it can become an awesome robot if you mount a vacuum cleaner system to it. One such robot is a commercially available vacuum cleaner robot.</p><p>So, any machine turns into a robot depending on how smart it works and solves a real-time problem and performs the action. Let's look into such examples, where robots with simple hardware but great software are being used in different applications, in the next section. Then, in the end, we will come back and look at differential-drive robots a little deeper to understand how actually these motors turn in different directions based on the motor directions using just two wheels with motors.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Application areas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec62"/>Application areas</h1></div></div></div><p>When we discuss the application areas of robotics, we can see that the existence of robots is widespread. The most <a id="id407" class="indexterm"/>commonly categorized robotic systems based on application areas are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Industrial robots</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Household or domestic robots</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Medical robots</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mobile robots</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Social and humanoid robots</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Industrial robotics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec17"/>Industrial robotics</h2></div></div></div><p>As mentioned before, even though we<a id="id408" class="indexterm"/> have been building robots for a long time, their widespread usage came about only through industrial robots in manufacturing to increase productivity. These are machines that perform specific tasks in industries at high speed.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_05.jpg" alt="Industrial robotics"/></div><p>In the preceding picture, you can see robotic arms manufacturing cars in a car manufacturing industry. The programming of these arms is done in such a way that all the robotic arms and conveyers that are moving the cars work in a synchronous way and each of these robot arms perform a specific task, such as fitting a nut or welding two metal sheets.</p></div><div class="section" title="Domestic robots"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec18"/>Domestic robots</h2></div></div></div><p>Robots that help humans<a id="id409" class="indexterm"/> with household chores are called domestic robots.

Just like I mentioned before, most robots are remotely operated. In many situations, with these robots, surgeons perform surgeries while in a different location from where the patients are.</p><p>If you look at the image on the right, it shows a man with an exoskeleton hand, and he has no thumb.

</p></div></div><p>Take a look at the preceding images. The image on the left shows warehouse-management mobile robots that carry racks with items on them in a warehouse, depending on requests from<a id="id415" class="indexterm"/> the control unit. These robots are mobile and work much faster than humans going in search of a particular item and bringing it to the packing station or any place in the warehouse. These mobile robots have changed warehouse management drastically recently. Next, if you look at the image on the right side, it shows one of the latest mobile robots, which carries pizzas to its customers' home addresses and delivers them. These robots avoid obstacles and don't hit humans; they plan their path and keep moving. Vacuum-cleaner robots also come under mobile robots, but then again, they can be categorized as domestic robots, depending on their applications. So, most of these application areas are interlinked.</p><p>Mobile robots include even robots used in military applications, space exploration, under water robots, and so on.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_09.jpg" alt="Mobile robots"/></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"/>Note</h3><p>

</p></div></div><p>If you look at the<a id="id416" class="indexterm"/> preceding images, you can see three different robots. The leftmost one is a military robot equipped with a weapon that can be triggered from a remote location. In the middle, we have the Mars rover, a robot that was sent to Mars to explore the planet's surface. It has a communication link with a station on Earth through satellites. And at last, to the far right, we have a robot that is used in underwater <a id="id417" class="indexterm"/>exploration, called the OpenROV. Now, an interesting fact about this robot is that it has been built with BeagleBone Black as the master controller in it. This is a prime example of how a hobby project using BeagleBone Black can be turned into a commercial product. We will also be building something similar in the next chapter. But instead of going underwater, it will explore what is around on the ground with a camera and show a live video feed to us.</p><p>From these examples, you can understand that even though they perform so many applications, the basic structure of these robots remains the same, and it's the add-on features that we give them using different sensors, actuators, communication links, and the software programs we write that make all the difference and give so many different names to the robots based on their applications.</p></div><div class="section" title="Social and humanoid robots"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec21"/>Social and humanoid robots</h2></div></div></div><p>Robots that resemble<a id="id418" class="indexterm"/> humans in look as well as interaction are called humanoid robots.

</p></div></div><p>If you look at the picture <a id="id419" class="indexterm"/>on the left-hand side, you can see a robot that looks like a human being with hands, legs, ears, and a face on a display. The<a id="id420" class="indexterm"/> robot is a great work of research and development in robotics, and it tries to resemble the human body's structure, with fingers on the hands to grab something and hold it and feet to walk from place to place. It also understands speech and responds to humans.</p><p>If you look at the image on the right, it shows one of the latest social robot that interacts with people based on voice processing. But this doesn't look like a human. Social robots are primarily built to work as personal assistants to humans. They're also meant for entertainment; for instance, the robot can tell you stories, play a song for you, and much more. I guess now you can understand why the "social" moniker is being given to such robots.</p><p>The categories and application areas of robots are endless. One book is not enough to explain all of it. You can do your own research to learn more. With that, we will end this topic and move on to differential-drive robots, which are one form of mobile robots, as this control mechanism is going to help us build our own mobile robot in the next chapter.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Differential-drive robots"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec63"/>Differential-drive robots</h1></div></div></div><p>Differential-drive is<a id="id421" class="indexterm"/> a control mechanism that is being used in most situations requiring control of navigating robots, especially for indoor applications. For beginners as well, this is considered the best control mechanism to get started with robots. Most indoor navigating robots used in industries and homes use this very mechanism.</p><p>The concept of this mechanism<a id="id422" class="indexterm"/> is to use two separately driven motors coupled with the wheels of the robot, separated by a distance and placed on a fixed common horizontal axis. The base also includes one or multiple caster wheels or roller-ball wheels attached to it to maintain equilibrium.</p><p>Here is how it looks:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_11.jpg" alt="Differential-drive robots"/></div><p>In the diagram, you can see two different configurations of differential-drive robots. The one on the left has two casters, while the other has just one. These two are one of the most commonly used differential-drive system configurations used. Both of them have different kinematics during navigation. If you want to look into it, you can read more on the Internet. Right now, to get started, you can chose one of these chassis—whichever you get in your market. The operation depends on controlling two motors using a motor driver IC and the outputs from the MCU.</p><p>When we look at the operation of these robots for navigation, it looks like these diagrams:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Moving forward:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_12.jpg" alt="Differential-drive robots"/></div><p>When the right-hand motor rotates clockwise and the left-hand one runs anticlockwise, the robot will move forward.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Moving<a id="id423" class="indexterm"/> backwards:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_13.jpg" alt="Differential-drive robots"/></div><p>When the right-hand motor rotates anticlockwise and the left-hand one motor runs clockwise, exactly opposite to the directions during forward motion, the robot will move backwards.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Turing left:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_14.jpg" alt="Differential-drive robots"/></div><p>When<a id="id424" class="indexterm"/> the left-hand motor is stopped and the right-hand motor runs clockwise, the robot turns left.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Turning right:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_15.jpg" alt="Differential-drive robots"/></div><p>When the left-hand motor runs anticlockwise and the right-hand motor is stopped, the robot turns right.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Spinning:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4602_09_16.jpg" alt="Differential-drive robots"/></div><p>When both <a id="id425" class="indexterm"/>motors run in the anticlockwise direction, the robot spins clockwise on its own axis when looked at from above. Similarly, when the motor directions are reversed, it will spin anticlockwise.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Stop:<p>I believe we don't need a picture to explain this action—if neither motor is running, the robot stops.</p></li></ul></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec64"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>With that, we are at the end of this chapter, where we had a basic introduction to robotics, including some examples relating science fiction and reality, followed by a brief explanation of how robotic systems are structured and how they work. We also looked at some examples and discussed application areas. In the end, we also saw how differential-drive robots work and how they can be operated. We will be building our own live-video streaming differential-drive robot in the next chapter.</p></div></body></html>

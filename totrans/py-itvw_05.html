<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll</strong></span>: Why <a id="id120" class="indexterm"/>did you become a programmer, Doug?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Doug Hellmann</strong></span>: I got interested in computers when I was pretty young, through some summer programs that my local school system ran at the time. I enjoyed programming, and learning about how computers work, so I decided to pursue a CS degree in college. The work we did in school really reinforced for me that programming was something I could enjoy doing for a living.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Why Python? What makes <a id="id121" class="indexterm"/>Python special to you?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: I was first introduced to Python around 1997, when I was working in a tools and build management group for a GIS software company called ERDAS.</p><p>We needed to build some tools to help manage the builds on several UNIX platforms, as well as Windows NT and 95. We had a lot of Makefiles and shell scripts, but they weren't especially portable. The more I used Python, the more I was able to find new ways to use it.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Doug Hellmann: 'The more I used Python, the more I was able to find new ways to use it.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>After first learning Python, I remember being simultaneously happy that I had found a new tool language that was so easy to use, and sad that the company I was working with didn't let us use it for 'real work' at the time!</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Doug, you went on to become the technical editor for Python Magazine, which I used to really enjoy. I've always wondered how <a id="id122" class="indexterm"/>Python Magazine<a id="id123" class="indexterm"/> got started...and why did it then stop?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: Python Magazine began with Brian Jones as the first editor-in-chief.</p><p>Brian pitched the idea to MTA, the publishers. They had been focused on the PHP community, but agreed that it seemed like the Python community could also support a magazine.</p><p>Was that the right call? Well, we did okay for a while, but I think the timing was poor for a new paid print publication to launch. An e-zine might work better, today, but it's a tough industry.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What made you also start the tremendously successful 'Python Module of the Week' series, Doug? What's driven you to carry on writing PyMOTW<a id="id124" class="indexterm"/> for more than ten years now?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: Yes, it has been over ten years. I started the PyMOTW blog series (<a class="ulink" href="https://pymotw.com">https://pymotw.com</a>) in 2007 as a <a id="id125" class="indexterm"/>way to push myself to write on a regular basis. I decided a theme would make it easier to find topics to write about, and writing once a week seemed like a good goal.</p><p>The interest from the rest of the community grew slowly over time, but feedback was mostly positive. I'm sure I would have stopped early on if it wasn't for all of the feedback and support that everyone has given me.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How did your <a id="id126" class="indexterm"/>book come about, Doug?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: At a PyCon a couple of years into the project, Mark Ramm<a id="id127" class="indexterm"/> introduced me to<a id="id128" class="indexterm"/> Debra Williams Cauley, an editor from Pearson. I pitched the idea of cleaning up the blog posts and turning the series into a book. Debra helped me to figure out how to structure it to make it work in that format. The whole team at Pearson has been great to work with.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Doug Hellmann: 'The Python 3 Standard Library contains hundreds of modules for interacting with the operating system, interpreter, and internet.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Your book is incredibly helpful to Python developers. So what do you think new Python programmers should do once they've learned the basics?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: I encourage folks to set a goal by picking a problem that they want to solve for themselves. That gives them a framework for learning things like how to break down a project into pieces that can be implemented one at a time, which in turn helps them to focus on learning one skill at a time.</p><p>At PyOhio 2015<a id="id129" class="indexterm"/>, I talked about one of my own projects as an example of this. Of course, not all projects need<a id="id130" class="indexterm"/> to be as complex as the Smiley example:</p><p>

</p><p>Every programmer builds little throw-away tool scripts as well as more complicated reusable projects, and all of them are an opportunity to learn something new.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Doug Hellmann: 'Every programmer builds little throw-away tool scripts as well as more complicated reusable projects, and all of them are an opportunity to learn something new.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Another good way to learn is to attend a local meetup, and talk to other programmers. The Atlanta Python meetup group<a id="id131" class="indexterm"/> tries to maintain a good mix of introductory and more advanced talks to help encourage folks with a range of skills to attend our meetings. Sometimes the most informative part of the evening is the Q&amp;A after a talk, or the discussions during breaks, when you have the chance to ask for more detail or clarification.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What<a id="id132" class="indexterm"/> active projects are you involved in today Doug?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: For the past five years I've been working on various aspects of OpenStack. Aside from the cloud management software itself, we've produced some interesting tools like the pbr library, to help with packaging.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So how did you get started<a id="id133" class="indexterm"/> as an OpenStack developer?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: I started working on OpenStack at DreamHost. I had known Jonathan LaCour, the VP of engineering, through the Atlanta Python meetup for a few years and the timing worked out well when he needed someone, and I was interested in changing jobs. We had a small team in the <a id="id134" class="indexterm"/>Atlanta area, and we all helped each other to bootstrap into the OpenStack community.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Doug Hellmann: 'I had known Jonathan LaCour, VP of Engineering, through the Atlanta Python meetup for a few years...'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So the power of<a id="id135" class="indexterm"/> meetups was really in action there! What are your goals for OpenStack at the moment?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: I have a very flexible mandate from Red Hat to work on what's needed to keep the OpenStack community healthy.</p><p>I serve on the Technical Committee, which is our elected governing body. We try to guide the project, and help to bring the large contributor base to some level of consensus when we have major decisions to make.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Doug Hellmann: 'I have a very flexible mandate from Red Hat to work on what's needed to keep the OpenStack community healthy.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I have also served as team lead for the Oslo team, which manages the set of common libraries shared between the various OpenStack services. We try to build the libraries to be as reusable as possible, but sometimes we need to share code within OpenStack that isn't going to be that useful to anyone else.</p><p>I've also worked on the release tools, extending the pipeline to make the release process scale from a highly manual process for five projects, to a highly automated process supporting around 350 different deliverables. I've built some tools like <code class="literal">reno</code>, our release note management program, and I jump in on other initiatives where help is needed.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So, regarding some of the tools that you've created, what was your inspiration for <a id="id136" class="indexterm"/>creating <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper</code>?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: While I was working as a technical<a id="id137" class="indexterm"/> editor and later editor-in-chief for Python Magazine, I ended up needing to manage a lot of different <code class="literal">virtualenv</code>'s. Each author provided instructions for installing the tools they used for their articles, and I wanted to be able to test out the code.</p><p>I started writing a few aliases to manage environments easily, and the project grew organically from there. My workflow has changed significantly since I've been so focused on OpenStack, so I haven't been contributing to <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper</code> as much as I used to. I'm happy to have Jason Myers taking over as the lead maintainer on the project these days.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So while you were<a id="id138" class="indexterm"/> creating <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper</code>, can you tell us what you learned?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: Sure, I can actually <a id="id139" class="indexterm"/>think of three things that I learned while I was creating <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper</code>.</p><p>First of all I learned how contributions come from surprising directions. Doug Latornell provided the original patches to support ksh. I had no idea that anyone would be interested in supporting ksh, so I hadn't thought beyond Bash. I think he was using <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper</code> on an AIX system at that point, though, and his patches were easy to integrate and support once they merged.</p><p>The second thing I learned was that it's important to keep it fun. For instance, I created the following site just because of a Tweet from Alex Gaynor:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper.alex">https://bitbucket.org/dhellmann/virtualenvwrapper.alex</a></p><p>"The <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper.alex</code> installs aliases for typos related to common <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper</code> commands. Really. It exists because Alex Gaynor asked nicely."</p><p>The third learning point that I have to offer is that you can't please everyone all of the time. So <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper</code> supports plugins to enable folks to share their extensions, but there is now an entire category of similar tools like <code class="literal">pyenv</code>, <code class="literal">vex</code>, and others where the operating model is very different. That's great! As I said, my own workflow has changed enough that I don't rely on <code class="literal">virtualenv wrapper</code> so much anymore, either.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So if you could start <code class="literal">virtualenvwrapper</code> from scratch, what would you do differently?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: I would now build it on Python 3's <code class="literal">venv</code> instead of <code class="literal">virtualenv</code> and today I would design it as a single main command that took subcommands.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What are you most excited about in <a id="id140" class="indexterm"/>Python today?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: I have always been most excited about the vibrant community. As more people discover Python, or apply it in new areas, that community keeps expanding.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll: What are your thoughts on the long life of Python 2.7?</strong></span>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: The long <a id="id141" class="indexterm"/>lifetime for Python 2.7 recognizes the reality that rewriting functional software based on backwards-incompatible upstream changes isn't a high priority for most companies.</p><p>I encourage people to use the latest version of Python 3 that is available on their deployment platform for all new projects. I also advise them to carefully reconsider porting their remaining legacy applications now that most actively maintained libraries support Python 3.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What changes would you<a id="id142" class="indexterm"/> like to see in future Python releases?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Hellmann</strong></span>: I am most interested in the work related to packaging right now. Those changes will not go into Python itself, but into tools like <code class="literal">setuptools</code>, <code class="literal">twine</code>, <code class="literal">wheel</code>, <code class="literal">pip</code>, and <code class="literal">warehouse</code>. Simplifying the <a id="id143" class="indexterm"/>process of packaging and distributing Python packages will help all of our users.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Thank you, Doug Hellmann.</p></div></body></html>

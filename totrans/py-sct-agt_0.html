When an agent's missions involve gathering data, high-powered data processing is required. This book will provide you with the kinds of information processing tools that will help you gather, analyze, and communicate the data that the HQ demands.</p><p>Python allows agents to write simple scripts to gather data, perform sophisticated calculations, and produce useful results. Agents can also use Python to extract data from local files, HTTP web servers, and FTP file servers.</p><p>Python has numerous add-on packages. This book will explore just two: Pillow allows for sophisticated image conversion and manipulation, and BeautifulSoup allows an agent to extract data from HTML web pages. Agents with specific needs might have to explore the Python Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Numeric Python (NumPy), or even Scientific Python (SciPy).</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Our Espionage Toolkit">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Our Espionage Toolkit</em>, exposes the basics of installing and using Python. We'll write scripts to help agents work with foreign currency conversions and learn how an agent can recover a lost password from a ZIP archive.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Acquiring Intelligence Data">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Acquiring Intelligence Data</em>, shows how we can use Python to extract information from various kinds of file servers. Agents will learn how to work with different Internet protocols and use Representational State Transfer (REST) to interact with web services. This will include techniques to work with cyptocurrencies, such as bitcoins.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Encoding Secret Messages with Steganography">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Encoding Secret Messages with Steganography</em>, shows how we can add the Pillow toolset to work with images. An agent with Pillow can create thumbnails and convert, crop, and enhance images. We'll also explore some steganography algorithms to bury our messages in an image file.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Drops, Hideouts, Meetups, and Lairs">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Drops, Hideouts, Meetups, and Lairs</em>, provides a closer look at geocoding and geolocation. This includes the use of web services to convert an address into a latitude and longitude. We'll also learn how to convert a latitude and longitude back into an address. We'll take a look at the haversine formula to get the correct distance between locations. We'll also look at some of the ways in which geographic locations can be represented for tidy storage and communication.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. A Spymaster's More Sensitive Analyses">Chapter 5</a>, <em>A Spymaster's More Sensitive Analyses</em>, shows how we can use Python for a basic data analysis. A good agent doesn't just spout facts and figures; a good agent does enough analysis to confirm that the data is realistic. Being able to examine the correlation between datasets is what creates a valuable intelligence asset.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>A secret agent needs a computer that they have administrative privileges over. We'll be installing additional software. Without the administrative password, they may have trouble installing Python 3, Pillow, or BeautifulSoup.</p><p>For agents using Windows, the packages we're looking at adding come prebuilt.</p><p>For agents using Linux, the developer tools are required. Linux has a complete suite of developer tools that are common. The Gnu C Compiler (GCC) is the backbone of these tools.</p><p>For agents using Mac OS X, the developer tool, Xcode (<a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/</a>), is required. We'll also need to install a tool called homebrew (<a class="ulink" href="http://brew.sh">http://brew.sh</a>) to help us add the Linux packages to Mac OS X.</p><p>Python 3 is available from the Python download page at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.python.org/download">https://www.python.org/download</a>.</p><p>We'll download and install several things besides Python 3.3:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The setuptools package, which includes <code class="literal">easy_install-3.3</code>, will help us add packages. It can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools</a>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The PIP package will also help us install additional packages. Some experienced field agents prefer PIP over setuptools. It can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/1.5.6">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/1.5.6</a>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The Pillow package will allow us to work with image files. It can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.4.0">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.4.0</a>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The BeautifulSoup Version 4 package will allow us to work with HTML web pages. It can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4/4.3.2">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4/4.3.2</a>.</li></ul></div><p>From this, we'll see how extensible Python is. Almost anything an agent might need may already be written and available through the Python Package Index (PyPi), which can be downloaded from <a class="ulink" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">https://pypi.python.org/pypi</a>.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for secret agents who don't know much Python, but are comfortable installing new software and are ready to do some clever programming in Python. An agent who has never done any programming before might find some of this a bit advanced; a beginner's tutorial that covers the basics of Python may be helpful.</p><p>We'll expect that an agent using this book is comfortable with simple math. This involves the multiplication and division of currency conversions. It also includes polynomials, simple trigonometry, and a few statistical formulae.</p><p>We also expect the secret agents using this book to be doing their own investigations. The book's examples are designed to get the agent started down the road with developing interesting, useful applications. Each agent will have to explore further afield on their own.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, package names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The <code class="literal">size_list</code> variable is a sequence of eight-tuples built from the bytes of the encoded size."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">message_bytes= message.encode("UTF-8")
bits_list = list(to_bits(c) for c in message_bytes )
len_h, len_l = divmod( len(message_bytes), 256 )
size_list = [to_bits(len_h), to_bits(len_l)]
bit_sequence( size_list+bits_list )</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">w, h = ship.size
for p,m in enumerate( bit_sequence(size_list+bits_list) ):
    y, x = divmod( p, w )
    r, g, b = ship.getpixel( (x,y) )
    <strong>r_new = (r &amp; 0xfe) | m</strong>
    print( (r, g, b), m, (r_new, g, b) )
    ship.putpixel( (x,y), (r_new, g, b)  )</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>$ python3.3 -m doctest ourfile.py</strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "There is an <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> panel that defines these file associations."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>

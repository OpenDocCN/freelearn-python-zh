</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll</strong></span>: Could <a id="id563" class="indexterm"/>you tell me a little about your background?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jake Vanderplas</strong></span>: I studied physics as an undergraduate and spent a few years after college working in the outdoors as an environmental educator and a mountaineering guide.</p><p>After a few summers sleeping under the stars each night in California's Sierra Nevada, I fell in love with astronomy and decided to take advantage of my physics background to head to graduate school and learn more.</p><p>Up until my first year of graduate school, I'd only done a bit of coding. I had messed around with HyperCard in middle school and taken a C++ class in high school. I had also learned some basic Mathematica in college.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How did you get <a id="id564" class="indexterm"/>started using the Python programming language?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: Astronomy<a id="id565" class="indexterm"/> is very computationally-driven these days and so when I started graduate school, I needed to relearn how to code.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jake Vanderplas: 'Astronomy is very computationally-driven these days...'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Most of my department was using IDL in those days, but I was lucky enough to do a quarter-long research project with a professor who recommended Python. He told me that Python was the future and in retrospect he was entirely correct!</p><p>I taught myself Python over winter break by writing a Sudoku puzzle solver and then turning that into a Sudoku puzzle generator. Much later on, I arrived at PyCon 2017 and explained why Python is liked and used by so many scientists.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What do you like about Python?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: I like Python <a id="id566" class="indexterm"/>first of all because it is open, which is a huge advantage over some other tools favored by academics (Mathematica, IDL and MATLAB come to mind).</p><p>When I first started using Python, I found the syntax and semantics to be incredibly clean and intuitive, which made coding fun for me in a way that it never was when I was first learning C++.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jake Vanderplas: 'I found Python's syntax and semantics to be incredibly clean and intuitive.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Also, the scientific Python ecosystem, even though it was fairly nascent when I started, is a huge boon. No matter what you want to do with Python in science, it's likely that someone has created a package for it.</p><p>Python's interoperability with so many other languages means that it can act like the glue between the various tools that scientists need to use together. Then the 'batteries included' aspect of Python means that there's a built-in library for nearly everything and a third-party library for everything else.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jake Vanderplas: 'Python…can act like the glue between the various tools that scientists need to use together.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Python's simple and dynamic nature makes it perfect for day-to-day scientific data exploration, where speed of development is primary and speed of execution is often secondary.</p><p>Last but not least, Python's open<a id="id567" class="indexterm"/> ethos does fit well with science and we're seeing an increasing number of scientists hosting their research code on GitHub and similar services, to aid in reproducibility.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How is Python's open ethos<a id="id568" class="indexterm"/> helping the scientific community?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: Python's open ethos is a great match for how science should be done. I made the point in my keynote at PyCon 2017 that over the past five to ten years, scientists have really absorbed many of the best-practice lessons from the open source community.</p><p>Code sharing, version control, unit testing, and code documentation are essential for making sure that modern science is reproducible. The people doing the best computational work in the scientific community have adapted many of these practices from the open source (and particularly Python open source) community.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What is <a id="id569" class="indexterm"/>Python missing that would be great for scientists?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: The biggest challenge with Python for scientists is that the scaling of computation requires writing code in a language other than Python.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jake Vanderplas: 'The biggest challenge with Python for scientists is that the scaling of computation requires writing code in a language other than Python.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Tools like Cython and Numba address part of this problem by letting you convert Python or Python-like code to fast compiled code, but there is a cognitive overhead involved in deciding when and where to switch to these additional tools. PyPy is promising, but the problem is that it doesn't support CPython's C-API, which the bulk of the scientific ecosystem requires.</p><p>This is why some people in the community are attracted to Julia. It's a language built for scientific computation, with fast LLVM-based execution built-in from the ground up. That said, Julia feels a bit clunky to me in some areas and I wish we could have a happy medium: Python's syntax with Julia's performance.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How can the Python community help the scientific community to learn Python? What projects are you currently using Python in?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: I do all of my <a id="id570" class="indexterm"/>daily work in Python. Currently I'm<a id="id571" class="indexterm"/> involved in several research projects at the University of Washington (UW). I'm mentoring students working on astronomy and on transportation-focused data science.</p><p>I'm helping to develop the Altair library, which is a Python interface to the Vega-Lite grammar of visualization. I think it will <a id="id572" class="indexterm"/>be a good fit <a id="id573" class="indexterm"/>for one of the current holes in the Python scientific space, which is exploratory data analysis.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jake Vanderplas: 'I generally push Python...and these days, I rarely have to push very hard!'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Part of my job at UW is essentially consulting with researchers around the university to help with computational or statistical aspects of their research. I generally push Python in most of those cases and these days, I rarely have to push very hard!</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Do most astronomists do a lot of computer programming?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: Computing is absolutely essential in modern astronomy! The field has, for the most part, moved beyond the romantic days of traveling to remote peaks to peer through telescopes. Even when observing on-site, observations are recorded by CCDs attached to the telescopes.</p><p>Beyond that, it's generally true that all of the <span class="emphasis"><em>easy</em></span> observations have already been made. To really push forward our understanding of the universe requires novel studies. That novelty might mean observing very faint objects (in which case detailed noise models are a necessity), or observing many objects to learn about their statistical properties (in which a scalable computing environment is essential).</p><p>At either end of that spectrum, you better know how to write code to ingest telescope images, model the interesting feature and spit out useful results.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How common is it for scientists to need to write code?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: Like in astronomy, scientists in most fields are finding coding to be essential.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jake Vanderplas: 'Scientists in most fields are finding coding to be essential.' </strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>We astronomers have been a bit ahead of the curve when it comes to data volumes, but as sensors, cameras, satellites and other devices become cheaper and more abundant, the <span class="emphasis"><em>data deluge</em></span> is starting to be a feature in most other domains as well.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Which <a id="id574" class="indexterm"/>scientific fields use programming the most?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: It's very hard to say, but immense volumes of data are being produced in astronomy.</p><p>So in radio astronomy, for example, there are projects that are producing data at rates of about 5GB/s. In physics, the LHC produces data at a rate of about 25GB/s. Then in biostatistics, gene sequencing data for an individual is typically ~100s of GB. All of these fields are using sophisticated algorithms to extract meaning from that data.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: On the other side of the coin, are you aware of any scientific fields where Python is weak in? If so, what are they?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Vanderplas</strong></span>: Some fields have long histories of ingrained toolchains. For example, MATLAB could probably be described as standard in many engineering and applied math departments.</p><p>Ten years ago, a language called IDL dominated most of astronomy research, but that has changed and now Python is the dominant language mentioned in refereed publications.</p><p>The way this changed in astronomy was two-fold. You had some visionaries in positions of influence that pushed for <a id="id575" class="indexterm"/>Python early on (for example, Perry Greenfield at the Space Telescope Science Institute). Then there was a real groundswell coming from graduate students and postdocs, who worked hard to train each other (examples are software carpentry workshops and the SciCoder program).</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Jake Vanderplas: 'The momentum of Python sort of took over.' </strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>There has also been a community-wide push to standardize the astronomy Python tool stack. The result is the (phenomenal) Astropy project. Beyond that, the momentum of Python sort of took over.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Thank you, Jake Vanderplas.</p></div></body></html>

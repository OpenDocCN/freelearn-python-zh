    Lock** (**GIL**). In this chapter, we will cover a definition and the purposes
    of the GIL and how it affects concurrent Python applications. The problems that
    the GIL poses for Python concurrent systems and the controversy around its implementation
    will also be discussed. Finally, we will mention some thoughts on how Python programmers
    and developers should think about, and interact with, the GIL.

- en: Before we jump into the specifics of the GIL and its effects, let's consider
    the problems that Python core developers encountered during the early days of
    Python that gave rise to a need for the GIL. Specifically, there is a significant
    difference between Python programming and programming in other popular languages,
    in terms of managing objects in the memory space.
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, in the programming language C++, a variable is actually a location
    in the memory space where a value will be written. This setup leads to the fact
    that, when a non-pointer variable is assigned with a specific value, the programming
    language will effectively copy that specific value to the memory location (that
    is, the **variable**). Additionally, when a variable is assigned with another
    variable (that is not a pointer), the memory location of the latter will be copied
    to that of the former; no further connection between these two variables will
    be maintained after the assignment.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, Python considers a variable as simply a name, while the actual
    values of its variables are isolated in another region in the memory space. When
    a value is assigned to a variable, the variable is effectively given a reference
    to the location in the memory space of the value (even though the term *referencing*
    is not used in the same sense as C++ referencing). Memory management in Python
    is, therefore, fundamentally different from the model of putting a value into
    a memory space that we see in C++.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that when an assignment instruction is executed, Python simply interacts
    with references and switches them around—not the actual values themselves. Also,
    for this reason, multiple variables can be referenced by the same value, and the
    changes made by one variable will be reflected throughout all of the other associated
    variables.

    of one element: the integer `7`). We mentioned that values in Python are stored
    independently of variables, and value management in Python simply references variables

    object and returns the counter of all references that the value associated with
    that object has. Here, we are calling `sys.getrefcount()` three times: on the

    *Race Conditions*, you should know that in a Python concurrent program, this reference
    count is a shared resource that needs protection from race conditions. In other
    words, this reference count is a critical section that, if handled carelessly,
    will result in an incorrect interpretation of how many variables are referencing
    a particular value. This will cause memory leaks that will make Python programs
    significantly inefficient and may even release a memory that is actually being
    referenced by some variables, losing that value forever.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you learned in the previous chapter, a solution to making sure that race
    conditions will not occur with regard to a particular shared resource is to place
    a lock on that resource, effectively allowing one thread, at the most, to access
    the resource at any given time within a concurrent program. We also discussed
    that if enough locks are placed in a concurrent program, that program will become
    entirely sequential, and no additional speed will be gained by implementing concurrency.

- en: The GIL is a solution to the combination of the two preceding problems, being
    one single lock on the entire execution of Python. The GIL must first be acquired
    by any Python instruction that wants to be executed (**central processing unit**
    (**CPU**)-bound tasks), preventing a race condition from occurring for any reference
    count.

    to the problem described here were also proposed, but the GIL was the most efficient
    and simple to implement, by far. Since the GIL is a lightweight, overarching lock
    for the entire execution of Python, no other lock needs to be implemented to guarantee
    the integrity of other critical sections, keeping the performance overhead of
    Python programs at a minimum.

    CPU-bound tasks from being executed in parallel across multiple threads. To understand

    in Python sequentially and concurrently, via multithreading. Specifically, we
    have a function named `countdown()` that simulates a heavy CPU-bound task, which
    takes in a number, `n`, and decrements it until it becomes zero or negative. We
    then call `countdown()` on `50,000,000` once, as a sequential program. Finally,
    we call the function twice, each in a separate thread, on `25,000,000`, which
    is exactly half of `50,000,000`; this is the multithreading version of the program.
    We are also keeping track of the time it takes for Python to run both the sequential
    program and the multithreading program.

    almost as long as the sequential version; multithreading did not offer any considerable
    speedup for our program. This is a direct effect of having the GIL guarding CPU-bound
    tasks, as multiple threads are not allowed to run simultaneously. Sometimes, a
    multithreading program can take even longer to complete its execution than its
    sequential counterpart, since there is also the overhead of acquiring and releasing
    the GIL.

    programming in Python in general, because as long as a program contains CPU-bound
    instructions, those instructions will, in fact, be sequential in the execution
    of the program. However, instructions that are not CPU-bound happen outside the
    GIL, and thus they are not affected by the GIL (for example, **input/output**
    (**I/O**)-bound instructions).

    programs in Python, especially those with CPU-bound tasks. For this reason, many
    Python developers have come to view the GIL in a negative light, and the term
    *the infamous GIL* has started to become popular. It is not surprising, then,
    that some have even advocated the complete removal of the GIL from the Python
    language.

    users. However, the GIL is so deeply implanted in the implementation of the language,
    and the execution of most libraries and packages that are not thread-safe is so
    significantly dependent on the GIL, that the removal of the GIL will actually
    engender bugs as well as backward-incompatibility issues for your Python programs.
    A number of Python developers and researchers tried to completely omit the GIL
    from Python execution, and most existing C extensions, which depend heavily on
    the functionalities of the GIL, stopped working.

    the GIL. So, these solutions will slow down single-threaded or multithreaded I/O

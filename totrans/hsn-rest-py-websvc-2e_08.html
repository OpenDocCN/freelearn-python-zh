<p>In this chapter, we will use additional features included in Django 2.1 and Django REST Framework to improve our RESTful API. We will also write, execute, and improve unit tests and learn a few things related to deployment. We will look at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install packages with the <kbd>requirements.txt</kbd> file to work with filters, throttling, and tests</li>
<li>Understand filtering, searching, and ordering classes</li>
<li>Configure filtering, searching, and ordering for views</li>
<li>Execute HTTP requests to test filtering, searching, and ordering features</li>
<li>Filter, search, and order in the Browsable API</li>
<li>Understand throttling classes and goals</li>
<li>Configure throttling policies</li>
<li>Execute HTTP requests to test throttle policies</li>
<li>Setting up unit tests with <kbd>pytest</kbd></li>
<li>Write the first round of unit tests</li>
<li>Run unit tests with <kbd>pytest</kbd></li>
<li>Improve testing coverage</li>
<li>Run Django RESTful APIs on the cloud</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we will install many additional packages to work with filtering capabilities and to be able to easily run tests and measure their code coverage. Make sure you have activated the virtual environment we have created in the previous chapter, named <kbd>Django01</kbd>. After you activate the virtual environment, it is time to run many commands that will be the same for macOS, Linux, and Windows.</p>

<p class="mce-root">In the previous chapter, we took advantage of the pagination features available in Django REST Framework to specify how we wanted large results sets to be split into individual pages of data. However, we have always been working with the entire <kbd>queryset</kbd> as the result set; that is, we didn't apply any filter.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Django REST Framework makes it easy to customize filtering, searching, and sorting capabilities for the views we have already coded.</div>
<p>Open the <kbd>settings.py</kbd> file in the <kbd>games_service/games_service</kbd> folder. Add the following highlighted lines after the first line that declares the dictionary named <kbd>REST_FRAMEWORK</kbd> to add the new <kbd>'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS'</kbd> setting key. Don't remove the lines that will appear after the new highlighted lines. We don't show them to avoid repeating code. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_01</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/games-service/games_service/settings.py</kbd> file:</p>
<pre>REST_FRAMEWORK = { 
  <strong>  'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS': ( 
        'django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend', 
        'rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter', 
        'rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter'),</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p>The value for the <kbd>'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS'</kbd> settings key specifies a global setting with a tuple of string whose values indicate the default classes that we want to use for filter backends. We will use the following three classes:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>

<p>Module</p>

<td>
<p>Class name</p>
</td>

<p>Â </p>
<p>The <kbd>DjangoFilterBackend</kbd> class provides field-filtering capabilities through the recently installed <kbd>django-filer</kbd> package. We can specify the set of fields we want to be able to filter against or create a <kbd>django_filters.rest_framework.FilterSet</kbd> class with more customized settings and associate it with the desired view.</p>
<p>The <kbd>SearchFilter</kbd> class provides single query parameter-based searching capabilities and is based on the Django admin's search function. We can specify the set of fields we want to include for the search, and the client will be able to filter items by making queries that search on these fields with a single query. This is useful when we want to make it possible for a request to search on multiple fields with a single query.</p>
<p>The <kbd>OrderingFilter</kbd> class allows the client that composes the request to control how the results are ordered with a single query parameter. We can specify which fields may be ordered against.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Note that we can also configure the filter backends by including any of the previously enumerated classes in a tuple and assigning it to the <kbd>filter_backends</kbd> class attribute for the desired generic view. However, in this case, we will use the default configuration for all our class-based views.</div>
<p>Whenever we design a RESTful API, we have to make sure we provide the required features with a properly optimized usage of the available resources. Hence, we have to be careful to make the fields we configure available in the filtering, searching, and ordering features. The configurations we make in these features will have an impact on the queries that Django's integrated ORM will generate and execute on the database. We must definitely make sure that we have the appropriate database optimizations that take into account the queries that will be executed.</p>
<p>Stay in the <kbd>settings.py</kbd> file in the <kbd>games_service/games_service</kbd> folder. Add the following highlighted lines after the first line that declares the dictionary, named <kbd>INSTALLED_APPS</kbd>, to add <kbd>'django_filters'</kbd> as a newly installed application for the Django project.</p>

<p>Now, we can launch Django's development server to compose and send HTTP requests. Execute any of the following two commands, based on your needs to access the API in other devices or computers connected to your LAN:</p>
<pre>    <strong>python manage.py runserver</strong>
    <strong>python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</strong>
  </pre>
<p>After we run any of the previous commands, the development server will start listening at port <kbd>8000</kbd>.</p>
<p>Now, we will write a command to compose and send an HTTP <kbd>GET</kbd> request to retrieve all the ESRB ratings whose description matches <kbd>T (Teen)</kbd>. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_01</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/cmd/cmd801.txt</kbd> file:</p>
<pre>    <strong>http ":8000/esrb-ratings/?description=T+(Teen)"</strong></pre>
<p>The following is the equivalent <kbd>curl</kbd> command. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_01</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/cmd/cmd802.txt</kbd> file:</p>
<pre>    <strong>curl -iX GET "localhost:8000/esrb-ratings/?description=T+(Teen)"</strong></pre>
<p>The following lines show a sample response with the single ESRB rating whose description matches the specified description in the filter. The following lines only show the JSON body without the headers:</p>
<pre>    <strong>{</strong>
    <strong>    "count": 1,</strong>
    <strong>    "next": null,</strong>
    <strong>    "previous": null,</strong>
    <strong>    "results": [</strong>
    <strong>        {</strong>
    <strong>            "description": "T (Teen)",</strong>
    <strong>            "games": [</strong>
    <strong>                "http://localhost:8000/games/4/",</strong>
    <strong>                "http://localhost:8000/games/3/",</strong>
    <strong>                "http://localhost:8000/games/6/",</strong>

    <strong>        }</strong>
    <strong>    ]</strong>
    <strong>}</strong>
  </pre>
<p>Now, we will write a command to compose and send an HTTP <kbd>GET</kbd> request to retrieve all the games whose related ESRB rating is <kbd>1</kbd> and the value for the <kbd>played_times</kbd> field is equal to <kbd>10</kbd>. We want to sort the results by <kbd>release_date</kbd> in descending order, and therefore, we specify <kbd>-release_date</kbd> in the value for <kbd>ordering</kbd>. The hyphen (<kbd>-</kbd>) before the field name specifies the ordering feature to use descending order, instead of the default ascending order. Make sure you replace <kbd>1</kbd> with the <kbd>id</kbd> value of the ESRB rating whose description is <kbd>AO (Adults Only)</kbd>. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_01</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/cmd/cmd803.txt</kbd> file:</p>
<pre><strong>http ":8000/games/?esrb_rating=1&amp;played_times=10&amp;ordering=-release_date"</strong>
  </pre>
<p>The following is the equivalent <kbd>curl</kbd> command. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_01</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/cmd/cmd804.txt</kbd> file:</p>
<pre><strong>curl -iX GET <br/>"localhost:8000/games/?esrb_rating=1&amp;played_times=10&amp;ordering=-release_date"</strong>
  </pre>
<p>The following lines show a sample response with the single game that matches the specified criteria in the filter. The following lines only show the JSON body without the headers:</p>
<pre>    <strong>{</strong>

    <strong>        }</strong>
    <strong>    ]</strong>
    <strong>}</strong>
  </pre>
<p>In the <kbd>GameList</kbd> class, we specified <kbd>'esrb_rating'</kbd> as one of the strings in the <kbd>filterset_fields</kbd> tuple of string. Thus, we had to use the ESRB rating <kbd>id</kbd> in the filter.</p>
<p>Now, we will run a command that will compose and send an HTTP <kbd>GET</kbd> request that uses a filter on the game's name related to a registered score. The <kbd>PlayerScoreFilter</kbd> class provides us a filter to the name of the related game in <kbd>game_name</kbd>. We will combine the filter with another filter on the player's name related to a registered score. The <kbd>PlayerScoreFilter</kbd> class provides us a way to filter to the name of the related player in <kbd>player_name</kbd>. Both conditions specified in the criteria must be met, and therefore, the filters are combined with the <kbd>AND</kbd> operator. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_01</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/cmd/cmd805.txt</kbd> file:</p>
<pre><strong>http ":8000/player-<br/>scores/?player_name=Enzo+Scocco&amp;game_name=Battlefield+V"</strong>
  </pre>
<p>The following is the equivalent <kbd>curl</kbd> command. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_01</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/cmd/cmd806.txt</kbd> file:</p>
<pre><strong>curl -iX GET "localhost:8000/player-<br/>scores/?player_name=Enzo+Scocco&amp;game_name=Battlefield+V"</strong>
  </pre>
<p>The following lines show a sample response with the score that matches the specified criteria in the filters. The following lines only show the JSON body without the headers:</p>
<pre>    <strong>{</strong>
    <strong>    "count": 1,</strong>
    <strong>    "next": null,</strong>
    <strong>    "previous": null,</strong>
    <strong>    "results": [</strong>
    <strong>        {</strong>
    <strong>            "game": "Battlefield V",</strong>
    <strong>            "id": 3,</strong>
    <strong>            "player": "Enzo Scocco",</strong>
    <strong>            "score": 43200,</strong>
    <strong>            "score_date": "2019-01-01T03:02:00.776594Z",</strong>
    <strong>            "url": "http://localhost:8000/player-scores/3/"</strong>
    <strong>        }</strong>
    <strong>    ]</strong>
    <strong>}</strong>
  </pre>
<p>We will compose and send an HTTP <kbd>GET</kbd> request to retrieve all the scores that match the following criteria, sorted by <kbd>score</kbd> in descending order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <kbd>score</kbd> value is between 17,000 and 45,000</li>
<li>The <kbd>score_date</kbd> value is between 2019-01-01 and 2019-01-31</li>
</ul>
<p>The following command composes and sends the previously explained HTTP <kbd>GET</kbd> request. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_01</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/cmd/cmd807.txt</kbd> file:</p>

  </pre>
<p>The following lines show a sample response with the three games that match the specified criteria in the filters. The following lines only show the JSON body without the headers:</p>

<div class="packt_tip">In the previous requests, none of the responses had more than one page.

<p>So far, we have been using the default search and ordering query parameters: <kbd>'search'</kbd> and <kbd>'ordering'</kbd>. We just need to specify the desired names as strings in the <kbd>SEARCH_PARAM</kbd> and the <kbd>ORDERING_PARAM</kbd> settings in the <kbd>settings.py</kbd> file in the <kbd>games_service/games_service</kbd> folder.</p>

<p>We can take advantage of the Browsable API to easily test filtering, searching, and ordering features through a web browser. Open a web browser and enter <kbd>http://localhost:8000/player-scores/</kbd>. Replace <kbd>localhost</kbd> with the IP of the computer that is running the Django development server if you use another computer or device to run the browser.</p>
<p>The Browsable API will compose and send an HTTP <kbd>GET</kbd> request to <kbd>/player-scores/</kbd> and will display the results of its execution; that is, the headers and the JSON player scores list. You will notice there is a new <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> button located at the left-hand side of the <span class="packt_screen">OPTIONS</span> button.</p>
<p>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> and the Browsable API will display the <span class="packt_screen">Filters</span> dialog box, ...</p></article></section></div>

            <article>
                
<p>So far, we haven't established any limits on the usage of our API, and therefore, both authenticated and unauthenticated users can compose and send as many requests as they want to. We only took advantage of the pagination features available in Django REST Framework to specify how we wanted large result sets to be split into individual pages of data. However, any user can compose and send thousands of requests to be processed without any kind of limitation.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is not a good idea to deploy such an API encapsulated in a microservice in a cloud platform. A wrong usage of the API by any user could cause the microservice to consume a huge amount of resources, and the cloud platform bills would reflect this situation.</p>
<p>We will use the throttling capabilities available in Django REST Framework to configure the following global limitations to the usage of our API, based on whether the requests come from unauthenticated or authenticated users. We will define the following configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unauthenticated users</strong>: They will be able to run a maximum ofÂ <kbd>5</kbd> requests per hour</li>
<li><strong>Authenticated users</strong>: They will be able to run a maximum of <kbd>20</kbd> requests per hour</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we want to configure a maximum of 25 requests per hour to the ESRB ratings-related views, no matter whether the user is authenticated or not.</p>
<p>Django REST Framework provides three throttling classes (as listed in the following table), in the <kbd>rest_framework.throttling</kbd> module. All of them are subclasses of the <kbd>SimpleRateThrottle</kbd> superclass, which is a subclass of the <kbd>BaseThrottle</kbd> superclass. The classes allow us to set the maximum number of requests per period that will be computed based on different mechanisms to determine the previous request information to specify the scope. The previous request information for throttling is stored in the cache and the classes override the <kbd>get_cache_key</kbd> method that determines the scope:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Throttling class name</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Description</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>AnonRateThrottle</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This class limits the rate of requests that an anonymous user can make. The IP address of the request is the unique cache key. Hence, bear in mind that all the requests coming from the same IP address will accumulate the total number of requests.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>UserRateThrottle</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This class limits the rate of requests that a specific user can make. For authenticated users, the authenticated user <kbd>id</kbd> is the unique cache key. For anonymous users, the IP address of the request is the unique cache key.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><kbd>ScopedRateThrottle</kbd></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This class limits the rate of requests for specific parts of the API identified with the value assigned to the <kbd>throttle_scope</kbd> property. The class is useful when we want to restrict access to specific parts of the API with different rates.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<p>We will use a combination of the three throttling classes to achieve our previously explained goals. Make sure you quit the Django development server.

            <article>
                
<p>Now, we will write additional test functions to improve the testing coverage. Specifically, we will write unit tests related to the player class-based views: <kbd>PlayerList</kbd> and <kbd>PlayerDetail</kbd>. Stay in the <kbd>tests.py</kbd> file in the <kbd>games_service/games</kbd> folder. Add the following code after the last line to declare a new function and new test functions. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_03</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/games-service/games/tests.py</kbd> file:</p>
<pre><strong>def create_player(client, name, gender):</strong> 
    url = reverse('player-list') 
    player_data = {'name': name, 'gender': gender} 
    player_response = client.post(url, player_data, format='json') 
    return player_response 
 
 
<strong>@pytest.mark.django_db 
def test_create_and_retrieve_player(client):</strong> 
    """ 
    Ensure we can create a new Player and then retrieve it 
    """ 
    new_player_name = 'Will.i.am' 
    new_player_gender = Player.MALE 
    response = create_player(client, new_player_name, new_player_gender) 
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED 
    assert Player.objects.count() == 1 
    assert Player.objects.get().name == new_player_name </pre>
<p>The code declares the <kbd>create_player</kbd> function that receives the desired <kbd>name</kbd> and <kbd>gender</kbd> for the new player as arguments. The method builds the URL and the data dictionary to compose and send an HTTP <kbd>POST</kbd> method to the view associated with the <kbd>player-list</kbd> view name, and returns the response generated by this request. The code uses the received <kbd>client</kbd> to access the <kbd>APIClient</kbd> instance that allows us to easily compose and send HTTP requests for testing. Many test functions will call the <kbd>create_player</kbd> function to create a player, and then compose and send other HTTP requests to the API.</p>
<p>The <kbd>test_create_and_retrieve_player</kbd> test function tests whether we can create a new <kbd>Player</kbd> object and then retrieve it. The method calls the previously explained <kbd>create_player</kbd> function and then uses <kbd>assert</kbd> to check for the following expected results:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <kbd>status_code</kbd> for the response is HTTP <kbd>201 Created</kbd> (<kbd>status.HTTP_201_CREATED</kbd>)</li>
<li>The total number of <kbd>Player</kbd> objects retrieved from the database is <kbd>1</kbd></li>
<li>The <kbd>name</kbd> attribute of the <kbd>Player</kbd> object retrieved from the database matches the description specified when we created the object</li>
<li>The <kbd>gender</kbd> attribute of the <kbd>Player</kbd> object retrieved from the database matches the description specified when we created the object</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay in the <kbd>tests.py</kbd> file in the <kbd>games_service/games</kbd> folder. Add the following code after the last line to declare new test functions. The code file for the sample is included in the <kbd>restful_python_2_08_03</kbd> folder, in the <kbd>Django01/games-service/games/tests.py</kbd> file:</p>
<pre><strong>@pytest.mark.django_db 
def test_create_duplicated_player(client):</strong> 
    """ 
    Ensure we can create a new Player and we cannot create a duplicate 
    """ 
    url = reverse('player-list') 
    new_player_name = 'Fergie' 
    new_player_gender = Player.FEMALE 
    post_response1 = create_player(client, new_player_name, new_player_gender) 
    assert post_response1.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED 
    post_response2 = create_player(client, new_player_name, new_player_gender) 
    assert post_response2.status_code == status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST 
 
 
<strong>@pytest.mark.django_db 
def test_retrieve_players_list(client):</strong> 
    """ 
    Ensure we can retrieve a player 
    """ 
    new_player_name = 'Vanessa Perry' 
    new_player_gender = Player.FEMALE 
    create_player(client, new_player_name, new_player_gender) 
    url = reverse('player-list') 
    get_response = client.get(url, format='json') 
    assert get_response.status_code == status.HTTP_200_OK 
    assert get_response.data['count'] == 1 
    assert get_response.data['results'][0]['name'] == new_player_name 
    assert get_response.data['results'][0]['gender'] == new_player_gender</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The code declares the following test functions whose names start with the <kbd>test_</kbd> prefix:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>test_create_duplicated_player</kbd>: This test function tests whether the unique constraints make it possible for us to create two players with the same name. The second time we compose and send an HTTP <kbd>POST</kbd> request with a duplicate player name, we should receive an HTTP <kbd>400 Bad Request</kbd> status code (<kbd>status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST</kbd>).</li>
<li><kbd>test_retrieve_player_list</kbd>: This test function tests whether we can retrieve a specific player by its <kbd>id</kbd> with an HTTP <kbd>GET</kbd> request.</li>
</ul>
<p>We just coded a few tests related to players to improve test coverage. However, we should definitely write more tests to cover all the features included in our API.Â </p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Now, we will use the <kbd>pytest</kbd> command to run the tests again. Make sure you run the following command in the Terminal or Command Prompt window in which you have activated the virtual environment, and that you are located within the <kbd>games_service</kbd> folder that has the <kbd>manage.py</kbd> file:</p>

<p>One of the biggest drawbacks related to Django and Django REST Framework is that each HTTP request is blocking. Thus, whenever the Django server receives an HTTP request, it doesn't start working on any other HTTP requests in the incoming queue until the server sends the response for the first HTTP request is received.</p>
<p>However, one of the great advantages of RESTful Web Services is that they are stateless; that is, they shouldn't keep a client state on any server. Our API is a good example of a stateless RESTful Web Service. Thus, we can make the API run on as many servers as necessary to achieve our scalability goals. Obviously, we must take into account that we can easily transform the database server ...</p></article></section></div>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Web Development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS</h1>
<p>This chapter marks the beginning of a series of five chapters on web programming with PyCharm, all of which will cover the development of general web applications. I have been looking forward to writing this section because this is my bread and butter. I have been developing web applications for as long as there has been a web. The professional edition of PyCharm contains something of a treat for web developers: a full copy of JetBrains’ <strong class="bold">WebStorm</strong>, which is provided through a pre-installed plugin. This means we get a lot more than just syntax highlighting for <strong class="bold">HTML</strong>, <strong class="bold">CSS</strong>, and <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong>! We also have full access to <strong class="bold">Node.js</strong> tooling and modern web UI frameworks such as <strong class="bold">React</strong>. I might be tempted to call it overkill, but it isn’t. The product I work on every day has a mixture of <strong class="bold">microservices</strong> written in <strong class="bold">Python 3</strong>, <strong class="bold">NodeJS</strong>, and <strong class="bold">React</strong> for the frontend. I leverage three different databases: <strong class="bold">Microsoft SQL Server</strong>, <strong class="bold">MongoDB</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Redis</strong>. I never have to leave PyCharm! As I just mentioned, I have robust tooling for JavaScript, NodeJS, and React built-in. The databases are all supported in PyCharm, which we’ll cover in <a href="B19644_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor266"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding Database Management with PyCharm</em>. I can create debug run configurations in PyCharm, run several services that communicate with each other via REST calls, and perform inter-service debugging. I can also place a breakpoint in the React frontend and another in a separate project using <strong class="bold">Flask</strong> or <strong class="bold">FastAPI</strong>; as I work through the application’s workflow, my breakpoints stop, regardless of which project I’m in or which language the project is using. I would not attempt this in any other IDE. Did I mention how excited I was to start writing this set of chapters? I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>The topics that will be discussed in this chapter include integrating common web programming languages (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) in PyCharm and how to develop with them in straightforward and intuitive ways. By the end of this chapter, you will have gained comprehensive knowledge of how to use the three languages so that you can start a web development project using PyCharm.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the process of web development</li>
<li>The options for working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code in PyCharm</li>
<li>How to implement live editing and debugging for web projects</li>
<li>How to work with HTML boilerplate options in PyCharm<a id="_idTextAnchor174"/></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>The following are the prerequisites for this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>A working installation of Python 3.10 or later.</li>
<li>A working installation of PyCharm Professional. If you are using the community edition, most of what we’ll cover in this chapter won’t work since you’ll only get limited HTML support. You can still work with CSS and JavaScript files, but the experience will be very limited compared to the professional edition.</li>
<li>The Chrome web browser. You will need it if you want to debug JavaScript code running in the browser.</li>
<li>A working installation of NodeJS and <strong class="bold">node package manager</strong> (<strong class="bold">npm</strong>). This is optional. You will only need these if you want to work with React or modern JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, Vue, or Express. React is an advanced topic and won’t be covered extensively beyond setting up and working with a React project.</li>
<li>I’ll be showing you how to use PyCharm’s deployment features. For this, I assume you understand how to deploy a web project to a remote host using a tool such as WinSCP or FileZilla, or how to transfer files using command-line tools such as <strong class="bold">secure copy</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCP</strong>) or <strong class="bold">file transfer </strong><strong class="bold">protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">FTP</strong>).</li>
<li>You can find the sample code for this chapter at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Application-Development-with-PyCharm---Second-Edition/tree/main/chapter-07">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Application-Development-with-PyCharm---Second-Edition/tree/main/chapter-07</a>. We covered how to clone the repository in <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Installation </em><em class="italic">and Configuration</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Introduction to HTML, JavaScript, and CSS</h1>
<p>I call these <em class="italic">the triumvirate of web development</em>. They constitute the most basic skills you can learn as you progress toward becoming a full stack web developer. The term <strong class="bold">full stack</strong>, when<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> referencing a full stack developer, just means you are skilled at developing the frontend portion of the application, along with the backend and the database. The next six chapters are devoted to full stack web development with PyCharm.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, only<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> one of the three languages we’ll be covering here is a programming language. <strong class="bold">Hypertext Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTML</strong>) is used to create the structure and layout of a web page or application UI. <strong class="bold">Cascading Style Sheets</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSS</strong>) is used to control the look of the UI while honoring the separation of <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>concerns: we split the layout of buttons, text, and interactive elements from the definitions of visual appearance. Neither HTML nor CSS has any ability to create any level of interactivity by themselves beyond a few CSS tricks, such as changing a button’s color when the user hovers their cursor over it.</p>
<p>The real interactivity in a web-based frontend comes from JavaScript, or as it is properly called, ECMAScript. About a<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> million internet years ago, a company called Netscape was battling for the hearts and minds of the nascent web browser user community. It was David versus Goliath, where Goliath was Microsoft. Netscape’s browser cost a small fee to license while Microsoft’s Internet Explorer was free, built into the Windows operating system, and sported a set of tools that allowed IT managers to centrally customize their browser’s behavior while rolling it out to large corporate user bases. Netscape’s value proposition was non-existent. They needed a game-changer.</p>
<p>At about this time, Sun Microsystems was heavily marketing its new flagship programming language<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> called <strong class="bold">Java</strong>. Like Netscape, Sun was plagued by competition from Microsoft, so the two teamed up. Netscape started creating what would become the in-browser programming language called ECMAScript, while Sun licensed the name Java with the understanding that the newly renamed JavaScript would never run anywhere but within a browser. Sun’s end game was to make sure everyone was using Java to create their web application backends, with Netscape winning the market share for frontend rendering by offering an interactive experience. JavaScript has absolutely nothing to do with Java beyond marketing. They are very different languages and should never be confused.</p>
<p>I’m going to assume you have some knowledge of the vast world of HTML development. I also want to remind you that this is a book on PyCharm and not web development. Given this is how I earn my living, my experience here is deep, and I will move from “this is an HTML tag” (that is the absolute basics) to “and here’s React” (that is, there be dragons if all you’ve ever done is Python work) pretty quickly. My only regret here is that Packt won’t let me write “there be dragons” in a scary horror film-style font. I’ll leave you references to books and other resources in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section of this chapter in case you want to learn more about frontend or full stack development in general.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Writing code with HTML</h1>
<p>HTML, like any other <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>code, is created within a text file. In the case of HTML, the text is highly structured using a set of HTML tags. You can think of the tags as being like keywords in a programming language, except these are set apart using angle brackets. Remember, HTML is for content structure and layout. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee (not Al Gore) as a way to present scientific journal articles on the internet’s predecessor called the <strong class="bold">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">DARPANET</strong>). This is an adjunct of the United States <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>Department of Defense. One problem in the scientific world with this was the time it took to publish a peer-reviewed journal article. In cases where science had to advance rapidly, we needed a format to electronically publish research without going through the peer review and print publication process, which can take months. HTML was designed to electronically mimic a paper publication. Since this is the case, it should be no surprise that the structure of HTML elements refers to a <strong class="bold">document object model</strong> (<strong class="bold">DOM</strong>). The<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> document is organized into paragraphs, headers, sub-headers, sections, figures, images, and the like. Consider this example:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Advances in the Application of Time Travel&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
    elit. Vestibulum tincidunt tempus lectus vitae
    euismod.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>This is an HTML document that is structured like a typical research paper. It has a title, which appears in the browser’s tab. <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag of the document, which might also <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>contain metadata and references to CSS files and JavaScript used on the page.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag holds the document’s contents. The head and body are enclosed within an HTML tag. Remember, the tags are enclosed in angle brackets; for example, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Every tag has an opening tag and a closing tag with content in between. For example, the header opens with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, the content, <em class="italic">Introduction</em>, is inserted, and the tag is closed with <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. The closing tag adds a forward slash to the matching element.</p>
<p>This structure enables the web browser to easily parse the document and display the content as an electronic page. In modern HTML, though, only the structure is defined. How the elements are laid out on the page, along with visual definitions for fonts, colors, sizes, and so on, are all controlled by an externally linked CSS document.</p>
<p>If we add this code to our earlier document, within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag, we get a page that looks very different in the browser:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;head&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Advances in the Application of Time Travel&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;</pre> <p>Note that the added link tag is a little different: it doesn’t have a closing tag. There are a few exceptions in HTML like this. Additionally, the link tag has some attributes attached. You can think of attributes as being like arguments for a function. They define additional input used by the tag. In this case, several different types of link tags are possible in HTML. We are defining this one as a stylesheet using the <code>rel</code> attribute. The <code>href</code> attribute tells the HTML page where to find the CSS file. Here, the page will be looking for a file called <code>mystyle.css</code> in the <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>same folder as the HTML file.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Creating HTML in PyCharm</h2>
<p>The HTML <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>frontend development experience is only available with PyCharm Professional. The community edition allows you to create HTML files in a Python project, but that’s about all. I’ll be strictly considering the professional edition in this chapter.</p>
<p>We’re going to create a new project, but this time, we’re not going to create a Python project. In fact, we’re not going to create a new project in PyCharm at all. PyCharm used to have the option to create an empty project. At some point, it was removed, but that’s OK. PyCharm projects are simply a folder with a <code>.idea</code> folder inside it.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Creating an empty project</h2>
<p>Creating an<a id="_idIndexMarker598"/> empty project, which will bypass the process of setting up a virtual environment, which we don’t need, is easy. Just make a folder somewhere on your computer. I created mine on the desktop and called it <code>html-project</code>. I like to name my projects that aren’t using Python in kebab case instead of snake case so that I can easily spot the difference. Naturally, you can call it whatever you like.</p>
<p>Make sure PyCharm doesn’t have an open project. If it does, use <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Close</strong> to close the current project.</p>
<p>Next, just drag your empty folder into PyCharm. You’ll get the usual <strong class="bold">Trust and Open Project</strong> dialog, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.1</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.1: Drag an empty folder onto the PyCharm project window to create an empty project with no Python environment" src="img/B19644_07_01.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.1: Drag an empty folder onto the PyCharm project window to create an empty project with no Python environment</p>
<p>You may have noticed that there are HTML project types in PyCharm Professional’s new project window and wonder why I am ignoring them. I would rather start you off with a basic example before<a id="_idIndexMarker599"/> I show you the HTML boilerplate project, which creates a whole site based on ideals established by Google. Let’s walk before we fly. If you are already a full stack veteran, don’t skip this section. Given this isn’t a book on HTML, I don’t intend to linger on the basics. I’m going to go over a few features in this simple example.</p>
<p>When you create a project in this way, it is effectively a Python project without an interpreter. You’ll get a message stating that the default Python installation is being used as an environment, which is fine. We won’t need it:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.2: Right-click the project folder to create a new HTML file" src="img/B19644_07_02.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.2: Right-click the project folder to create a new HTML file</p>
<p>You will be prompted to give the file a name. Call it <code>index.html</code>. This is the default file that will be displayed <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>on a web server, so it is the most common file you’d want to create first. PyCharm will generate a basic HTML page structure based on a template. More than that, though, PyCharm will prompt you to fill in the basic elements of the template as part of the creation process. Take a look at <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.3</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.3: PyCharm presents a template for you to fill in" src="img/B19644_07_03.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.3: PyCharm presents a template for you to fill in</p>
<p>This template only has one template variable in it: <code>Title</code>. As you can see, line 5 is highlighted and the word <code>Title</code> is highlighted even more. PyCharm is expecting you to type a title, then<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> press the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key. Doing this sets the title and then takes you straight down to the inside of the body tag.</p>
<p>Upon adding this code, a few things become evident:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the autocompletion you’ve come to expect with Python is also applied to HTML tags. Valid attributes are also supplied in code completion. You’ll notice this when you type in the link tag for the style sheet.</li>
<li>PyCharm will automatically create the closing tag for you. When you type <code>&lt;h1&gt;Introduction</code>, as soon as you complete the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, PyCharm will insert the <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> closer for you. Failure to close your tags can lead to layout issues or missing content.</li>
<li>The same documentation features for Python keywords and libraries exist for HTML. Hover over any element and you’ll see documentation for that element.</li>
<li>The same linting we saw in Python code is at play in the HTML code too. <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.4</em> shows the same kind of warnings in the same areas we saw when we talked about these features in the editor for Python code:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.4: We can see a lot of similarities between the editor’s treatment of Python and its treatment of HTML" src="img/B19644_07_04.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.4: We can see a lot of similarities between the editor’s treatment of Python and its treatment of HTML</p>
<p>The problem summary at the top of the screen (<em class="italic">1</em>) indicates that there are a few typographical errors. There aren’t really any, it’s just that the dictionary is assuming English, and my<a id="_idIndexMarker602"/> placeholder verbiage is in Latin. There is a warning, though. If you click the yellow triangle next to <em class="italic">1</em>, the problem window opens (<em class="italic">3</em>). I can also see a yellow warning marker at <em class="italic">2</em>. All these point to the fact that we have yet to create the CSS file referenced on line 6.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual things we normally see in the editor, we can see something new at <em class="italic">4</em>: there are a few icons that correspond to the web browsers PyCharm is aware of on your computer.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Previewing web pages</h2>
<p>Clicking any of the <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>browser icons will allow you to preview your code in that browser. In my case, I have three browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and PyCharm’s built-in preview window. These icons will fade in and out as your mouse cursor approaches the top right of the editor window.</p>
<p>In honor of Netscape’s shoutout at the beginning of this chapter, let’s take a look at Firefox in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.5</em> since it is Netscape’s successor:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.5: The browser launches and displays our page" src="img/B19644_07_05.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.5: The browser launches and displays our page</p>
<p>There are three things worth noting in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.5</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>PyCharm didn’t just open the page in the browser with a file:/// URL. If you want to do that, you can hold down <em class="italic">Alt</em> or <em class="italic">Option</em> when clicking the browser icon. In our case, PyCharm launched its internal web server. This is handy because previewing your work in the browser with a file:/// URL is very limiting. Many features simply won’t work.</li>
<li>The content in the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag appears as the title on the tab in the browser.</li>
<li>The year 1991 called and they want their website back. HTML just creates structure. This page is pretty ugly without the CSS. We should fix that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we do, though, I want<a id="_idIndexMarker604"/> to point out a nifty feature that PyCharm gives us: auto-reloading.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Reloading the browser view on save</h2>
<p>If you study the URL in the browser in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, you’ll notice the <code>RELOAD_ON_SAVE</code> attribute. You can probably guess what this does, but let’s cover it anyway. In <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.6</em>, I have tiled <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>my windows so that PyCharm is on the left, and my browser is on the right. This is a common configuration used by web developers, though it usually plays out on several monitors:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.6: PyCharm will automatically reload the page in the browser every time you save changes to the file" src="img/B19644_07_06.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.6: PyCharm will automatically reload the page in the browser every time you save changes to the file</p>
<p>I’ve added a second <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag that reads as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph I added later&lt;/p&gt;</pre> <p>The moment I pressed <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">S</em> (<em class="italic">Cmd</em> + <em class="italic">S</em> on Mac), the browser updated with the new content. This seriously speeds up development! This is hardly revolutionary; most editors support this in <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>some way, but so does PyCharm.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">The Live Edit plugin</p>
<p class="callout">In older versions of JetBrains IDEs that support HTML development, you used to need a plugin called Live Edit to get this auto-reload feature. You don’t need it anymore since the feature is integrated into the IDE.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Using the PyCharm HTML preview</h2>
<p>If you’d rather keep 100% of your work in PyCharm rather than have an external browser, there is a <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>new HTML preview feature, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.7</em>, that launches an internal version of the Chromium browser:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.7: The PyCharm preview window allows you to view your work in a Chromium browser window implemented as a PyCharm UI tab" src="img/B19644_07_07.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.7: The PyCharm preview window allows you to view your work in a Chromium browser window implemented as a PyCharm UI tab</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar, Chromium is the open source version of Chrome. This is important to note since over the years, I’ve seen a lot of web development products with goofy preview products <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>bundled in that bear little relevance to how your work will be displayed in a real browser.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Configuring the available browsers</h2>
<p>The browser icons that <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>appear as preview browsers are configurable. You can add or remove any browser on your computer to or from the configuration. You’ll find this by going to <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> under <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Web Browsers</strong>, and then <strong class="bold">Preview</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.8</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.8: You can add and remove browsers for preview and configure reload behaviors" src="img/B19644_07_08.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.8: You can add and remove browsers for preview and configure reload behaviors</p>
<p>I think you’ll find adding new browsers as easy as clicking the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon and locating the browser’s executable. If you’d like to remove the unsightly presence of Internet Explorer, just click it, and click the <strong class="bold">–</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Note the dropdown that allows you to set the default launch browser to the system default, which is the first in the list, or a custom path. You can also configure whether you see the launch icons for HTML files and/or XML files.</p>
<p>The reload behavior <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>can be configured at the bottom of the screen. You can set the reload to happen on save, on change, or turn it off. In my opinion, the <strong class="bold">On Change</strong> setting fires too often. I leave it set to <strong class="bold">On Save</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Navigating structure code with the structure window</h2>
<p>The structure window <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>allows you to view the structure of your code. Most of the time, the structure window just shows a list of functions and global variables. If you open a class file, you’ll see the properties and methods of the class. <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.09</em> shows what happens when you use the structure window with an HTML document:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.9: The structure window allows you to see and navigate the DOM in the code window" src="img/B19644_07_09.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.9: The structure window allows you to see and navigate the DOM in the code window</p>
<p>When you open the structure view on an HTML page, you can see and easily navigate the entire DOM structure of the HTML document.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Adding the CSS</h1>
<p>Right-click the project folder and <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>add a Stylesheet file called <code>mystyle.css</code>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.10</em>. You will be prompted to choose a Stylesheet type. We’re sticking to CSS files. The rest of the options are fancy, but they all transpile, usually via the <strong class="bold">Babel</strong> library and a <strong class="bold">WebPack</strong> build script, to regular CSS at the end of the day. If you are new to frontend work, I recommend learning plain CSS before branching off into exotic topics such as <strong class="bold">Less</strong> or <strong class="bold">Sass</strong>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.10: Create a new CSS file using File | New | Stylesheet" src="img/B19644_07_10.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.10: Create a new CSS file using File | New | Stylesheet</p>
<p>Be sure to name<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> the file <code>mystyle.css</code> so that it matches what we have in the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in our HTML file. It also needs to be in the same folder as <code>index.html</code>. Add this code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
body {
 background-color: lightblue;
 margin: 20px;
 font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
 font-size: 18px;
}
h1 {
 font-size: 32px;
 color: navy;
 text-decoration: underline;
}</pre> <p>Save the file and return to your browser. Don’t expect it to have updated; PyCharm’s reload feature is watching the <code>index.html</code> file, not the newly created <code>mystyle.css</code> file. Hit the reload button in your browser. I won’t bother with a black-and-white screenshot of a colored HTML page. The change should be immediately noticeable. Now that<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> the browser has loaded the CSS, you can edit the CSS in PyCharm. With each save, the page will update, just as it did when you edited the HTML in the <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<p>You no doubt noticed the excellent code completion as you typed in the CSS code. The color codes were all displayed by name, as well as hex value, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.11</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.11: As you type CSS color names, you’ll see the name, the hex value, and a preview of the color" src="img/B19644_07_11.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.11: As you type CSS color names, you’ll see the name, the hex value, and a preview of the color</p>
<p>There is a preview of the color next to the CSS color name as well so that you can see what color you’re setting.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Using color selectors</h2>
<p>You can set the<a id="_idIndexMarker615"/> color using a name or a hex value, or you can edit an existing color using the swatch, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.12</em>. Here, I’ve clicked the color swatch in the gutter on line 10 of the <code>mystyle.css</code> file:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.12: You can edit the color by clicking the swatch in the gutter and picking a new color</p>
<p>From here, I can pick the color using an RGBA or hex value or just drag the cursor around the color window. There’s a hue slider as well as a slider for the alpha channel. This controls the opacity, which the UI is displaying as a percentage rather than the traditional 0-255 integer value.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice that there is an eye dropper tool. You can use the eye dropper to select any color that’s visible on your screen. This allows you to, for example, match a color to be used on your type with a color from an image that’s visible on your screen.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/>Adding JavaScript</h1>
<p>It’s time to round out <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>our experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by adding some interactivity to our page. Right-click on the project folder and add a JavaScript file called <code>index.js</code>.</p>
<p>We’re going to add a button to our HTML file, then have that button react when we click it using JavaScript. We’ll write the JavaScript code first; then, we’ll go back and add the button.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-185"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Adding some JavaScript code</h2>
<p>Enter this code <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>into your <code>index.js</code> file:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
const btn = document.getElementById("btnClickMe");
const textDisplay = document.getElementById("textDisplay");
let clickCount = 0;</pre> <p>We’ll add some elements to the HTML file that are referenced in this JavaScript in a minute. First, we’ll add a button with an ID of <code>btnClickMe</code>. Then, we’ll add a span tag inside a paragraph with an ID of <code>textDisplay</code>. Finally, we’ll create a variable called <code>clickCount</code>. You can probably see where this is going. When you load the page, the value of <code>clickCount</code> will be <code>0</code>. Each time you click the button, we increment the <code>clickCount</code> variable, then update the HTML within the span tag to reflect the new value.</p>
<p>To make this work, we need an <code>onclick</code> handler for the button. Add this code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
btn.onclick = function() {
    clickCount++;
    textDisplay.textContent = String(clickCount);
}</pre> <p>The button’s <code>onclick</code> handler is assigned to the anonymous function, which increments <code>clickCount</code> and updates the display. I even went the extra mile and cast <code>clickCount</code> to a string.</p>
<p>With our JavaScript in <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>place, let’s update our HTML.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-186"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Adding the elements to the HTML file</h2>
<p>Now, let’s go <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>back to the <code>index.html</code> file and add two new elements. First, we'll add a text area:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;p&gt;You have clicked the button
  &lt;span id="textDisplay"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
times. &lt;/p&gt;</pre> <p>Next, let’s add a button:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;button id="btnClickMe"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</pre> <p>The button has an ID attribute of <code>btnClickMe</code>, which I used in the JavaScript to the <code>onclick</code> event in the browser. Each time the <code>clickCount</code>. Then, the function changes the text that appears in the span tag with an <code>id</code> of <code>textArea</code>.</p>
<p>We’re almost done! We just <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>need to add a script tag to the bottom of the HTML file. Add this line just above the closing body tag:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="img/index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre> <p>This line will load your JavaScript file after all the HTML has loaded into the browser window. Manually refresh your browser. You can click the <strong class="bold">Click me</strong> button and see the counter increment. You can see mine in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.13</em>:</p>

<p>As you were working, you no doubt took advantage of the usual code completion we’ve been discussing. That’s pretty nice, right? But it gets even better! I’m going to show you how to debug from your IDE. Normally, you’d have to rely solely on the debugging tools in your browser, which means switching back and forth between the code display in your browser and your IDE. I have, at least once or twice, forgotten which tool I was in and found myself<a id="_idIndexMarker621"/> trying to directly edit in the browser’s debugging tool. This works, except that it doesn’t save your file back to the actual code file. Admittedly, this only happens when I’m really tired, but with two middle-school-aged daughters, a full-time job running a development team, and writing books, I’m pretty much always really tired. I did mention earlier that the debugger is my favorite feature, so without further ado, I give you client-side JavaScript debugging!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Debugging client-side JavaScript</h2>
<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>debug the JavaScript that runs in your browser by setting up Google Chrome as your default browser. Chrome has a very good remote debugging server built into the browser. PyCharm can connect to it and display the debugging information directly in the PyCharm UI, just as it would appear when we debugged Python code back in <a href="B19644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Seamless Testing, Debugging, </em><em class="italic">and Profiling</em>.</p>
<p>Open the <code>index.js</code> file and set a breakpoint in our click handler function on line 7, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.14</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.14: By setting a breakpoint in your client-side code, you can debug your client-side JavaScript just as easily as you can debug Python code" src="img/B19644_07_14.jpg"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.14: By setting a breakpoint in your client-side code, you can debug your client-side JavaScript just as easily as you can debug Python code</p>
<p>To use the JavaScript <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>debugger directly in PyCharm, you need to create a run configuration. We covered creating run configurations in detail in <em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Seamless Testing, Debugging, and Profiling</em>. To create a run configuration that’s capable of working with a JavaScript file loaded into HTML, create a run configuration using the JavaScript Debug template, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.15</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.15: Use the JavaScript Debug template to set up a run configuration that allows you to debug your JavaScript code directly in PyCharm" src="img/B19644_07_15.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.15: Use the JavaScript Debug template to set up a run configuration that allows you to debug your JavaScript code directly in PyCharm</p>
<p>Once you’ve selected<a id="_idIndexMarker624"/> the template, you’ll see a settings screen, similar to the one in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.16</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.16: Fill in the settings to run your HTML page, which loads your JavaScript for debugging" src="img/B19644_07_16.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.16: Fill in the settings to run your HTML page, which loads your JavaScript for debugging</p>
<p>The key settings fields are numbered in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.16</em>.</p>
<p>At position <em class="italic">1</em>, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> fill in a name for the run configuration. It can be anything you like since the name doesn’t affect the workings of the run configuration. For the URL, you want to click the folder icon at <em class="italic">2</em> and just browse to your <code>index.html</code> file. When you do that, PyCharm will fill in the localhost URL, along with the port number used by PyCharm’s built-in web server. The selection at <em class="italic">3</em> determines which web browser is launched. PyCharm only supports debugging in browsers based on Chromium. For example, Chrome, Chromium, Edge, or Brave would work fine, but Safari or Firefox would not.</p>
<p>The setting at <em class="italic">4</em> is important since it loads your JavaScript breakpoints before the <code>OnPageLoad</code> event fires. If you are using JavaScript that loads based on an <code>$(function()</code> call, you should check <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>this box. Our script is very simple, so for me, it’s fine to leave this unchecked. Note that checking this box will slow the load time for your debugger to start.</p>
<p>To start your <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>debugging session, click the usual debugging button. If you don’t remember where this is, refer back to <a href="B19644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>. Chrome will launch with your web page. Upon clicking the <strong class="bold">Click me</strong> button we made earlier, the debugger in PyCharm should intercept the event. As with our debugger coverage in <a href="B19644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, you can use all the same features to inspect and step through your JavaScript code.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Working with Emmet templating</h2>
<p>Emmet is a<a id="_idIndexMarker628"/> powerful and widely used plugin in PyCharm that provides an efficient and streamlined way of writing HTML, <strong class="bold">JavaScript XML</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSX</strong>), and CSS code. It offers a<a id="_idIndexMarker629"/> range of templating features that significantly boost developer productivity and speed up the coding process. By leveraging the Emmet abbreviations and snippets, developers can write code snippets in a shorthand syntax and expand them into complete HTML or CSS structures with just a few keystrokes. The only downside is that you need to learn and memorize the Emmet abbreviations. I don’t have the space to turn this into an Emmet tutorial. There is a cheat sheet available at <a href="https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/">https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/</a>.</p>
<p>To use Emmet in PyCharm, you only need to type some Emmet shorthand into the editor window and press <em class="italic">Tab</em>. For instance, by typing <code>ul&gt;li.item$*5</code>, followed by pressing the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key, Emmet can generate an unordered list with five list items, where the <code>$</code> symbol is automatically incremented for each item. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with repetitive HTML structures and eliminates the need to manually type out repetitive code blocks.</p>
<p>Another powerful feature of Emmet in PyCharm is that you can navigate and edit HTML and CSS code efficiently. With the <strong class="bold">Go to Edit Point</strong> feature, developers can navigate between predefined edit points within an expanded abbreviation, allowing for quick modifications and adjustments. Additionally, Emmet’s automatic tag closing feature ensures that HTML<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> tags are automatically closed, reducing the chance of syntax errors and saving time in the coding process. The <strong class="bold">Go to Edit Point</strong> feature effectively allows you to put placeholders in the code template. If you tried out the earlier example with the unordered list, you might have noticed that the code was generated, but your cursor was sitting inside the first list item tag, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.17</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.17: Emmet generated the unordered list thanks to the edit point defined in the template" src="img/B19644_07_17.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.17: Emmet generated the unordered list thanks to the edit point defined in the template</p>
<p>Emmet also provides intelligent CSS abbreviations that simplify the process of writing and expanding CSS properties. By using shortcuts such as “bg” for “background” or “p” for “padding,” developers <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>can quickly generate CSS code snippets without having to remember the full property names. This feature speeds up the CSS development process and enhances code readability.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>HTML project types in PyCharm Professional</h1>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned that I wanted to start you off with a basic empty project with some simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code we created from scratch. PyCharm Professional offers new additional pure<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> HTML project types. By pure, I mean they don’t use any modern JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular. These modern frameworks represent a paradigm shift in frontend development. A pure HTML project will continue to use very traditional DOM manipulation, as we did in our JavaScript example earlier. To change the content of our click counter span, we used this code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
Document.getElementById</pre> <p>Since client-side JavaScript like this runs in the browser, the code has access to the document object, which is effectively the browser window. JavaScript can manipulate the currently loaded document or even update the contents of the browser window itself.</p>
<p>Modern JavaScript frameworks no longer manipulate the DOM. Instead, they rely on a state change mechanism coupled with the idea of a shadow DOM. In the case of React, your program, which consists mainly of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML markup generated by JSX, maintains a component-driven state machine. Changes to the state trigger events within the React framework, which, in turn, trigger a re-render of the affected areas in the UI.</p>
<p>This is a fairly complicated paradigm to explain to the uninitiated, and since this isn’t a book on modern JavaScript, I’ll punt the idea of a deeper explanation to other books in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>There are two project types we can look at that are DOM-based. Let’s check them out.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>HTML 5 Boilerplate</h2>
<p>The <strong class="bold">HTML 5 Boilerplate</strong> (<strong class="bold">H5BP</strong>) project can be found at <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">https://html5boilerplate.com/</a>. This project has been around since 2011, and it represents a site<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> generation tool that epitomizes HTML development best practices. If you could generate a 100% by-the-book website as a starting point, and then alter it to make pretty much anything, you’d have H5BP.</p>
<p>Here are a few of its key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A well-thought-out and structured <code>index.html</code> file replete with metadata tags and every optimization you could want. Just add content.</li>
<li><code>Normalize.css</code> and <code>Main.css</code> take care of your CSS resets and provide some base styles for helpers, media queries for responsive design, and even print-friendly options.</li>
<li>Google Analytics baked in.</li>
<li>The Modernizr library is included so that you can detect which browser is running your code and react accordingly.</li>
<li>Server setting files so that you can deliver performance and security.</li>
<li>Placeholder icons for mobile devices, favicons, and progressive web apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said, it is the ultimate HTML 5 starter kit for any website that doesn’t lock you into a lot. Older versions use jQuery, but like so many other frameworks, more recent builds remove it as a dependency should you not want to use it.</p>
<p>Let’s create an H5BP project in PyCharm. Click <code>h5bp</code> and I’m just putting it in the default PyCharm <code>Projects</code> folder on my computer.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, PyCharm will generate a large project using H5BP via npm. <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.18</em> shows my generated project:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.18: My HTML 5 Boilerplate project with index.html open" src="img/B19644_07_18.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.18: My HTML 5 Boilerplate project with index.html open</p>
<p>Wow! Just look at all that code you didn’t have to type, look up, or remember! With a more extensive<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> project loaded, let’s look at a few helpful features that I haven’t pointed out yet.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Previewing and editing graphics with external tools</h2>
<p>You can preview <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>graphics in PyCharm by simply double-clicking the file. I’ll open the <code>tile.png</code> file, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.19</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.19: You can view graphics in PyCharm by simply opening them" src="img/B19644_07_19.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.19: You can view graphics in PyCharm by simply opening them</p>
<p>I may have<a id="_idIndexMarker636"/> teased you a bit by implying that you can edit images in PyCharm. You can’t. But you can configure an external editor that will launch when you open a graphic.</p>
<p>Launch the settings window and find <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">External Tools</strong>. Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the top toolbar. In <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.20</em>, I’m <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>setting up the <strong class="bold">Gnu Image Manipulation Program</strong> (<strong class="bold">GIMP</strong>), which is an open source alternative to <strong class="bold">Adobe Photoshop</strong>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.20: You can configure GIMP as an external editor to open images in your project" src="img/B19644_07_20.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.20: You can configure GIMP as an external editor to open images in your project</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong here: I prefer Photoshop. If you<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> have it, use that. It doesn’t run in Linux (to me, Wine doesn’t count), so GIMP is the next best thing. Any kind of file that PyCharm can’t edit can benefit from an external editor. Another good addition I often make is <strong class="bold">Inkscape</strong> or <strong class="bold">Adobe Illustrator</strong> for<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> working with <strong class="bold">Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> (<strong class="bold">SVG</strong>) files. These are useful because they are resolution independent. Likewise, if you serve PDF files, adding <strong class="bold">Adobe Acrobat</strong> or some other program to manipulate PDFs is a good candidate for adding as an external tool.</p>
<p>To open a file in the external editor, just right-click the file, click the <strong class="bold">External Tools</strong> menu option, and select the appropriate external tool.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Uploading your site to a server</h2>
<p>Many large sites and <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>software projects use a continuous deployment system to deploy code to servers. If your project isn’t that far along yet, or maybe you just need something simple, PyCharm has a publishing mechanism designed to help you easily publish a website or application. For that matter, it can be used to publish any kind of software, but I most often see it used to deploy web projects to web servers.</p>
<p>You’ll find the deployment configuration and tools in the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> menu, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.21</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.21: The deployment settings and tools can be found by going to Tools | Deployment" src="img/B19644_07_21.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.21: The deployment settings and tools can be found by going to Tools | Deployment</p>
<p>The process of <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>setting up deployment entails configuring one or more remote servers. Let’s take a look at how this is done.</p>
<h3>Configuring the remote server</h3>
<p>Click the <strong class="bold">Configuration…</strong> menu option shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.21</em>. You’ll be greeted by a plain gray<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> window that says <strong class="bold">Please add a web server to configure</strong>. Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon in the top-left corner of the window and select the type of connection you intend to use. You can see the choices in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.22</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.22: Select the type of server connection you’d like to use" src="img/B19644_07_22.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.22: Select the type of server connection you’d like to use</p>
<p>You have several <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>connection protocols from which to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Secure File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">SFTP</strong>). This should be your go-to. Out of the options on the list, it is the <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>most secure since it relies on the <strong class="bold">Secure Shell </strong><strong class="bold">Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSH</strong>).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">File Transfer Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">FTP</strong>). In the real world, you should never use this option. FTP by itself sends all of its authentication data in an unencrypted text stream. Only use it if you want your site to be hacked.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">File Transfer Protocol Secured</strong> (<strong class="bold">FTPS</strong>) is FTP with <strong class="bold">Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSL</strong>) encryption. The <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>same encryption certificates you’d use to secure your website with HTTPS can be used with FTP to become FTPS.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning</strong> (<strong class="bold">WebDAV</strong>) was created back in the day when companies such as Microsoft and Macromedia (which were bought by Adobe) were selling web authoring tools for web designers – that is to say, people who write HTML but who aren’t overly technical. Most of them died in the great developer rebellion of 1998. WebDAV allowed an authoring tool to connect to a server seamlessly with minimal fuss. Like FTP, though, it has its share of security issues. I don’t recommend using it.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Local or mounted folder</strong> is used when you have direct network access to the folder being used to serve your site or application.</li>
<li><code>build</code>, then copy the necessary files into that folder. I find the <strong class="bold">Local or mounted folder</strong> option to be more useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to walk you through connecting to a server using SFTP. When you click the <code>Web Server</code>, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.23</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.23: Give your server a descriptive name" src="img/B19644_07_23.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.23: Give your server a descriptive name</p>
<p>Next, you’ll need credentials. You generally get these from your friendly local system administrator or hosting service. These are entered into an SSH configuration, which is distinct from your deployment server configuration. The UI gets a little bit funky right here. To set up the SSH configuration, click the ellipsis button shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.24</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.24: Creating a deployment requires you to also create an SSH configuration by clicking the ellipsis shown here" src="img/B19644_07_24.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.24: Creating a deployment requires you to also create an SSH configuration by clicking the ellipsis shown here</p>
<p>This brings up yet another empty gray window. Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> sign in the top corner of this window and you’ll see a screen like mine, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.25</em>.</p>
<p>Fill in your connection details – that is, your host, port, username, and password. Besides a password, you can also use SSH keys or a connection to an OpenSSH config and authentication<a id="_idIndexMarker647"/> agent. I’ll keep it simple and stick with a password. Clicking the <strong class="bold">Test Connection</strong> button tells me whether or not my credentials are working.</p>
<p>Next, we need a root path. This should be the root of your web server’s document folder, assuming you mean to deploy a website. There is an autodetect button there that will find the SSH user’s home folder. This is fine if you’re serving from that location. It is common to serve from a location such as <code>/var/www/html</code> on the remote server. If that is the folder your server uses, make sure your system admin gives you the credentials needed to access that location.</p>
<p>Below that, you’ll see an entry for the web server’s URL. The root path on the server should map to the web server URL. You can see my settings in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.25</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.25: My deployment settings (so far)" src="img/B19644_07_25.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.25: My deployment settings (so far)</p>
<p>Your next <a id="_idIndexMarker648"/>stop is the <strong class="bold">Mappings</strong> tab. <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.26</em> shows the <strong class="bold">Mappings</strong> tab with a mapping specified:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.26: The Mappings tab specifies the mappings between the folders on your computer and the folders on the server" src="img/B19644_07_26.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.26: The Mappings tab specifies the mappings between the folders on your computer and the folders on the server</p>
<p>For a web project, you <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>usually just need one mapping between the folder containing your code on your computer, and the document root of the web server. Next, switch to the <strong class="bold">Excluded Paths</strong> tab, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.27</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.27: Exclude paths you don’t need to copy to the server" src="img/B19644_07_27.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.27: Exclude paths you don’t need to copy to the server</p>
<p>Exclude any files you don’t want to be copied. You can specify local files that shouldn’t be copied to the server, and remote files that should not be copied down to your computer. I added <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>the contents of the <code>doc</code> folder, which contains documentation for the developer, and the contents of the <code>.idea</code> folder, which is used by PyCharm. Click <strong class="bold">OK</strong>, and your deployment will be configured.</p>
<h3>Uploading to the server</h3>
<p>You are now ready to<a id="_idIndexMarker651"/> upload your project. Go back to the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Deployment</strong> menu, and this time, click <strong class="bold">Upload to Web Server</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.28</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.28: The upload controls are in the deployment menu" src="img/B19644_07_28.jpg"/>

<p>If you named your<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> remote server something besides Web Server, that is what will appear in the menu. You will be asked to confirm the upload operation. PyCharm will display a message stating that the upload was successful, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.29</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.29: The index.html file was successfully transferred" src="img/B19644_07_29.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.29: The index.html file was successfully transferred</p>
<p>The upload operation only copied the open <code>index.html</code> file. We can check this by clicking <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> | <strong class="bold">Deployment</strong> | <strong class="bold">Browse Remote Host</strong>. This brings up a view of the remote host, allowing<a id="_idIndexMarker653"/> you to see the files on the host. You can see mine in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.30</em>:</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.30: You can view the mapped project root folder on the server</p>
<p>You probably want to transfer the whole site rather than just the open file. Right-click inside the remote host window and click <strong class="bold">Upload here</strong>, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.31</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.31: Right-click and then select Upload here to upload the whole site" src="img/B19644_07_31.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.31: Right-click and then select Upload here to upload the whole site</p>
<p>As you can see from the menu, you have full graphical control over files on the server, including all file operations, such as rename, copy, or delete. You can compare operations that will diff the local file with the remote, and of course, the file operations are two-way, so<a id="_idIndexMarker654"/> you can synchronize work done directly on the server back to your computer.</p>
<p>All in all, this tool is more capable than a standalone file transport program such as FileZilla. It is integrated directly into the IDE, and there is even an auto-sync setting that uploads the local copy to the remote whenever you save a file. PyCharm has everything you need to work on the HTML frontend of a website or application, including the ability to publish right from PyCharm.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor196"/>Creating a Bootstrap project</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> another DOM-oriented HTML 5 project type you can use in PyCharm Professional. This one is more useful if you are building an application rather than a website. Bootstrap is a library of styled HTML components developed by Twitter that help users rapidly develop applications. Essentially, you can make a nice-looking application by simply generating this project, then copying and pasting Bootstrap snippets for elements such as buttons, card layouts, sliders, switches, and a mobile-first grid system.</p>
<p>You can create a Bootstrap project by clicking <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Project</strong>, then picking <strong class="bold">Bootstrap</strong> from the templates on the right, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7</em><em class="italic">.32</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.32: Creating a Bootstrap project" src="img/B19644_07_32.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.32: Creating a Bootstrap project</p>
<p>All this<a id="_idIndexMarker656"/> template does is create a <code>js</code> folder and a <code>css</code> folder. PyCharm then downloads Bootstrap and places the library files in their respective folders. That’s it. It doesn’t even generate an <code>index.html</code> file for you. It is just a quick way to set up a project with Bootstrap.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor197"/>Working with modern JavaScript and NodeJS</h1>
<p>PyCharm has all its features <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>and templates available in the Web Storm product, which is designed for working with modern JavaScript projects. Since I assume you are mostly interested in Python projects, I won’t spend a lot of time delving into the details of server-side JavaScript development since we will be covering the Python options, such as Flask, FastAPI, Pyramid, and Django, in the next few chapters.</p>
<p>However, you should <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>know that if you have JavaScript projects and Python projects, there is no need to buy two separate products.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-195"><a id="_idTextAnchor198"/>Creating a NodeJS project</h2>
<p>To create a new Node JS project, just click <code>NodeJS</code> project template. This is the equivalent of generating a project with the <code>npm init -y</code> command. All you get is a <a id="_idIndexMarker659"/>generic <code>package.json</code> file. It is pretty bare-bones, but it does save you the trouble of firing up a terminal and running the <code>init</code> command.</p>
<p>In addition to a basic Node project, you can also generate a <strong class="bold">Next.js</strong> project or an <strong class="bold">Express</strong> project. Express is JavaScript’s answer to Flask, which we’ll cover in the next chapter. It is used to develop the backend of your project. Next.JS, on the other hand, is a fusion of frontend and backend <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>development with an easy-to-use hosting service. For more on this, see <a href="https://nextjs.org">https://nextjs.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-196"><a id="_idTextAnchor199"/>Creating a React project</h2>
<p>React is one of the most popular frontend frameworks available today. It represents a paradigm shift in frontend development<a id="_idIndexMarker661"/> as it doesn’t use the DOM to manipulate the way a web UI looks. Instead of using the DOM to show and hide components<a id="_idIndexMarker662"/> in a <strong class="bold">single-page application</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPA</strong>) as appropriate, you instead manipulate a state object, which causes React to update the page.</p>
<p>React UIs are developed as a set of components that work together along with life cycle methods or hooks to handle traditional or even custom events. I’m showing a little more work with React here because it is what I use in my daily work, and because in a later chapter, I’ll present how to use FastAPI with a React frontend.</p>
<p>Creating a React project is as easy as the others we’ve seen so far. Just click <code>create-react-app</code>, which is normally executed from the command line:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 7.33: Create React App can be run from the PyCharm GUI" src="img/B19644_07_33.jpg"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.33: Create React App can be run from the PyCharm GUI</p>
<p>PyCharm also gives you an easy way to select between JavaScript, which is the default, and TypeScript, which<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> is the preference for many developers. TypeScript is a variant of JavaScript pioneered by Microsoft in the wake of Douglas Crockford’s book titled <em class="italic">JavaScript, the Good Parts</em>. TypeScript aims to fix many of the bad parts, such as the lack of a strong type system.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor200"/>Other frontend frameworks</h2>
<p>PyCharm has support for several other modern frontend frameworks.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Angular</strong> is like React in <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>that it uses components driven by a state machine. The biggest difference, besides being infamous for major releases not being<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> backward compatible, is bi-directional communications between components. In React, properties drill down from top to bottom. In Angular, communications between components go both directions. This can make your applications harder to debug.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">React Native</strong> is an<a id="_idIndexMarker666"/> offshoot of React that’s <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>designed to create native user experiences for mobile and desktop applications. The latest edition of the .NET framework from Microsoft includes a React Native variant for creating Windows user interfaces for<a id="_idIndexMarker668"/> desktop applications.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Vite</strong> is a modern<a id="_idIndexMarker669"/> framework that aims to solve performance problems associated with bloat. It is easy for a project in any other framework to require <a id="_idIndexMarker670"/>dozens or even hundreds of JavaScript module imports, which slows the performance of development and the application itself. Vite uses advanced bundling tools to streamline the frontend development process.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Vue</strong> is yet another<a id="_idIndexMarker671"/> frontend framework that provides a declarative<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> component-based programming model. While React relies heavily on JSX, Vue uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be configured to include elements such as routing, server-side rendering, and more.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor201"/>Summary</h1>
<p>This chapter covered using PyCharm as a frontend development tool for web pages and applications. We discovered PyCharm has a very rich set of capabilities in this area because the JetBrains Web Storm product is integrated directly into PyCharm Professional as a pre-installed plugin.</p>
<p>This provides all the functionality of a robust, dedicated tool specializing in the development of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. All the same debugging capabilities available to us in Python are also afforded in JavaScript code, whether it be client or server side. While we didn’t spend any time talking about server-side JavaScript, the capability to work with NodeJS projects is there.</p>
<p>PyCharm Professional gives us a great many project templates in both traditional DOM-based development strategies, such as HTML 5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap, and modern state machine-based systems such as Angular and React.</p>
<p>We learned how to leverage PyCharm’s deployment tools to upload sites and applications to remote servers. We also learned how to configure external tools such as image editors so that they’re launched directly from PyCharm.</p>
<p>Having covered the frontend tooling, in the next chapter, we will discover how to develop a full stack web application using the Flask framework.</p>

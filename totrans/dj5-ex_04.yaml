    other. Users will be able to bookmark any image on the internet and share it with
    other users. They will also be able to see activity on the platform from the users
    they follow and like/unlike the images shared by them.

    of the default `auth` `User` model, since Django allows you to define custom user
    models. These fields will be validated according to the validations of their corresponding

    to clean the value or raise form validation errors for a specific field. Forms
    also include a general `clean()` method to validate the entire form, which is
    useful to validate fields that depend on each other. In this case, we use the
    field-specific `clean_password2()` validation instead of overriding the `clean()`
    method of the form. This avoids overriding other field-specific checks that the

- en: While the user model provided by Django’s authentication framework is sufficient
    for most typical scenarios, it does have a limited set of predefined fields. If
    you want to capture additional details relevant to your application, you may want
    to extend the default user model. For example, the default user model comes with
    the `first_name` and `last_name` fields, a structure that may not align with naming
    conventions in various countries. Additionally, you may want to store further
    user details or construct a more comprehensive user profile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A simple way to extend the user model is by creating a profile model that contains
    a one-to-one relationship with the Django user model, and any additional fields.
    A one-to-one relationship is similar to a `ForeignKey` field with the parameter
    `unique=True`. The reverse side of the relationship is an implicit one-to-one
    relationship with the related model instead of a manager for multiple elements.
    From each side of the relationship, you access a single related object.

    use `AUTH_USER_MODEL` to refer to the user model instead of pointing to the `auth.User`
    model directly. This makes our code more generic, as it can operate with custom-defined
    user models. With `on_delete=models.CASCADE`, we force the deletion of the related
    `Profile` object when a `User` object gets deleted.

- en: The `photo` field is an `ImageField`. We have made this field optional with
    `blank=True`. An `ImageField` field manages the storage of image files. It validates
    that the file provided is a valid image, stores the image file in the directory
    indicated with the `upload_to` parameter, and stores the relative path to the
    file in the related database field. An `ImageField` field is translated to a `VARHAR(100)`
    column in the database by default. A blank string will be stored if the value
    is left empty.

    more about this method at [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/customizing/#substituting-a-custom-user-model](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/auth/customizing/#substituting-a-custom-user-model).

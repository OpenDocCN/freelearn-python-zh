    are going to discuss libraries and frameworks that enable retrieving data from
    the Web (for example, get weather updates), upload data to a remote server (for
    example, log sensor data), or control appliances on a local network. We will also
    discuss topics that will help with learning the core topics of this chapter.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So far, we have reviewed and tested all our examples assuming the ideal condition,
    that is, the execution of the program will encounter no errors. On the contrary,
    applications fail from time to time either due to external factors, such as invalid
    user input and poor Internet connectivity, or program logic errors caused by the
    programmer. In such cases, we want the program to report/log the nature of error
    and either continue its execution or clean up resources before exiting the program.
    The `try`/`except` keywords offer a mechanism to trap an error that occurs during
    a program's execution and take remedial action. Because it is possible to trap
    and log an error in crucial parts of the code, the `try`/`except` keywords are
    especially useful while debugging an application.

    it is important to keep the `try...except` block as short as possible. Because

    input into an integer, we wrap it in a `try...except` block to trap an error.

    in a program's execution due to an error. It enables logging the error and taking
    remedial action. Similar to the `try...except` block, there are also `try...except...else`
    and `try...except...else` code blocks. Let's quickly review those options with
    a couple of examples.

    is available for download along with this chapter as `try_except_else.py`. In
    this example, the program compares the user input against the random number only
    if a valid user input was received. It otherwise skips the `else` block and goes
    back to the top of the loop to accept the next user input. Thus, `try...except...else` is
    used when we want a specific code block to be executed when no exceptions are
    raised due to the code in the `try` block.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

    on leaving the `try` block. This block of code is executed even after an exception
    is raised. This is useful in scenarios where we need to clean up resources and
    free up memory before moving on to the next stage.

    executed while exiting the `try...except` block (useful for cleaning up resources

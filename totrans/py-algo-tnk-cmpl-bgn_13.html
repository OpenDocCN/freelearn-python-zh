<h3 id="toc_1">7.1 The Value Assignment Operator</h3>
<p class="my_basic">The most commonly used operator in Python is the value assignment operator ( = ). For example, the following Python statement assigns a value of 5 to variable x.</p>
<div><p>x = 5</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">As you read in <a href="chapter05.html">Chapter 5</a>, this is equivalent to the left arrow used in flowcharts.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width9" src="img/chapter07-01.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Probably the left arrow used in a flowchart is more convenient and clearer than the ( = ) sign because it visually illustrates that the value or the result of an expression on the right is assigned to a variable on the left.</p>
<p class="my_basic">It's important to note that the ( = ) sign is not equivalent to the one used in mathematics. In mathematics, the expression x = 5 is read as “x is equal to 5”. However, in Python the expression x = 5 is read as “assign the value 5 to x” or “set x equal to 5”. They look the same but they act differently!</p>
<p class="my_basic">For instance, in mathematics, the following two lines are equivalent. The first one can be read as “x is equal to the sum of y and z” and the second one as “the sum of y and z is equal to x”.</p>
<div><p>x = y + z</p>
<p>y + z = x</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">On the other hand, in Python, these two statements are definitely not equivalent. The first statement is a valid Python statement, conveying “Assign the sum of y and z to x”. The second statement, however, is invalid, as it attempts to assign the value of x to y + z , which is not permissible in Python!</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>In Python, the variable on the left side of the ( = ) sign represents a region in main memory (RAM) where a value can be stored.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>On the left side of the ( = ) sign only variables can exist, whereas on the right side there can be a number, a variable, a string, or even a complex mathematical expression.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In Table 7-1 you can find some examples of value assignments.</p>
<div><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="my_table">

<p class="caption">Table 7-1 Examples of value assignments</p>
<p class="my_basic">Confused about the last one? Are you thinking about your math teachers right now? What would their reaction be if you had written x = x + 1 on the blackboard? Can you personally imagine a number that equals itself plus one? This statement suggests that 5 is equal to 6 and 10 is equal to 11, which is, of course, incorrect!</p>
<p class="my_basic">Obviously, things are different in computer science. The statement x = x + 1 is absolutely valid! It instructs the CPU to retrieve the value of variable x from main memory (RAM), to add 1 to that value, and to assign the result back to variable x. The old value of variable x is replaced by the new one.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Still don't get it? Let's take a look at how the CPU and main memory (RAM) cooperate with each other in order to execute the statement x = x + 1.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's say that there is a region in memory, named x and it contains the number 13.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width32" src="img/chapter07-02.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">When a program instructs the CPU to execute the statement:</p>
<div><p>x = x + 1</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">the following procedure is carried out:</p>
<p>►the number 13 is transferred from the RAM's region named x to the CPU;</p>
<p>►the CPU calculates the sum of 13 and 1; and</p>
<p>►the result, 14, is transferred from the CPU to the RAM's region x replacing the existing number, 13.</p>
<p class="my_basic">After execution, the RAM looks like this.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width15" src="img/chapter07-03.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Now that you have understood everything, let's delve into some final details. In Python, you can assign a single value to multiple variables with one single statement. The following statement:</p>
<div><p>a = b = c = 4</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">assigns the value of 4 to all three variables a, b, and c.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In Python, you can also assign multiple values to multiple variables with one single statement. This is called simultaneous assignment. The following statement assigns the value of 2 to variable a, the value of 10 to variable b, and the value of 3 to variable c.</p>
<div><p>a, b, c = 2, 10, 3</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_2">7.2 Arithmetic Operators</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Just like every high-level programming language, Python supports almost all types of arithmetic operators, as presented in the table that follows.</p>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The first two operators are straightforward and need no further explanation.</p>
<p class="my_basic">If you need to multiply two numbers or the content of two variables you have to use the asterisk ( * ) symbol. For example, if you want to multiply 2 times y, you must write 2 * y.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In mathematics it is legal to skip the multiplication operator and write 3x, meaning “3 times x”. In Python, however, you must always use an asterisk anywhere a multiplication operation exists. This is one of the most common mistakes novice programmers make when they write mathematical expressions in Python.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">To perform a division, you must use the slash ( / ) symbol. For example, if you want to divide 10 by 2, you must write 10 / 2.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The integer division operator ( // ) returns the quotient of an integer division, which means that</p>
<div><p>a = 13 // 3</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">assigns a value of 4 to variable a.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The ( // ) operator can be used with floating-point numbers as well. For example, the operation</p>
<div><p>b = 14.4 // 3</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">assigns a value of 4 to variable b.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Correspondingly, the modulus operator ( % ) returns the remainder of an integer division, which means that</p>
<div><p>c = 13 % 3</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">assigns a value of 1 to variable c.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The modulus operator ( % ) can be used with floating-point numbers as well, but the result is a real (float). For example, the operation</p>
<div><p>d = 14.4 % 3</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">assigns a value of 2.4 (and not 2, as you may mistakenly expect) to variable d.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Keep in mind that flowcharts are a loose method used to represent an algorithm. Although the use of the integer quotient ( // ) and the integer remainder ( % ) operators is allowed in flowcharts, this book uses the commonly accepted DIV and MOD operators instead! For example, the Python statements x = 13 // 3 and y = 13 % 3 are represented in a flowchart as</p>
<p class="notice centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width9" src="img/chapter07-04.png"/></p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The exponentiation operator ( ** ) raises the number on the left of the operator to the power of the number on the right. For example, the operation</p>
<div><p>f = 2 ** 3</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">calculates 2 to the power of 3 (2<sup>3</sup>) and assigns a value of 8 to variable f.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The exponentiation operator ( ** ) serves a dual role. Apart from being used to calculate the power of a value raised to another value, it is also used to compute any root of a number using the known mathematical formula <img alt="Image" class="height2" src="img/chapter07-05.png"/>. For example, you can write  y = x ** (1 / 2) to calculate the square root of x or y = x ** (1 / 3) to calculate the cubic root of x.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In mathematics, as you may already know, you are allowed to use parentheses (round brackets) as well as braces (curly brackets) and square brackets , as presented in the following expression.</p>
<p class="notice centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width16" src="img/chapter07-06.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">However, in Python there is no such thing as braces and brackets. Parentheses are all you have; therefore, the same expression must be written using parentheses instead of braces or brackets.</p>
<div><p>y = 5 / 2 * (3 + 2 * (4 + 7 * (6 − 4 / 3)))</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_3">7.3 What is the Precedence of Arithmetic Operators?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Arithmetic operators follow the same precedence rules as in mathematics, and these are: exponentiation is performed first, multiplication and division are performed next, and addition and subtraction are performed last.</p>
<div><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="my_table">
<tbody><tr>
<th class="center" rowspan="4">Higher Precedence<br/><img alt="Image" class="width4" src="img/arrow_up.jpg"/><br/>Lower precedence</th>
<th class="center">Arithmetic Operators</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="center">**</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="center">*, /, //, %</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="center">+, −</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">When multiplication and division exist in the same expression, and since both are of the same precedence, they are performed left to right (the same way as you read), which means that the expression</p>
<div><p>y = 6 / 3 * 2</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">is equivalent to <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter07-07.png"/>, and assigns a value of 4 to variable y, (division is performed before multiplication).</p>
<p class="my_basic">If you want, however, the multiplication to be performed before the division, you can use parentheses to change the precedence. This means that</p>
<div><p>y = 6 / (3 * 2)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">is equivalent to <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter07-08.png"/>, and assigns a value of 1 to variable y (multiplication is performed before division).</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Keep in mind that it is not possible in Python to write fractions in the form of <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter07-09.png"/> or <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter07-10.png"/>. Forget it! There is no equation editor in Visual Studio Code, or in any IDE. All fractions must be written on one single line. For example, <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter07-09.png"/> must be written as 6 / 3, and <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter07-10.png"/> must be written as (4 * x + 5) / 6.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The order of operations can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1)Any operations enclosed in parentheses are performed first.</p>
<p>2)Any exponentiations are performed next.</p>
<p>3)Then, any multiplication and division operations are performed from left to right.</p>
<p>4)In the end, any addition and subtraction operations are performed from left to right.</p>
<p class="my_basic">So, in the next example</p>
<div><p>y = 12 + (20 + 3) - 2 ** 3 / 4 * 3</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">the operations are performed as follows:</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width44" src="img/chapter07-11.png"/></p>
<h3 id="toc_4">7.4 Compound Assignment Operators</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Python offers a special set of operators known as compound assignment operators, which can help you write code faster. These operators are comprehensively detailed in the table below. An example for each operator is provided, while the “Equivalent to” column shows the corresponding statement without using a compound assignment operator.</p>

<p>x)a //= 2</p>
<p>xi)a += 1</p>
<p>xii)a =* 2</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p>i)Correct. It assigns the integer value −10 to variable a.</p>
<p>ii)Wrong. On the left side of the value assignment operator, only variables can exist.</p>
<p>iii)Correct. It increases variable aB by one.</p>
<p>iv)Correct. It assigns the string “COWS” (without the double quotes) to variable a.</p>
<p>v)Correct. It assigns the content of variable COWS to variable a.</p>
<p>vi)Wrong. On the left side of the value assignment operator, only variables (not expressions) can exist.</p>
<p>vii)Wrong. It should have been written as a = 3 * b.</p>
<p>viii)Correct. It assigns the string “True” (without the double quotes) to variable a.</p>
<p>ix)Correct. It assigns the value True to variable a.</p>
<p>x)Correct. This is equivalent to a = a // 2.</p>
<p>xi)Correct. This is equivalent to a = a + 1.</p>
<p>xii)Wrong. It should have been written as a *= 2 (which is equivalent to a = a * 2).</p>

<p>iii)b = "15"</p>
<p>iv)temp = 13.5</p>
<p>v)b = True</p>
<p>vi)b = "True"</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p>i)The value 15 belongs to the set of integers, thus the variable a is an integer.</p>
<p>ii)The value “10 meters” is a text, thus the width variable is a string.</p>
<p>iii)The value “15” is a text, thus the b variable is a string.</p>
<p>iv)The value 13.5 belongs to the set of real numbers, thus the variable temp is real (float).</p>
<p>v)The value True is Boolean, thus the variable b is a Boolean.</p>
<p>vi)The value “True” is a text, thus the variable b is a string.</p>
<h3 id="toc_7">7.5 String Operators</h3>

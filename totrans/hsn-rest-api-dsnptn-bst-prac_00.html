<p class="mce-root">This book is intended to empower you with knowledge of API design principles and best practices, such that you will be ready to design highly scalable, reusable, adaptable, and secured RESTful APIs. This book also introduces some common and some emerging patterns in the most indispensable domain of RESTful APIs.</p>
<p>RESTful patterns impact various layers of web services that span across multiple functions, such as CRUD operations, databases, presentation layers, applications, and infrastructure layers. Other prominent and dominant patterns in the RESTful domain include communication, integration, orchestration, security, management, software deployment, and delivery. This book will help you become familiar with the most significant patterns, such as client/server discovery, API gateways, API compositions, circuit breakers, enterprise security, content negotiation, endpoint redirection, idempotent capability, API façades, and many more essential patterns.</p>
<p>While this book predominantly covers medium-level to advanced-level topics about RESTful APIs, it covers a few basics of service-oriented architectures and resource-oriented web service architectures as well, to help you gain a better understanding of what's being covered more quickly.</p>

Also, this chapter intends to introduce a few practices for better REST API implementations, along with a few common, but avoidable, mistakes of API strategies.</p>
<p><a href="bdb7c23e-8c80-4a89-af31-e40d1b4c1d36.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Essential RESTful API Patterns</em>, provides both information about the concepts and also practical code examples to do with common and fundamental design patterns of RESTful APIs, so that you can better understand and power your RESTful API services. As part of this chapter, you will learn a few common and essential API design patterns, such as content negotiation, URI templates, pagination, Unicode, and more, along with the code implementation of those patterns. Each pattern addresses the RESTful constraints, and helps you to ensure that these essential patterns are accounted for in your API designs and implementations.</p>
<p><a href="c44b2a11-65db-459f-a799-1692dd3930e8.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Advanced RESTful API Patterns</em>, is the second part of our look at API design patterns, and intends to discuss a few advanced design patterns, versioning, backend for frontend, authorization, idempotence and its importance, and how to power APIs and delight customers with bulk operations APIs.</p>
<p><a href="0128a12e-d689-4ac8-a2d6-efbc88e3af82.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Microservice API Gateways</em>, mainly talks about the crucial contributions of API gateway solutions to making microservices vital to producing enterprise-scale, mission-critical, cloud-hosted, event-driven, production-grade, and business-centric applications. We discuss popular API gateway solutions in this chapter and also look at the implementation of an aggregation service through the API gateway.</p>
<p><a href="adb6e30f-4e7f-49d7-bf62-7dddebd4afc5.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>RESTful Services API Testing and Security</em>, intends to take you on an API testing journey, looking at types of API tests, challenges in API testing, and security in API testing. You will get a glimpse of various API testing tools, API security tools, and frameworks, and also learn how you can expose any security issues and API vulnerabilities as part of API testing, quality, and security measures.</p>
<p><a href="c3ee2ccf-330a-4746-bdef-00ec4ed7c8fa.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>RESTful Service Composition for Smart Applications</em>, is specially crafted to tell you all about the contributions of the RESTful services paradigm toward designing, developing, and deploying next-generation microservices-centric and enterprise-scale applications. It looks at how RESTful services that are capable of finding and binding with one another results in process-aware, business-critical, and people-centric composite services. You will understand the need for service composition, various compositions methods such as orchestration and choreography, and also the use of hybrid versions of orchestration and choreography for smarter applications.</p>

- en: In this book, you'll learn about the major tools, techniques, and skills of
    automated testing in the Python 3 language. You'll learn about the tools that
    are included in Python's standard library, such as doctest, unittest, and unittest.mock.
    You'll also learn about useful nonstandard tools such as Nose and coverage.py.
    As we're talking about these tools, we'll also be discussing the philosophy and
    best practices of testing, so when you're done you'll be ready to use what you've
    learned in real-world projects.

    *Daniel Arbuckle*, *Packt Publishing* which only covered Python up to version
    2.6\. Python 3 and its related tools are just slightly too different to justify
    calling this book a second edition. If you''ve read the earlier book and parts
    of this book seem familiar to you, it''s because the two books are in fact similar.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is primarily for people who have a solid grasp of the Python language,
    and want a boost in working with automated testing. If you do not know Python
    at all, this book will still serve as an introduction to automated testing philosophy
    and practices. Thanks to Python's executable pseudocode nature, though, you might
    find the road a little bumpy at times.

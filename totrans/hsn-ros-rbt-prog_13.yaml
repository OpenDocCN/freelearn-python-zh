- en: This section is specifically devoted to artificial intelligence in robotics.
    Building on top of the robot navigation task we covered in the previous section,
    we will learn how to make that behavior adaptive so that the robot is capable
    of learning from the results of its actions in order to improve its performance,
    that is, so that it can achieve the desired goal faster.

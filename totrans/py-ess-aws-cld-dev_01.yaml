    and it has huge advantages. There are multiple cloud providers, such as **Amazon
    Web Services** (**AWS**), **Google Cloud Platform** (**GCP**), and Azure. AWS
    is one of the most widely used cloud providers, and many companies are moving
    there. Cloud usage is significantly growing, and developers are expected to have
    a good understanding of the cloud. By buying this book, you are on the right path
    and stepping into how to implement cool Python applications using AWS.

- en: The cloud is a popular way of using your IT infrastructure and services over
    IT providers that manage machines, networks, and applications. Basically, you
    don’t need any on-premises infrastructure, and cloud providers have their data
    centers to serve the required services over the internet. For example, if you
    need a server, you don’t need to buy a machine and don’t need to set up its network
    and power. Cloud providers serve these resources for you, and you can use them
    over the internet.

    some alarms if the service exceeds your budget.'

    service to implement your application based on your requirements. In this book,
    you will learn to create an AWS account and the required AWS services that allow
    you to run Python applications. To run and deploy the Python application in AWS,
    you will learn how to configure the AWS services and deploy them afterward.

    to learn and has broader usage. Within AWS, most application-related services
    support Python because of its broad usage, and these services are stable when
    it comes to the use of Python. AWS always adapts Python use cases with their services,
    which is a big advantage.

    who want to develop Python applications on AWS as well as learn the concepts of
    appropriate AWS services for implementing Python applications. You should have
    Python knowledge, and this book will focus on creating Python applications in
    AWS. The focus will be on creating and giving details for AWS services instead
    of digging into Python syntax details. Hence, you will add more expertise to your
    skillset.

    just a book of theory and definitions. You will see code examples to illustrate
    what you have learned. I would recommend implementing the same examples by yourself
    to help you learn better and apply the same methodologies to your cloud projects.
    This idea slows down your progress, but you will learn better and easily remember
    the concepts while using AWS in your professional work life.

    you to use different services in the same application and understand the connection

    Please check the costs before deciding to use any AWS service. Please be aware
    that you need to pay for AWS costs while doing the exercises. You can check the

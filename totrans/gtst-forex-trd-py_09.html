<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">According to the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker599"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">general definition of alpha (which </span><a id="_idIndexMarker600"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">you can find, for example, at InvestmentU – </span><a href="https://investmentu.com/what-is-alpha-investing/"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">https://investmentu.com/what-is-alpha-investing/</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">), </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">alpha</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1"> (α) “</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">is a specific measurement of the worth of an investment based on its performance relative to the market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.2">Specifically, alpha measures the ability of an investment to beat </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">market returns.</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Sounds familiar? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Most likely yes if you are interested in markets and trading (otherwise, why would you be reading </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">this book?)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">But is it clear and understandable? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">No, as this </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">definition</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1"> replaces one unknown term (</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">alpha</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">) with another (</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">beat the market</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">, which is often also </span><a id="_idIndexMarker601"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">called </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">edge</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">The article goes on with </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">“Alpha is synonymous with abnormal rate of return.”</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> Why </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">abnormal</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">Because the efficient market theory claims that there is no way to systematically outperform the market, thus any excess return can be considered </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">abnormal</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.2">This makes much more sense, as now we understand that alpha is a metric that compares the return of a strategy, portfolio, or investment to a benchmark (referred</span><a id="_idIndexMarker602"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1"> to as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">broad market</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1"> in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">preceding article).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">In simpler words, there is a benchmark and there’s the return of a trading strategy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">If the latter is greater than the former, then the strategy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">generates alpha.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Simple? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">Yes, but we have to make two </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">important remarks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">First, it is essential to note here that by </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">beating the market</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">, the alpha approach only considers the manipulation of underlying assets, such as selling short, exiting positions and re-entering at different prices, changing the proportion of assets in a portfolio, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">so on.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">Note</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">In other words, generating alpha normally means the active manipulation of the assets themselves, without the use of derivatives or sell-side activities, such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">market making.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Second, there is a problem that is frequently overlooked: we do need that very benchmark against which we’re going to compare the returns of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">trading strategy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">When we talk about investment, the benchmark is obvious: a stock index. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">One of the most popular benchmarks of this kind is the S&amp;P 500 – the index of 500 large-capitalization US companies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">You can buy shares from all these companies and follow the index by holding</span><a id="_idIndexMarker603"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1"> them, for example, for 1 year. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">Alternatively, you can buy only some shares in a proportion other than in the index, buy different shares, sell some shares and replace them with others, or make any other active investment – but when you compare your returns with the return of the index at the end of that very year, and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">if you did better than the index itself by manipulating the market exposure, then you can say that you </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">generated alpha.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Why does this approach make sense in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">equities investing?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">If we look at the entire history of the S&amp;P 500 index, we can immediately see that the US stock markets always grow over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">Yes, there are recessions, and there was even the Great Depression, but in the very long run, if you buy shares from all companies from this index and wait for over 30 years, then you will almost for sure make </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">a profit.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Don’t take my words for granted: check any source for S&amp;P 500 historical data and you will see it yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">The following is a chart by Yahoo! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">Finance in semi-log scale (check it out yourself </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">at </span></span><a href="https://yhoo.it/3U6I5rm"><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">https://yhoo.it/3U6I5rm</span></span></a><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">):</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">With FX trading, it’s more complex and confusing because currencies are not normally used as long-term investment vehicles – at least as widely as equities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">The reason is that currencies feature interest rates, something that makes them radically different from traditional investment assets (see the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Economic news</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1"> section in </span><a href="B19145_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">Chapter 6</span></em></span></a><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">,</span></em> <em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">Basics of Fundamental Analysis and Its Possible Use in FX Trading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">, for a discussion on </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">carry trading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">) and these interest rates change over time based on central banks' decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">So, when you buy and hold a stock, it normally brings you dividends, or in the worst case, you just don’t receive anything if the board decides not to pay dividends this year. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">However, if you buy and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker604"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1"> hold a currency, it’s quite possible that you pay for the luxury of having this currency in your portfolio – if the difference in the interest rates between the two currencies in a pair </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">is negative.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">Using and abusing S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Because of the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker605"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1"> enormous popularity of the S&amp;P 500 index, it is frequently used as a benchmark for everything, not only investing in stocks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">I have even witnessed a comparison of this index to the performance of a high-frequency trading fund. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.3">Of course, this has nothing in common with the traditional meaning of alpha, beta, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">other metrics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">So, it’s clear that we need a benchmark that is adequate for the specifics of the FX market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">What can we use as such a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">benchmark then?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">The simplest benchmark for FX trading strategies could be the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">currency itself.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">Using currency rates as a benchmark</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">We can use</span><a id="_idIndexMarker606"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1"> exactly the same approach as with a stock index: compare the return of the trading strategy to the return in the currency itself for the same given period of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">For example, if we look at the historical rates of EURUSD from January 2021 to January 2022, we can see that they declined from about 1.2240 to about 1.1290, which is down 8%. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">So, if you bought the euro at the beginning of 2021 and held it until the end of the same year, then your "</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">investment"</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1"> would have made about -8% (and in reality, even worse because of the difference in the interest rates). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.2">But if you actively managed your investment by closing long positions and opening short positions when the rates were going down, you would probably have made, say, only -5%. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.3">Technically, you could even say that you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">beat the market</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">, although, from a practical standpoint, such an investment would hardly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">make sense.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">The good news in FX trading is that you can easily buy and sell currencies – quite unlike stocks where selling short a stock that you don’t own (to profit from falling prices) may be problematic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">So, the most reasonable way to generate alpha in FX trading is to change the direction of your positions according to the direction of the market </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">price movements.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">But what to do in case you trade not just one currency pair but a portfolio of currencies? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">Are there benchmarks that could be used to evaluate the alpha in such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">a case?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">Yes, and one of the most acknowledged benchmarks of this kind is the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">US Dollar </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">Index</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1"> (</span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">USDX</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">).</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">Common FX benchmarks – the USDX</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">The USDX (ticker DXY) is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">“a live measure of the performance of the US dollar against a basket of other currencies”</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1"> (see</span><a id="_idIndexMarker607"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1"> Forex.com, </span><a href="https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/what-is-the-dollar-index/"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">https://www.forex.com/en-us/news-and-analysis/what-is-the-dollar-index/</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">If we are to interpret it in terms of investment, then</span><a id="_idIndexMarker608"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1"> it is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker609"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">quite similar to stock investment, but instead of stocks, you buy or sell the US dollar versus a basket of currencies (which at the moment consists of the euro, the British pound, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen, and the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">Swedish krona).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">For example, if the DXY’s value was 100 at the beginning of a year, and at the end of the year, its value was 110, that would equate to a gain of 10%. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">If you had bought dollars for this basket of currencies at the beginning of the year, then you would have had a gain of 10% for your investment – again, in terms of that same basket of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">foreign currencies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">The USDX is useful for the evaluation of FX trading strategies and portfolios because it’s already cleared of the interest rates and we may say that it presents the potential alpha in the FX market in its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">purest form.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">If we look at the historical values of the USDX in the following chart, we can see that quite unlike the S&amp;P 500, it cannot be used as a long-term investment – the same as is the case with any </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">single currency:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">Overall, currency rates do not tend to grow over time perpetually. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">That’s why using their rates for a single currency or a basket of currencies as a benchmark does not make as much sense as using a stock index as a benchmark </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">for investing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Let’s summarize</span><a id="_idIndexMarker617"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1"> all of this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">In the world of FX trading, by generating alpha, we assume that we will outperform any of the relevant FX indices – including the buy-and-hold return for a single currency – by actively manipulating the currencies in a portfolio. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">In this sense almost all </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">buy-side</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1"> strategies fall into this category (see </span><a href="B19145_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">Chapter 1</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">Developing Trading Strategies – Why They Are Different</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">, to refresh your memory on buy-side and sell-side market participants). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">This is the very kind of strategy we’re going to consider further in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">this book.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Key takeaway</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">In the simplest terms, by alpha in FX trading, we mean making profits when the price goes anywhere, up or down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">So, for alpha-generating strategies, the worst market is the one where the price doesn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">move sufficiently.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">But is this really a problem? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">Do these markets exist – those where prices don’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">change substantially?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">Of course they do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">Any FX market may become more or less volatile, mostly thanks to changes in liquidity and sometimes special conditions imposed by central banks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.3">For example, let’s look at the chart of the euro versus the Swiss franc from April to September 2012, the time when</span><a id="_idIndexMarker618"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1"> the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">Swiss National Bank</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">SNB</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">) decided to artificially peg</span><a id="_idIndexMarker619"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1"> the rate of the Swiss franc to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">the euro:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">The concept of beta also originates in stock investment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.2">It refers to the volatility of the returns achieved </span><a id="_idIndexMarker621"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">by the portfolio – and as in the case with alpha, again, versus a benchmark. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">Sure, in the case of stock trading, this is also usually a stock index, with the S&amp;P 500 again being the most </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">common example.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">We already discussed market volatility in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">Volatility indicators</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1"> section of </span><a href="B19145_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor114"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">Chapter 7</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">Technical Analysis and Its Implementation in Python</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">The volatility of returns from an investment or a trading strategy can be studied in a more or less similar way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.3">In investment and trading, beta is a measure of the risk of how much you can potentially afford to lose in order to achieve the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">expected profit.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">To better understand the volatility of returns, let’s consider the example of traveling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">Say, you want to get from London to New York. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">The most straightforward way to get from the starting point to your target is to take a direct plane. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.4">This route will be our benchmark. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.5">You can also enjoy a two-week trip by sea, which will be much slower and less straightforward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.6">Otherwise, you can travel by car to France, then by train and bus to Norway, then by ship to Iceland, then by plane to Canada, and from there to New York by car, train, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">or bus.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">See the difference? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">In all three cases, you get from the starting point to your target, but the volatility of your path will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">differ dramatically.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">It’s the same with returns: let’s chart the hypothetical returns for two trading strategies (or investment portfolios, it doesn’t matter) over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">One of them would be less volatile and the other one </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">more so:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">An </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">option</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1"> is a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker624"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1"> derivative (see </span><a href="B19145_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">Chapter 1</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Developing Trading Strategies – Why They Are Different</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">, for a brief explanation of the underlying and derivatives) that gives its holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a certain price in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">the future.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">I know that it’s really hard to understand at first, so let’s consider an example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">Say, it’s October and a kilo of apples costs $1 at the moment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.3">I think that its price will grow to $2 by December, but another market participant thinks that even if it grows, it won’t exceed $1.5. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.4">So, this market participant writes an option to buy apples at $1.5 in December and sells this option to me for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">a premium.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">Now, if I am wrong and a kilo of apples in December indeed costs less than $1.5, then I will lose the amount of money I paid to my counterparty as the premium and the counterparty will make a profit (this very premium), but if I am right and a kilo of apples costs $2 or higher, then I realize my right to buy apples at $1.5 and immediately sell them at $2, thus making a profit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">And this profit is obviously covered by my counterparty who sold me such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">a right.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">As you can see, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">the option writer earns purely on volatility</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">: for them, it really doesn’t matter where the price goes; they earn if the volatility doesn’t exceed a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">certain level.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Can you see the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">problem here?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">For option sellers or writers, the profit is always fixed and equal to the premium, but the potential loss is unlimited. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">In our example, what if apples traded at $20 rather than $2? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">Such an unexpected and sharp growth in price could hurt the option </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">writer significantly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">To illustrate how it is possible to earn selling options, let’s go back to the example of EURCHF from the previous section. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">If a market trades in a narrow range, it is possible to write options to buy above this range (they are </span><a id="_idIndexMarker625"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">call options</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">) and options to sell below this range (they</span><a id="_idIndexMarker626"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1"> are called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">put options</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">) and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker627"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">collect a premium, which works as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">stable income.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">But we all know that there’s no trade without risk, and if the market suddenly goes outside of the range (and quite frankly, it’s not a matter of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">if</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1"> but of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">when</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">), option writers may suffer from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">severe losses.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">Let’s see how it actually happened with that same EURCHF. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">The SNB maintained the rate of the franc pegged to the euro and this caused this market trade within a narrow range, as we saw previously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">But one day – on January 15, 2015 – SNB decided to unpeg the franc from the euro. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.4">As the result, EURCHF plunged by over 20 figures (a figure is 100 pips) or almost 20% in a moment, and option writers who sold put options (and a put option is the right to sell at a certain price) suffered from unbelievable losses because there was no opportunity to liquidate their massively losing positions. </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">Figure 9</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">.6</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1"> illustrates this price jump (or, rather, an asteroid downfall) and you can see how volatility exceeded any imaginable and believable limits in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">few minutes:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">Let’s quickly recap</span><a id="_idIndexMarker630"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1"> the idea of generating alpha: we want to beat the market or perform better than an index (or just the rate itself in FX trading) by actively managing the position in the market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.2">This means we try to buy when we expect the price to go up and we try to sell when we expect the price to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">go down.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">Therefore, in order to successfully generate alpha, we basically have only two options: either we suppose that the price will continue moving in an already established direction, or we anticipate a change. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.2">In the former case, we make an attempt to buy when prices go higher and sell when they go down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.3">In the latter case, we try to buy when prices go down and sell when they </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">go up.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">Funnily enough, a trend in trading is one of those terms that does not have a strict formal definition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">Some authors define a trend as a sequence of higher highs and higher lows or vice versa – lower highs and lower lows in the market price, but such a definition is ambiguous because it misses the volatility (see the example about traveling from London to New York in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">Beta – earn from volatility</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1"> section). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.2">We can say that the market is in trend if the following applies for a given period </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">of time:</span></span></p>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">The market has low beta – that is, the volatility is less than the change </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">in prices</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">The observed time interval is substantial: its duration is several orders of magnitude greater than the duration of a single sample (for example, if the data resolution is 1 day, then we can consider a trend on a timespan of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">50-200 days)</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">This figure clearly </span><a id="_idIndexMarker635"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">shows </span><a id="_idIndexMarker636"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">the inconsistency of the classical definition of a trend (higher highs and higher lows or lower highs and lower lows). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.2">In both charts, there is a certain downward trend in the price. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.3">In both charts, we can see a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.4">However, considering beta makes it clear that the left-hand chart represents a non-trending market and the right one depicts a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">trending market.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">If we calculate the volatility as standard deviation and plot it above and below the regression line in the middle, we can see that the width of the resulting regression channel is greater in the left chart while the price itself has a greater absolute value of change in the right chart. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.2">To simplify the analysis, we added an indicator below each chart that plots the maximum value of the standard deviation for the period in consideration – thus, the line represents the latest actual value of volatility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.3">You can see that in the right-hand chart, the alpha is greater and the beta is lower than in the left one, so we can say that according to our definition, the right chart represents a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">true trend.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">Mean reversion</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">The idea behind</span><a id="_idIndexMarker639"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1"> this type of trading strategy was originally born </span><a id="_idIndexMarker640"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">again in stock trading. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.2">Despite the fact that in the long term, markets always tends to grow, in the shorter term, we can always see rises and falls in the market price. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.3">Therefore, we can assume that there is a certain mean price that grows over time and consider deviations as temporary, so the price will eventually go back to that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">mean value.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">From this standpoint, even the Great Depression was only a deviation, and indeed, if you were bold enough to buy US stocks in the 1930s and lived long enough to hold them until 1950, then you could have easily doubled or tripled your fortune, at least its notional value (if you didn't consider inflation, then you may be quite surprised to discover that you cannot buy three times as many goods with your tripled amount </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">of money).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">The point in </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">mean reversion</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1"> is thus the observed time interval. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">If we consider a short time span, say, 1 year or less, we can</span><a id="_idIndexMarker641"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1"> see any type of market effects there: trending up (or a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">bullish market</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">), ranges, flattening, or trending down (or a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">bearish market</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">However, from</span><a id="_idIndexMarker642"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1"> a long-term perspective, it appears that almost all bearish markets are only temporary pullbacks from a hypothetical mean value that is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">constantly growing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">As we already know, currency markets do not exhibit the same long-term upside bias as stock markets, so it’s impossible to just buy every significant pullback and be on the positive side in 10-20 years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.2">Instead, we have an advantage: we can buy and sell any currency versus any other equally easily. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.3">Therefore, the concept of mean reversion in currency markets is slightly different: if we can identify the current price as being too far from the theoretical mean value, then we enter the market in the direction toward this mean, that is, opposite to the current direction of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">price movement.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">Mean reversion is also frequently</span><a id="_idIndexMarker643"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1"> referred to as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">counter-trend trading</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1"> (or, to be more precise, counter-trend trading is a variation of mean reversion) because with counter-trend trading, we don’t just buy or sell and then hold the position for a long time, but rather enter the market for a relatively short time against the direction of the main price movement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">The following figure illustrates possible counter-trend trades placed inside</span><a id="_idIndexMarker644"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1"> quite</span><a id="_idIndexMarker645"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1"> an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">established trend:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">You may ask: why place counter-trend trades if we could just buy GBPJPY in September 2020 and sell in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">May 2021?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">There are two serious reasons </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">for that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">First, trends in the currency markets are quite infrequent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.2">A trend-following strategy may place only 4-6 trades in 3 years, and there’s no guarantee that all of them will be profitable (as with any </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">systematic trades).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">Second, the longer we stay in a position, the greater risk that the market will eventually go against us. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.2">Besides that, the volatility of returns from a trend-following position (beta of returns) will be high because it will replicate the volatility of the market itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.3">So, placing multiple counter-trend trades that stay in the market for a considerably shorter period could possibly improve the beta of the overall </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">strategy performance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">Currency markets</span><a id="_idIndexMarker646"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1"> also have quite an interesting feature: the shorter </span><a id="_idIndexMarker647"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">the timeframe, the more mean-reverting the market. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.2">Using daily data, it is possible to find really long-term trends, although not many. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.3">If you consider sampling market data at 4-hour intervals (you can refresh your memory about market data sampling in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">Data compression – keep the amounts to the reasonable minimum</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1"> section in </span><a href="B19145_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor086"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">Chapter 5</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">Retrieving and Handling Market Data with Python</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">), it will already become problematic to identify tradable trends: methods that work on daily data will yield a lot of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">false</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1"> trends. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">And if you go down in data compression to 1 hour, 1 minute, or less, you will see that the proportion of duration of trending to non-trending market phases will degrade so much that mean reversion becomes almost the only trading technique that can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">successfully used.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">Why does it happen </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">this way?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">One of the key factors that destroys trend-following in shorter timeframes in currency markets is that all of them exhibit strong intraday periodicity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.2">This periodicity is explained by the nature of this market: it is open 24 hours, 5 days a week, but the activity of market participants is quite different during different hours of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">the day.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">Midday (from here on assuming we are in the GMT time zone) features greater liquidity and greater trading volume, and equally, important economic news is released during London and New York work hours. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.2">Night always has lower liquidity and lower trading volumes, and there is no important economic news, with the exception of the Asia Pacific region. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.3">So, intraday price volatility inevitably exhibits strong periodicity, thus making identifying tradable intraday trends quite problematic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.4">In </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">Figure 9</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">.9</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">, you can see one of the simplest representations of volatility (just the range of each bar, that is, the difference between the bar’s high and low) and it’s clear that intraday periodicity is really strong in</span><a id="_idIndexMarker648"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1"> the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker649"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">FX markets:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">The idea behind the breakout is based on the assumption that periods when market is trading in a narrow range and periods when it bursts into sharp price movements interleave with one another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.2">In the language of volatility, this means that low-volatility periods eventually turn into periods of high volatility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.3">Thus, the breakout market model assumes that the price movements consist only of these two phases: low and high volatility, and if we can identify the former, then we can possibly enter the market as soon as it leaves its "</span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">comfort zone"</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1"> and join the freshly establishing price movement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">With breakout trading, we don’t care about trends, mean reversion, or any other factors; we focus only on the relatively short-term process of changing the volatility from low </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">to high.</span></span></p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">Arbitrage</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1"> in financial markets</span><a id="_idIndexMarker659"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1"> means taking advantage of situations when the same asset is priced differently at different trading venues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.2">Such a situation is usually called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1">mispricing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1"> (there </span><a id="_idIndexMarker660"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">are other meanings of this term, and we will get back to it in the very next section about statistical arbitrage). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.2">Due to the colossal fragmentation of the FX market (see </span><a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">FX Market Overview from a Developer’s Standpoint</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">) mispricing there is not infrequent, so an arbitrage strategy looks pretty straightforward: as soon as we see that, say, EURUSD is priced at 1.00012 at LMAX and 1.00013 at IS Prime, then we simultaneously buy at LMAX and sell at IS Prime, pocketing one-tenth of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">a pip.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">I think you can clearly see some problems with arbitrage, which directly follow from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">its description.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">First, the potential profit from a single trade is ridiculously small, so you have to make lots of trades in order to be consistently profitable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">And don’t forget about trading costs: commissions, trading server maintenance fees, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.3">Your trade should cover them all; otherwise, you will only achieve what traders refer </span><a id="_idIndexMarker661"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">to as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">paper profit</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">The second (and main problem) with classical arbitrage is the number of arbitrageurs – they act so quickly that the price may change before your order is executed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.2">Then, you have two options: either wait in hope that the price returns to a level where trade is profitable or liquidate your position with a loss. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.3">In this sense, the type of risk in arbitrage is somewhat similar to that of market making (see the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">Market makers – comfortable, sophisticated, expensive</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1"> section </span><a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">FX Market Overview from a Developer’s Standpoint</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">) although the former is an alpha-generating buy-side trading activity, and the latter is a beta-earning sell-side </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">trading activity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">FX markets also feature a unique form of arbitrage, which is</span><a id="_idIndexMarker662"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1"> called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">triangle arbitrage</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.2">This kind of arbitrage exists only because we don’t buy and sell assets for currency, but trade currencies against each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.3">So, we can search for opportunities for mispricing in so-called synthetic currency pairs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.4">Let’s consider </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">an example.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">Let’s suppose that the EURUSD is traded at 0.99745. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.2">At the same time, the USDJPY is traded at 146.336. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.3">If we calculate the rate of the euro versus the Japanese yen using these two rates, we will get the rate of EURJPY at 145.963, but when we look at the real market, we find that the actual rate of EURJPY at a particular trading venue is 145.972. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.4">The difference between the real currency pair (EURJPY) and our synthetically calculated rate is 0.9 pips. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.5">So, we immediately sell USDJPY (thus, we have JPY and have sold USD) and EURUSD (thus we have USD and have sold EUR), which efficiently creates a short position in EURJPY. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.6">At the same time, we buy EURJPY, from where it’s traded at a mispriced rate and makes a profit of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">0.9 pips.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">Of course, triangle arbitrage is prone to the same diseases as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">plain</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1"> arbitrage: speed is crucial, and potential losses are always much greater than potential profits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.2">Therefore, normally, arbitrage </span><a id="_idIndexMarker663"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">is the realm of financial institutions, and we have considered it here briefly only so that you knew how it works (and let me repeat again, who knows where you will find yourself working </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">next year?)</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">Statistical arbitrage</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">As we saw in the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker664"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1"> previous section, arbitrage is based on the idea of mispricing: a situation in which an asset is priced incorrectly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.2">But to say whether something is priced incorrectly or correctly, we need a reference that is known to be priced correctly, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">don’t we?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">In classical arbitrage, such a reference is the asset price itself, and we take advantage of mispricing across different trading venues trading the same asset. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1">Statistical arbitrage</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.1">stat arb</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.1">) uses the concept of fair value to determine whether the asset is mispriced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.2">In simple terms, with classical arbitrage, we compare the price of the asset versus another price of the asset that exists at the same moment in time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.3">With stat arb, we compare the price of the asset to a theoretical fair value to which we expect the price to revert in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">the future.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">In a certain sense, stat arb is a modification or extension of the concept of mean reversion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.2">Indeed, a successful mean reversion strategy is based on the statistical analysis of various price-volume-volatility setups, with the assumption that if the price is too far from a certain mean value, then it will return to it sooner or later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.3">Stat arb replaces the mean value with a fair value, which can be derived from multiple factors, from money flows to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">political situations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1">One of the most popular applications of stat </span><a id="_idIndexMarker665"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">arb is </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">derivatives trading</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.2">We already quickly mentioned derivatives in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">Trade mechanics – again some terminology</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1"> section of </span><a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">FX Market Overview from a Developer’s Standpoint</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.2">Let’s get a bit deeper into this complex yet very </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">interesting domain.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">In simple terms, a derivative is a financial instrument that gives its owner either a right to buy or sell an asset or the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a certain price on a certain date. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.2">Note these two mandatory attributes of a derivate: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">at a certain price on a certain date</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.2">This makes derivatives priced differently from the asset (which is called the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">underlying</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">) – because</span><a id="_idIndexMarker666"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1"> they all have</span><a id="_idIndexMarker667"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1"> an </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">expiration</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">, a date on which the final settlement should </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">be made.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">It indeed sounds </span><a id="_idIndexMarker668"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">sophisticated if you’re not familiar with derivatives, but in fact, it’s quite simple. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.2">Let’s consider </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1">an example.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1">Suppose that today is January 1 and the current price of EURUSD is 1.00000. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.2">I think that the price will grow by the third Friday of March to 1.02000. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.3">You think that it will not exceed 1.01000. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.4">So, you</span><a id="_idIndexMarker669"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1"> sell a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">future contract</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">, which is an obligation to sell the euro at 1.01000, and I buy this contract, which for me, means an obligation to buy the euro from you on the same date – the third Friday of March. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.2">This date is called the expiration date of the future contract, and the process of mutual buying and selling on expiration is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker670"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">called </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">settlement</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.1">I think it’s clear what may happen with our positions on the expiration date. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.2">If I am right and the price of the euro has indeed raised to 1.02000, then I buy the euro from you at 1.01000 and immediately sell at 1.02000, which means I made a profit of 100 pips. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.3">Subsequently, you have to sell the euro to me at 1.01000, and given its market price is now 1.02000, you suffer a loss of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.1">100 pips.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">The expiration date significantly affects the price of the future contract. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.2">Typically, the more distant the expiration date, the greater the difference in the price of the respective future contract compared to today’s price, or the spot price. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.3">The following figure illustrates </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">this difference:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1">However unlike classical arbitrage, stat arb is surely available to any trader (with sufficient funding to afford to have dozens of concurrently open positions), so if you are interested in learning more about it, I’d recommend starting with some mathematics, namely, learning about correlation (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">) and cointegration (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">), and then reading a short but quite informative article by Sabir Jana, CFA (</span><a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/statistical-arbitrage-with-pairs-trading-and-backtesting-ec657b25a368"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/statistical-arbitrage-with-pairs-trading-and-backtesting-ec657b25a368</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">), in which the author explains the basics of building a stat arb setup using stocks – but the same approach can be applied to currencies and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">their derivatives.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">So far, we have considered alpha-generating strategies that base their entries on various setups in terms of price, volume, and volatility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.2">However, there is a class of strategies that do not consider </span><a id="_idIndexMarker672"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">this market information at all, or at least partly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.2">These are event-driven strategies – and don’t confuse them with the event-driven architecture </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">of applications!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">The problem with strategies of this kind was also considered in detail in the same chapter: due to insufficient liquidity around the time of a news release, the price may jump in virtually any direction at an arbitrary distance, so you have no chance to place a trade at the desired price. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.2">At the same time, the return of liquidity may drive the price in the opposite direction, completely eliminating the potential for a profit in a few minutes (see </span><a href="B19145_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1">Chapter 6</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1"> again for an example with the British pound and the release of the UK’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1">GDP figures).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.1">I can confirm that profitable news traders used to exist in the early 2000s, but it has been really hard to make this trading consistent after 2010. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.2">So, we are not going to use non-price information in our strategies for any purpose other than, probably, stopping the execution of the strategy before potentially </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.1">high-impact news.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">This is no surprise that market making requires not only direct access to the order book, with the ability to update the best bid and ask there, but also assumes that you are able to send your own bids and asks and match client orders faster than others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.2">In this way, we are entering the realm of low-latency and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">high-frequency </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">trading</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1"> (</span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1">HFT</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1">).</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">High frequency, low latency – where Python fails</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">Our overview would </span><a id="_idIndexMarker677"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">be incomplete without mentioning HFT. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.2">Its roots are in the financial crisis of 2008 when liquidity became the main issue in most, if not all, developed markets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.3">Exchanges started to offer an incentive to those who provided liquidity, waiving many restrictions that previously required liquidity providers to be regulated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.4">As a result, many market participants started to offer liquidity, or, rather, demonstrated this liquidity in the order book – because they sent an order only to withdraw it from the book some milliseconds later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.5">In other words, they started to bluff creating an illusion </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">of liquidity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">Of course, to be successful here, you need to be able to process thousands of transactions per second and reduce the latency (that is, the time between the order is sent to the exchange and the time it appears in the order book) to the absolute minimum. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.2">That’s why HFT requires very expensive computers located at very expensive data centers as close to the exchange servers </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">as possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1">HFT was heavily criticized, especially after two events </span><a id="_idIndexMarker678"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1">known as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">flash crashes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1">: situations in which the price drops a significant amount (over 10%) without any visible reason. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.2">It is quite possible that if an HFT trader sent a large order, then a buy-side market participant decided to trade against this order, and the HFT trader withdrew the order a fraction of a millisecond before the trade, then the buy-side order would swipe the order book, moving the price to levels that, of course, were neither expected nor desirable (see the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1">Exchange and order book</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1"> section in </span><a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1">, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1">FX Market Overview from a </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">Developer’s Standpoint</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">So, it’s clear that HFT is a domain in which Python will fail because of its speed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.2">Most HFT algos are written in C++ or sometimes in C, with the most critical parts sometimes in Assembler. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.3">It’s worth mentioning again that compilers such as Numba or Cython may dramatically increase the speed of Python code; however, they cannot achieve the speed of compiled C or C++ code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.4">Besides that, all Python-based solutions have very limited support for FPGAs, so sometimes professional algo traders say that Python is suitable only for </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">slow HFT</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1"> algorithms (which work in milliseconds </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1">not microseconds).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">With all these</span><a id="_idIndexMarker679"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1"> considerations in mind, there’s no wonder that we are not going to consider HFT trading strategies in this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.2">Just be aware when you see a nice order in the order book, you cannot always grasp it for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">your profit!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">In this chapter, we learned about the key terms and concepts of systematic and algo trading. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.2">We familiarized ourselves with alpha and beta as risk metrics in investment and at the same time, as different methods for profit generation in algo trading. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.3">We considered a few popular alpha-generating trading strategies and learned about their advantages, shortcomings, and associated risks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.4">We also touched on the complex domain of options trading as the primary method to earn on market beta and gave a quick look at other trading strategies, such as arbitrage and stat arb, market-making, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">and HFT.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">Now that we know the conditions under which a certain strategy may enter or exit the market, the last obstacle on our way to a first trading application is the mechanism that generates orders according to the strategy rules, sends them to the market, and controls their execution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.2">Recalling the analogy at the beginning of this chapter, now we have added the brains to our trading app, and it’s time to add the limbs with which it will be able to move. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.3">This is what we are going to develop in the very </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">next chapter.</span></span></p>

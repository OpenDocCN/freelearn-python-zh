- en: Like many other developers, Python developers have always had to find ways to
    manage the development workflow between different tools. Most of the time, this
    happens without using a comprehensive guide that is available in a complete IDE
    which is specifically designed for Python development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rare, exceptional IDEs that offer complete guides are often expensive and
    don't provide hands-on steps to help speed up the development process.

- en: Visual Studio, as a matured and well-developed tool over the last few decades,
    has dominated the market of compiled languages and languages that are strictly
    oriented toward Windows and .NET. Packed with handy tools and functionalities
    to speed up and facilitate the workflow of developers, it helps users to render
    repetitive tasks, manage projects, and provide a detailed outlook into the structure
    of a project. However, most importantly, it helps users gain a clear view into
    the inner structure of the code.

- en: In the last few years, Microsoft has started exploring how to integrate new
    languages into Visual Studio; as a result, Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS)
    was developed. It's a well-developed tool that is already on its second release
    and is commonly used by professional developers as their new IDE of choice for
    Python projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'PTVS has everything that a Python developer can dream of: consistent project
    files management, interactive debugging and code completion features with the
    rock solid Microsoft IntelliSense technology, project templates, a first-class
    Django integration package, virtual environment management right in the IDE for
    REPL, and a native code-based IDE that loads and reacts fast.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will focus more on the integration of Python in Visual Studio than
    the language itself. It will try to delve into the power offered by the tool and
    venture into the feasibility of its day-to-day usage for a developer. We will
    show real examples of how to use PTVS with Django and how to deal with occasional
    difficulties when it comes to integrating well-known libraries into a Python project
    on Microsoft Windows.

    Steve Dower, who has contributed to the book personally and through providing
    technical support on every detail. Thanks to Shahrokh Mortazavi for reaching out
    to us through a tweet ([https://twitter.com/cathycracks/status/421336498748006400](https://twitter.com/cathycracks/status/421336498748006400)).
    Steve and the rest of the team have given us lots of help, insights, and suggestions
    on how to overcome some complex but very important parts of the book. They even
    invited us to visit them in person to gain a greater insight into their work.
    We truly feel that PTVS is developed by a group of passionate people who care
    for the community and are eager to develop PTVS to be an even better and useful
    tool. The Microsoft PTVS team has done a great job with the tool so far in our
    opinion, and we look forward to what's yet to come.

    needed for a test to run. Essentially, fixtures are functions that help in managing
    and providing consistent resources, such as data, configuration, or objects, to
    different test cases within a test suite. Fixtures enable you to establish a stable
    and controlled environment for testing.

    duplicating setup and teardown methods across multiple tests. You are probably
    wondering what setup and teardown methods are. Let’s pause for a minute and shed
    more light on this duo in testing Flask applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In unit testing, the concepts of setup and teardown methods are pivotal techniques
    that are used to prepare and clean up the testing environment before and after
    the execution of each test case. Before delving into test cases, the setup procedure
    comes into play. The setup method is executed before each test case, and its purpose
    is to establish the required conditions for testing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, let’s consider a Flask unit test scenario; the setup method could
    be designed to mimic a Flask application instance and configure a testing client,
    thereby providing the necessary infrastructure to simulate HTTP requests and responses
    for testing purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the flip side, there is the teardown phase. The teardown procedure takes
    place post-execution of every test case and involves cleaning up resources that
    were initially established during the setup operation. Back to the Flask unit
    test illustration, the teardown method might be programmed to gracefully terminate
    the testing client and shut down the Flask application instance. This ensures
    that no lingering resources remain active that can disrupt subsequent tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This duo of setup and teardown is typically located within the confines of
    a class encapsulating the suite of test cases. To understand it better, consider
    the following code snippet, which illustrates a class incorporating setup and
    teardown methods to validate a Flask application:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE6]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In the preceding code, the setup method creates a Flask application instance
    and a test client. On the other hand, the teardown method gracefully concludes
    the test client and disposes of the Flask application instance. The outcome is
    a neat and orderly closure of resources once a test concludes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, in pytest, the setup and teardown paradigms can be emulated using fixtures.
    Fixtures serve as functions designated to furnish shared resources to multiple
    test cases. Fixtures allow you to define and manage test dependencies. This is
    how fixtures work in pytest. You define a fixture with the `@pytest.fixture` decorator.
    This function can then be used as a parameter in test functions, which allows
    the test function to access the fixture’s data or environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a test function is run, pytest automatically detects any fixtures that
    are defined as parameters and runs those fixture functions first, passing their
    return values as arguments to the test function. This ensures that the test function
    has access to the data or environment it needs to run correctly.

    a Flask application instance and a test client:'

    instance and the client fixture creates a test client. These fixtures can then
    be used by test cases within the test suite to get access to the Flask application
    and the test client.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    teardown is their potential for reusability. By using fixtures, the setup and
    teardown logic can be efficiently shared across multiple test cases. This will

    enhance the reusability of test cases.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Mocking external dependencies** is a testing technique that involves creating
    simulated versions of external dependencies, such as APIs or databases, to isolate
    your code under test from these dependencies. When you’re writing unit tests,
    you typically want to test only the code within the scope of the test, not any
    external services or libraries that it relies on.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    positives or false negatives that can result from relying on external dependencies
    that may not be available or may behave unpredictably.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create a mock object, you must use a mocking framework, such as `unittest.mock`
    or `pytest-mock`, to create a fake object that mimics the behavior of the real
    object. You can then use this mocked object in your tests instead of the real
    object, which allows you to test your code in a controlled environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For instance, let’s say you are testing a function that retrieves data from
    an external API. You can use a mocking framework to create a mock object that
    mimics the behavior of the API, and then use this mocked object in your tests
    instead of making actual API calls. This allows you to test your function’s behavior
    in a controlled environment, without you having to worry about network connectivity
    or the behavior of the external API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using a mocking strategy in your tests can also help you write more comprehensive
    tests as it allows you to simulate error conditions or edge cases that might be
    difficult or impossible to replicate with a real external dependency. For example,
    you can use a mocked object to simulate a network timeout or a database error,
    and then verify that your code under test handles these conditions correctly.

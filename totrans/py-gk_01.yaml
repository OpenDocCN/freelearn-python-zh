- en: We start our journey by exploring different ways of using Python optimally,
    from both the design and the implementation points of view. We provide a deeper
    understanding of the life cycle of a large-scale Python project and its phases.
    Once we have that understanding, we investigate different ways of creating an
    elegant design by modularizing a Python project. Wherever necessary, we look under
    the hood to understand the internal workings of Python. This is followed by a
    deep dive into object-oriented programming in Python.

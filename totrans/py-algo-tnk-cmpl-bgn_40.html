<h3 id="toc_1">28.1 Introduction</h3>
<p class="my_basic">This chapter is dedicated to teaching you some useful tips and tricks that can help you write “better” code. You should always keep them in mind when you design your own algorithms, or even your own Python programs.</p>
<p class="my_basic">These tips and tricks can help you increase your code's readability, help you choose which loop control structure is better to use in each given problem, and help make the code shorter or even faster. Of course there is no single perfect method because on one occasion the use of a specific tip or trick may help, but on another occasion the same tip or trick may have exactly the opposite result. Most of the time, code optimization is a matter of programming experience.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Smaller algorithms are not always the best solution to a given problem. In order to solve a specific problem, you might write a concise algorithm that unfortunately proves to consume a significant amount of CPU time and/or a large portion of main memory (RAM). On the other hand, you might solve the same problem with another algorithm that appears longer but calculates the result much faster and/or utilizes less RAM.</p>

<h3 id="toc_2">28.2 Choosing a Loop Control Structure</h3>
<p class="my_basic">The following diagram can help you choose the most appropriate loop control structure to use in each given problem, depending on the number of iterations.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width32" src="img/chapter28-01.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>This diagram recommends the best option, not the only option. For example, when the number of iterations is known, it is not wrong to use a pre-test or a post-test loop structure instead. The proposed for-loop, though, is more convenient.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_3">28.3 The “Ultimate” Rule</h3>
<p class="my_basic">One question that often preys on programmers' minds when using pre-test or post-test loop structures, is how to determine which statements should be written inside, and which outside, the loop control structure and in which order.</p>
<p class="my_basic">There is one simple yet powerful rule—the “Ultimate” rule! Once you follow it, the potential for making a logic error is reduced to zero!</p>
<p class="my_basic">The “Ultimate” rule states:</p>
<p>►The variable or variables that participate in a loop's Boolean expression must be initialized before entering the loop.</p>
<p>►The value of the variable or variables that participate in a loop's Boolean expression must be updated (altered) within the loop. And more specifically, the statement that does this update/alteration must be one of the last statements of the loop.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For example, if variable x is the variable that participates in a loop's Boolean expression, a pre-test loop structure should be in the following form,</p>
<div><p>Initialize x</p>
<p>while Boolean_Expression(x):</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements</p></div>
<div><p>Update/alter x</p></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">and a post-test loop structure should be in the following form,</p>
<div><p>Initialize x</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements</p></div>
<div><p>Update/alter x</p></div>
<p>if Boolean_Expression(x): break</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►Initialize x is any statement that assigns an initial value to variable x. It can be either an input statement such as input("Enter a number: "), or an assignment statement using the value assignment operator ( = ). In a post-test loop structure though, this statement may sometimes be redundant and can be omitted since initialization of x can occur directly inside the loop.</p>
<p>►Boolean_Expression(x) can be any Boolean expression from a simple to a complex one, dependent on variable x.</p>
<p>►Update/alter x is any statement that alters the value of x, such as another input statement, an assignment statement using the value assignment operator ( = ), or even compound assignment operators. It is important that this statement must be positioned just before the point where the loop's Boolean expression is evaluated. This means it should be one of the last statements within the loop.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Following are some examples that use the “Ultimate” rule.</p>
<p class="strong">Example 1</p>
<div><p>a = int(input())  #Initialization of a</p>
<p>while a &gt; 0:  #Boolean expression dependent on a</p>
<p>print(a)</p>
<p>a = a – 1  #Update/alteration of a</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Example 2</p>
<div><p>a = int(input())  #Initialization of a</p>
<p>b = int(input())  #Initialization of b</p>
<p>while a &gt; b:  #Boolean expression dependent on a and b</p>
<p>print(a, b)</p>
<p>a = int(input())  #Update/alteration of a</p>
<p>b = int(input())  #Update/alteration of b</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Example 3</p>
<div><p>s = 0  #Initialization of s</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<p>y = int(input())</p>
<p>s = s + y  #Update/alteration of s</p>
<p>if s &gt;= 1000: break  #Boolean expression dependent on s</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Example 4</p>
<div><p>y = 0  #Initialization of y</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<p>y = int(input())  #Update/alteration of y</p>
<p>if y &gt;= 0: break  #Boolean expression dependent on y</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In this example, though, initialization of variable y outside the loop is redundant and can be omitted, as shown here.</p>
<div><p>while True:</p>
<p>y = int(input())  #Initialization and update/alteration of y</p>
<p>if y &gt;= 0: break  #Boolean expression dependent on y</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Example 5</p>
<div><p>odd = 0   #Initialization of odd</p>
<p>even = 0  #Initialization of even</p>
<p>while odd + even &lt; 5:  #Boolean expression dependent on odd and even</p>
<p>x = int(input())</p>
<p>if x % 2 == 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>even += 1  #Update/alteration of even</p></blockquote></div>
<p>else:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>odd += 1   #Update/alteration of odd</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>print("Odds:", odd, "Evens:", even)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, you will realize why you should always follow the “Ultimate” rule”! Let's take a look at the following exercise:</p>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a code fragment that lets the user enter numbers repeatedly until three positive numbers are entered in total.</p>
<p class="my_basic">This exercise was given to a class, and a student gave the following code fragment as an answer.</p>
<div><p>positivesCount = 0</p>
<div></div>
<p>x = float(input())</p>
<p>while positivesCount != 3:</p>
<p>if x &gt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>positivesCount += 1</p></blockquote></div>
<p>x = float(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>print("Three positives provided!")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">At first glance it appears to be correct. It lets the user enter a number, enters the loop, checks whether the user-provided number is positive or not, then lets the user enter a second number, and so on. However, this code contains a logic error—and unfortunately, it's a tricky one. Can you spot it?</p>
<p class="my_basic">Follow the flow of execution by trying various input values—positives, negatives, or even zeros. When the user enters a positive number, the variable positivesCount increments by one; and when they enter a negative number or zero, it remains unchanged. Everything appears to runs smoothly, doesn't it? —so smoothly that it might make you question if this book is reliable or if you should throw it away!</p>
<p class="my_basic">The problem becomes evident only when the user attempts to enter all three of the expected positive values. The trace table that follows can help you determine where the problem lies. Let's assume that the user wants to enter the values 5, −10, −2, 4, and 20.</p>

</div>
<p class="my_basic">And here is the logic error! At step 20, even though the total number of user-provided positives is three, and you expect the execution to end, unfortunately the user is being asked to enter an additional number! But, you needed a code fragment that lets the user enter three positive numbers, not four, right?</p>
<p class="my_basic">This is why you should always go by the book! Let's see how this code fragment should be written.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Since the Boolean expression of the while-loop is dependent on the variable positivesCount, this is the variable that must be initialized outside of the loop. This variable must also be updated/altered within the loop. The statement that does this update/alteration must be the last statement within the loop, as shown in the code fragment (in general form) that follows.</p>
<div><p>positivesCount = 0    #Initialization of positivesCount</p>
<p>while positivesCount != 3: #This is dependent on positivesCount</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements</p></div>
<p>if x &gt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>positivesCount += 1   #Update/alteration of positivesCount</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now you can add any necessary statements to complete the code. The only statements that you need to add here are the statement that lets the user enter a number (this must be done within the loop), and the statement that displays the last message (this must be done when the loop finishes all of its iterations). So, the final code fragment becomes</p>
<div><p>positivesCount = 0</p>
<p>while positivesCount != 3:</p>
<p>x = float(input())</p>
<p>if x &gt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>positivesCount += 1</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>print("Three positives provided!")</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_4">28.4 Breaking Out of a Loop</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Loops can consume too much CPU time so you have to be very careful when you use them. There are times when you need to break out of, or end, a loop before it completes all of its iterations, usually when a specified condition is met.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Suppose there is a hidden password and you somehow know that it is three characters long, containing only digits. The following for-loop performs 900 iterations in an attempt to find that hidden password using a brute-force attack.</p>
<div><p>found = False</p>
<p>for i in range(100, 1000):</p>
<p>if i == hiddenPassword:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>password = i</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>if found == True:</p>
<p>print("Hidden password is:", password)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>A brute-force attack is the simplest method to gain access to anything that is password protected. An attacker tries combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, suppose that the hidden password is 123. As you already know, the for-loop iterates a specified number of times, and in this case, it doesn't care whether the hidden password is actually found or not. Even though the password is found in the 24<sup>th</sup> iteration, the loop unfortunately continues to iterate until variable i reaches the value of 999, thus wasting CPU time.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Someone may argue that 800 – 900 iterations are not a big deal, and they would probably be right. However, in large-scale data processing, every iteration counts. Therefore, you should be very careful when using loop control structures, especially those that iterate too many times. What if the hidden password was ten digits long? This would mean that the for-loop would have to perform 9,000,000,000 iterations!</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are two approaches that can help you make programs like the previous one run faster. The main idea, in both of them, is to break out of the loop when a specified condition is met; in this case when the hidden password is found.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Using the break statement</p>
<p class="my_basic">You can break out of a loop before it actually completes all of its iterations by using the break statement.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Look at the following Python program. When the hidden password is found, the flow of execution immediately exits (breaks out of) the for-loop.</p>
<div><p>found = False</p>
<p>for i in range(100, 1000):</p>
<p>if i == hiddenPassword:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>password = i</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>break</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>if found:</p>
<p>print("Hidden password is:", password)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The statement if found is equivalent to the statement if found == True</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Using a flag</p>
<p class="my_basic">The break statement doesn't actually exist in all computer languages; and since this book's intent is to teach you “Algorithmic Thinking” (and not just special statements that only Python supports), let's look at an alternate approach.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In the following Python program, when the hidden password is found, the Boolean expression found == False forces the flow of execution to exit the loop.</p>
<div><p>found = False</p>
<p>i = 100</p>
<p>while found == False and i &lt;= 999:</p>
<p>if i == hiddenPassword:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>password = i</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>found = True</p></blockquote></div>
<p>i += 1</p>
<div></div>
<p>if found:</p>
<p>print("Hidden password is:", password)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Consider variable found as a flag. Initially, the flag is not “raised” (found = False). The flow of execution enters the loop, and it keeps iterating as long as the flag remains down (while found == False …). When something occurs within the loop that raises the flag (assigning True to the variable found), the flow of execution exits the loop.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The while found == False and i &lt;= 999 can alternatively be written as while not found and i &lt;= 999.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The i &lt;= 999 Boolean expression is still necessary in case the hidden password is not found.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_5">28.5 Cleaning Out Your Loops</h3>
<p class="my_basic">As already stated, loops can consume too much CPU time, so you must be very careful and use them sparingly. Although a large number of iterations is sometimes inevitable, there are always things that you can do to make your loops perform better.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The next code fragment calculates the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, … 10000.</p>
<div><p>s = 0</p>
<p>i = 1</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<p>countOfNumbers = 10000</p>
<p>s = s + i</p>
<p>i += 1</p>
<p>if i &gt; countOfNumbers : break</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(s)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">What you should always keep in mind when using loops, especially those that perform many iterations, is to avoid putting any statement inside a loop that serves no purposes in that loop. In the previous example, the statement countOfNumbers = 10000 is such a statement. Unfortunately, as long as it exists inside the loop, the computer executes it 10000 times for no reason, which of course affects the computer's performance.</p>
<p class="my_basic">To resolve this problem, you can simply move this statement outside the loop, as follows.</p>
<div><p>countOfNumbers = 10000</p>
<p>s = 0</p>
<p>i = 1</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<p>s = s + i</p>
<p>i += 1</p>
<p>if i &gt; countOfNumbers: break</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(s)</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_6">Exercise 28.5-1 Cleaning Out the Loop</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">The following code fragment calculates the average value of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, … 10000. Try to move as many statements as possible outside the loop to make the program more efficient.</p>
<div><p>s = 0</p>
<p>for i in range(1, 10001):</p>
<p>s = s + i</p>
<p>average = s / 10000</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(average)</p>
</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">One very common mistake that novice programmers make when calculating average values is to put the statement that divides the total sum by how many numbers there are in the sum (here average = s / 10000) inside the loop. Think about it! Imagine that you want to calculate your average grade in school. Your first step would be to calculate the sum of the grades for all 10 courses that you're taking. Then, when all your grades have been summed up, you would divide that sum by 10. This means that you would perform 10 additions and only one division.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Calculating an average is a two-step process.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Therefore, it is pointless to calculate the average value inside the loop. You can move this statement outside and right after the loop, and leave the loop just to sum up the numbers as follows.</p>
<div><p>s = 0</p>
<p>for i in range(1, 10001):</p>
<p>s = s + i</p>
<div></div>
<p>average = s / 10000</p>
<p>print(average)</p>

</div>
<h3 id="toc_8">28.6 Endless Loops and How to Stop Them</h3>
<p class="my_basic">All while-loops must include something inside the loop that eventually leads the flow of execution to exit the loop. But mistakes do happen! For instance, the following code fragment contains an endless loop. Unfortunately, the programmer forgot to increase variable i inside the loop; therefore, variable i can never reach the value 10.</p>
<div><p>i = 1</p>
<p>while i != 10:</p>
<p>print("Hello there!")</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>If a loop cannot stop iterating, it is called an endless loop or an infinite loop.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Another mistake that a programmer can make is something like the following:</p>
<div><p>i = 1</p>
<p>while i != 10:</p>
<p>print("Hello there!")</p>
<p>i += 2</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Even though this code fragment does contain a statement that increases variable i inside the loop (i += 2), unfortunately the flow of execution never exits the loop because the value 10 is never assigned to the variable i.</p>
<p class="my_basic">An endless loop continues to iterate forever, and the only way to stop it from iterating is to use magic forces! For example, when an application in a Windows operating system “hangs” (probably because the flow of execution entered an endless loop), the user must use the key combination ALT+CTRL+DEL to force the application to end.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In IDLE, if you execute a code that enters an endless loop, you can hit the CTRL+C key combination, and the Python compiler will stop the execution.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In Visual Studio Code, when you accidentally write and execute an endless loop, you can simply click on the “Stop” <img alt="Image" class="height1" src="img/vs_code_stop_button.png"/> toolbar icon, and the execution will stop.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In Visual Studio Code, an alternative way to force the application to end is to use the key combination CTRL+C within the Terminal window.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_9">28.7 The “From Inner to Outer” Method</h3>
<p class="my_basic">From inner to outer is a method proposed by this book to help you learn “Algorithmic Thinking” from the inside out. This method first manipulates and designs the inner (nested) control structures and then, as the algorithm (or the program) is developed, more and more control structures are added, nesting the previous ones. This method can be used in large and complicated control structures as it helps you design error-free flowcharts or even Python programs. This book uses this method wherever and whenever it seems necessary.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's try the following example.</p>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that displays the following multiplication table as it is shown below.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width40" src="img/chapter28-03.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">According to the “from inner to outer” method, you start by writing the inner control structure, and then, when everything is tested and operates fine, you can add the outer control structure(s).</p>
<p class="my_basic">So, let's try to display only the first line of the multiplication table. If you examine this line, it reveals that, in each multiplication, the multiplicand is always 1. Let's consider the multiplicand as variable i with a value of 1. The loop control structure that displays only the first line of the multiplication table is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> Code Fragment 1</div>
<div><p>for j in range(1, 11):</p>
<p>print(i, "x", j, "=", i * j, end = "\t")</p>
</div>

<p>1)When the number of iterations is unknown, you can use a definite loop.</p>
<p>2)When the number of iterations is known, you cannot use a post-test loop structure.</p>
<p>3)According to the “Ultimate” rule, in a pre-test loop structure, the initialization of the variable that participates in the loop's Boolean expression must be done inside the loop.</p>
<p>4)According to the “Ultimate” rule, in a pre-test loop structure, the statement that updates/alters the value of the variable that participates in the loop's Boolean expression must be the last statement within the loop.</p>
<p>5)According to the “Ultimate” rule, in a post-test loop structure, the initialization of the variable that participates in the loop's Boolean expression can sometimes be done inside the loop.</p>
<p>6)According to the “Ultimate” rule, in a post-test loop structure, the update/alteration of the variable that participates in the loop's Boolean expression must be the first statement within the loop.</p>

    <p class="normal">Our work with an architecture is not finished when a system is up and running. A working application requires ongoing maintenance and effort to keep it running successfully.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Systems will be in a maintenance phase during the longest part of their life cycles. This phase is where we add features, detect and fix defects, and analyze the system's behavior to prevent problems. </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">To be able to do that successfully, we need to have tools to cover two basic elements:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <ul>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet"><em class="italic">Observability</em>: This is the capability of knowing what's going on in a live system. Low-observability systems <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>are difficult or even impossible to understand, which makes it difficult to know if there are problems or work out the cause of those problems. In high-observability systems, it's easy to infer the internal state and the events flowing inside the system, which allows for easy detection of the critical structures where problems are being generated.The main tools for observing<a id="_idIndexMarker824"/> systems are <strong class="keyword">logs</strong> and <strong class="keyword">metrics</strong>, which are used in conjunction to allow us to <a id="_idIndexMarker825"/>understand the system and analyze its behavior.<p class="bullet-para">Observability is a property of the system itself. Typically, monitoring is the action of obtaining information about the current or past state of the system. It's all a bit of a naming debate, but technically, you <em class="italic">monitor</em> the system to collect the <em class="italic">observable</em> parts of it.</p>&#13;&#13;
      </li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet"><em class="italic">Analysis</em>: To detect problems in more<a id="_idIndexMarker826"/> controlled situations, we have two important tools, <strong class="keyword">debugging</strong> and <strong class="keyword">profiling</strong>. The first is a staple of the development<a id="_idIndexMarker827"/> process, working step by step through code to understand how a piece of code works and ascertain why it's doing what it is doing. Profiling is instrumenting the code <a id="_idIndexMarker828"/>to show how it works and, specifically, determine which parts take the most time to execute, to allow you to act on them and improve their performance.These two tools work complementarily with one another and allow us to fix and improve different kinds of problems after they've been detected.</li>&#13;&#13;
    </ul>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this section, we will also talk about the challenge of making changes while the system is in operation. The only constant in software is change, and balancing existing systems with new functionalities is a critical ability. Part of this task is to coordinate between different teams so they are aware of the implications of their changes and can work as a single unit.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">This section comprises of the following chapters:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <ul>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Logging</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Metrics</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Profiling</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Debugging</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Ongoing architecture</li>&#13;&#13;
    </ul>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will start by understanding how to use logs for monitoring.</p>&#13;&#13;

    to apply these components with some third-party tools to build microservices applications.
    You will need a background in Python programming, knowledge of the principles
    of API development, and an understanding of the principles behind creating an
    enterprise-grade microservice application. This is more than a reference book:
    it provides some code blueprints that will help you solve real-world applications
    while elaborating on and demonstrating the topics of each chapter.'

- en: This book is for Python web developers, advanced Python users, and backend developers
    using Flask or Django who want to learn how to use the FastAPI framework to implement
    microservices. Readers knowledgeable about REST API and microservices will also
    benefit from this book. Some parts of the book contain general concepts, processes,
    and instructions that intermediate-level developers and Python enthusiasts can
    relate to as well.

    the topics. If you get lost during setup, each project has a backed-up database
    (`.sql`or`.zip`) and a list of modules (`requirements.txt`) to fix some issues.
    Run the `\i`PostgreSQL command to install the script file or use the mongorestore
    from the installed Mongo Database Tools to load all the database content. Also,
    each project has a mini-readme that gives a general description of what the prototype
    wants to accomplish.

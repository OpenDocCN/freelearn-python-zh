			<p>We continue our journey by learning the advanced concepts of the Python language in this section. This includes a refresher of some concepts for you with an introduction to advanced subjects such as iterators, generators, errors, and exception handling. This will help you to move to the next level of programming in Python. In addition to writing Python programs, we also explore how to write and automate unit tests and integration tests using test frameworks such as unittest and pytest. In the last part of this section, we discuss some advanced function concepts for data transformation and building decorators in Python, and how to use data structures including pandas DataFrames for analytics applications.</p>

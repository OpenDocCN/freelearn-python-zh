<p class="mce-root">Many readers might feel that they have mastered the Python language and know everything it takes to write applications that utilize the best features of the language. This book aims to delve into aspects of Python and related technology that some developers have never experienced.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The book will unveil little-known or misunderstood aspects of Python related to the implementation of the standard library and provide understanding of how the modules actually work. The book shows the proper implementation of collections and the math module, along with numbers such as decimals and fractions that will help readers expand their horizons. Readers will learn about decorators, context managers, coroutines, and generator functions before learning about internal special methods in detail. The book explores the CPython interpreter, covering command options that can change how the environment functions as well as alternative interactive shells that improve on the normal Python experience. Readers will take a tour of the PyPy project, where they will be exposed to several new ways to improve speed and concurrency of their applications.&#160;Several Python Enhancement Proposals of the latest versions are reviewed to see what will be coming in the future of Python. Finally, it provides information on the different ways to document Python code.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Intermediate knowledge of Python is required though many topics are covered in a way that even beginners should have an understanding of the basic principles being covered. Specifically, the experience of using both the interactive Python interpreter and writing Python files, how to import modules, and how to work with object-oriented principles is assumed.</p>
<p>This book uses Python 3.6 for the examples, unless otherwise indicated. While alternative implementations are briefly discussed, the book assumes the basic CPython implementation is being used.</p>

<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>def print_funct(arg):
    print(arg)
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
        print_funct(sys.argv[1])</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random</strong><br/><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; random.randint(0, 1000)</strong><br/><strong>607</strong></pre>

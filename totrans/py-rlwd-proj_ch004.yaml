    is “How do we show others how well we can write software in Python?”

- en: Both of these questions have the same answer. We build our skills and demonstrate
    those skills by completing projects. More specifically, we need to complete projects
    that meet some widely-accepted standards for professional development. To be seen
    as professionals, we need to step beyond apprentice-level exercises, and demonstrate
    our ability to work without the hand-holding of a master crafter.

- en: We’re drawing a fine line between creating a PyPI package and creating a package
    usable within an enterprise. For PyPI, the software package must be installable
    with the **PIP** tool; this often adds requirements for a great deal of testing
    to confirm the package will work in the widest variety of contexts. This can be
    an onerous burden.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this book, we suggest following practices often used for “Enterprise” software.
    In an Enterprise context, it’s often acceptable to create packages that are *not*
    installed by **PIP**. Instead, users can install the package by cloning the repository.
    When people work for a common enterprise, cloning packages permits users to make
    pull requests with suggested changes or bug fixes. The number of distinct environments
    in which the software is used may be very small. This reduces the burden of comprehensive
    testing; the community of potential users for enterprise software is smaller than
    a package offered to the world via PyPI.

    cover projects to acquire data for analytic processing from a variety of sources.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    look at some ways to inspect data to make sure it’s usable, and diagnose odd problems,
    outliers, and exceptions.

    There are eight projects that tackle these closely-related problems.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The useful results begin with **Presenting Summaries**. There’s a lot of variability
    here, so we’ll only present two project ideas. In many cases, you will want to
    provide their own, unique solutions to presenting the data they’ve gathered.

    Modeling**. In some organizations, this may be the start of more sophisticated
    data science and machine learning applications. We encourage you to continue your
    study of Python applications in the data science realm.

    baseline project. The functionality is a “Hello, World!” application. However,
    the additional infrastructure of unit tests, acceptance tests, and the use of
    a tool like **tox** or **nox** to execute the tests is the focus.'

    and reporting. This chapter decomposes the large problem of “data analytics” into
    a number of smaller problems that can be solved in isolation.

<h3 id="toc_1">5.1 What is a Variable?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In computer science, a variable is a location in the computer's main memory (RAM) where a program can store a value and change it as the program executes.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Picture a variable as a transparent box in which you can insert and hold one thing at a time. Because the box is transparent, you can also see what it contains. Also, if you have two or more boxes you can give each box a unique name. For example, you could have three boxes, each containing a different number, and you could name the boxes numberA, numberB, and numberC.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width31" src="img/chapter05-01.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The boxes named numberA, numberB and numberC in the example contain the numbers 13, 8, and 4, respectively. Of course, you can examine or even alter the contained value of each one of these boxes at any time.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's say that someone asks you to find the sum of the values of the first two boxes and then store the result in the last box. The steps you must follow are:</p>
<p>1)Look at the first two boxes and examine the values they contain.</p>
<p>2)Use your CPU (this is your brain) to calculate the sum (the result).</p>
<p>3)Insert the result (which is the value of 21) in the last box. However, since each box can contain only one single value at a time, the value 4 is actually replaced by the number 21.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The boxes now look like this.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width31" src="img/chapter05-02.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">In a flowchart, the action of storing a value in a variable is represented by a left arrow</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width16" src="img/chapter05-03.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">This action is usually expressed as “Assign a value, or the result of an expression, to a variable”. The left arrow is called the value assignment operator.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that this arrow always points to the left. You are not allowed to use right arrows. Also, on the left side of the arrow only one single variable must exist.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In real computer science, the three boxes are actually three individual regions in main memory (RAM), named numberA, numberB and numberC.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width33" src="img/chapter05-04.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">When a program instructs the CPU to execute the following statement</p>
<p class="my_basic center">numberC ← numberA + numberB</p>
<p class="my_basic">it follows the same three-step process as in the previous example.</p>
<p>1)The numbers 13 and 8 are transferred from the RAM's regions named numberA and numberB to the CPU.</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">(This is the first step, in which you examined the values contained in the first two boxes).</p>
<p>2)The CPU calculates the sum of 13 + 8.</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">(This is the second step, in which you used your brain to calculate the sum, or result).</p>
<p>3)The result, 21, is transferred from the CPU to the RAM's region named numberC, replacing the existing number 4.</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">(This is the third step, in which you inserted the result in the last box).</p>
<p class="my_basic">After execution, the RAM looks like this.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width18" src="img/chapter05-05.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>While a Python program is running, a variable can hold various values, but only one value at a time. When you assign a value to a variable, this value remains stored until you assign a new value replacing the old one.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The content of a variable can change to different values, but its name will always be the same because the name is just an identifier of a location in memory.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">A variable is one of the most important elements in computer science because it helps you interact with data stored in the main memory (RAM). Soon, you will learn all about how to use variables in Python.</p>
<h3 id="toc_2">5.2 What is a Constant?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Sometimes, you may need to use a value that cannot change while the program is running. Such a value is called a constant. In simple terms, a constant can be thought of as a locked variable. This implies that when a program begins to run, a value is assigned to the constant, and thereafter, nothing can alter that value while the program is in progress. For example, in a financial program an interest rate can be declared as a constant.</p>
<p class="my_basic">A descriptive name for a constant can also improve the readability of your program and help you avoid some errors. For example, let's say that you are using the value 3.14159265 (but not as a constant) at many points throughout your program. If you make a typographic error when typing the number, this will produce the wrong results. But, if this value is given a name, any typographical error in the name is detected by the compiler, and you are notified with an error message.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Unfortunately, Python does not support constants. You can use a variable in place of a constant, but take care not to accidentally change its initial value each time you use this variable in your program.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In a flowchart, you can represent the action of setting a constant equal to a value with the equals ( = ) sign.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width11" src="img/chapter05-06.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>This book uses uppercase character to distinguish a constant from a variable.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Consider an algorithm that lets the user enter the prices of three different products and then calculates and displays the 20% Value Added Tax (known as VAT) for each product. The flowchart in Figure 5–1 shows this process when no constant is used.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width15" src="img/chapter05-07.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 5–1 Calculating the 20% VAT for three products without the use of a constant</p>
<p class="my_basic">Even though this algorithm is absolutely correct, the problem is that the author used the 20% VAT rate (20/100) three times. If this were an actual computer program, the CPU would be forced to calculate the result of the division (20/100) three individual times.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Generally speaking, division and multiplication are CPU-time consuming operations that must be avoided when possible.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">A much better solution would be to use a variable, as shown in Figure 5–2. This reduces the number of division operations and also decreases the potential for typographical errors.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width15" src="img/chapter05-08.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 5–2 Calculating the 20% VAT for three products using a variable, vat</p>
<p class="my_basic">This time the division (20/100) is calculated only once, and then its result is used to calculate the VAT of each product. But even now, the algorithm (which might later become a computer program) isn't perfect; vat is a variable and any programmer could accidentally change its value below in the program.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The ideal solution would be to change the variable vat to a constant VAT, as shown in Figure 5–3.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width16" src="img/chapter05-09.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 5–3 Calculating the 20% VAT for three products using a constant, VAT</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that when a constant is declared in a flowchart, the equals ( = ) sign is used instead of the left arrow.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">This last solution is the best choice for many reasons.</p>
<p>►No one, including the programmer, can change the value of constant VAT just by accidentally writing a statement such as VAT ← 0.60 in any position of the program.</p>
<p>►The potential for typographical errors is minimized.</p>
<p>►The number of arithmetic operations is kept as low as possible.</p>
<p>►If one day the finance minister decides to increase the Value Added Tax rate from 20% to 22%, the programmer will need to change just one line of code!</p>
<h3 id="toc_3">5.3 How Many Types of Variables and Constants Exist?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Many different types of variables and constants exist in most computer languages. The reason for this diversity is the different types of data each variable or constant can hold. Most of the time, variables and constants hold the following types of data.</p>
<p>►Integers: An integer value is a positive or negative number without any fractional part, such as 5, 100, 135, −25, and −5123.</p>
<p>►Reals: A real value is a positive or negative number that includes a fractional part, such as 5.1, 7.23, 5.0, 3.14, and −23.78976. Real values are also known as floats.</p>
<p>►Booleans<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_7" id="Link_To_Endnote_7">[7]</a></sup>: A Boolean variable (or constant) can hold only one of two values: True or False.</p>
<p>►Characters: A character is an alphanumeric value (a letter, a symbol, or a digit), and it is usually enclosed in single or double quotes, such as “a”, 'c', or “@”. In computer science, a sequence of characters is known as a string!!! Probably the word “string” makes you visualize something wearable, but unfortunately it's not. Please keep your dirty precious mind focused on computer science! Examples of strings are  “Hello Zeus”, “I am 25 years old”, or “Peter Loves Jane For Ever”.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In Python, strings can be enclosed either in single or double quotes.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_4">5.4 Rules and Conventions for Naming Variables and Constants in Python</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Certain rules must be followed when you choose a name for your variable or constant.</p>
<p>►The name of a variable or constant should only consist of Latin characters (English uppercase or lowercase characters), numbers, and the underscore character ( _ ). Especially for constants, even though lowercase letters are permitted, it is advisable to use only uppercase letters. This convention aids in visually distinguishing constants from variables. Examples of variable names are firstName, lastName1, and age while examples of constant names are VAT, and COMPUTER_NAME.</p>
<p>►Variable and constant names are case-sensitive, meaning there is a distinct difference between uppercase and lowercase characters. For example, myVAR, myvar, MYVAR, and MyVar are actually four different names.</p>
<p>►No space characters are allowed. If a variable or constant name consists of more than one word, you can use the underscore character ( _ ) between the words or start each word (except the first one) capitalized (Camel Case convention). For example, the variable name student first name is incorrect. Instead, you might use student_first_name, or even better, studentFirstName.</p>
<p>►A valid variable or constant name can start with a letter, or an underscore. Numbers are allowed, but they cannot be used at the beginning of the name. For example, the variable name 1studentName is not properly written. Instead, you might use something like studentName1 or student1Name.</p>
<p>►A variable or constant name is usually chosen in a way that describes the meaning and the role of the data it contains. For example, a variable that holds a temperature value might be named temperature, temp, or even t.</p>
<p>►Do not use any of the reserved words of Python as a variable or constant name. For example, the name While cannot be a valid variable or constant name since it is a reserved word in Python.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Unfortunately, Python does not support constants in the same way that some other computer languages do (such as C#, or C++). You can use a variable instead, but take care not to accidentally change its initial value each time you use this variable in your program.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The “Camel Case convention” is a style for naming identifiers (variables, subprograms, classes etc.) in computer programming. It is called "Camel Case" because the capital letters in the middle of the name resemble the humps of a camel. There are two main variations of Camel Case: a) Lower Camel Case (or Camel Case), where the first letter of the identifier starts with a lowercase letter, and the first letter of each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter; and b) Upper Camel Case (or Pascal Case), which is similar to Lower Camel Case, but also, the first letter of the identifier starts with an uppercase letter.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The Lower Camel Case convention is often used for naming variables and subprograms, while the Upper Camel Case is for naming classes. You will learn more about subprograms and classes in <a href="part07.html">Part VII</a> and <a href="part08.html">Part VIII</a> correspondingly.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_5">5.5 What Does the Phrase “Declare a Variable” Mean?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Declaration is the process of reserving a portion in main memory (RAM) for storing the content of a variable. In many high-level computer languages, the programmer must write a specific statement to reserve that portion in the RAM before the variable can be used. In most cases, they even need to specify the variable type so that the compiler or the interpreter knows exactly how much space to reserve.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Here are some examples showing how to declare a variable in different high-level computer languages.</p>
<div><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="my_table">

<h3 id="toc_6">5.6 How to Declare Variables in Python</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In Python, there is no need to declare variables as you would in C# or C++. Variables are declared when first used.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Below are examples presenting the declaration of some variables in Python. The names follow the Lower Camel Case  convention as well as all the rules for naming variables presented in <a href="#toc_4">Section 5.4</a>.</p>
<div><p>number1 = 0</p>
<p>found = False</p>
<p>firstName = "Hera"</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In Python, assigning a value to a variable is accomplished using the equals ( = ) sign. This operation is equivalent to the left arrow in flowcharts.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In Python  you assign a value to a variable of type string using double quotes ("  ").</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_7">5.7 How to Declare Constants in Python</h3>
<p class="my_basic">You must accept it! You cannot declare constants in Python, there is no such option! However, you can still use variables (preferably in uppercase) instead and take care not to alter their initial values each time you use these variables in your program.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following examples declare some variables (used as constants) in Python. They follow all the rules and conventions for naming constants presented in <a href="#toc_4">Section 5.4</a>.</p>
<div><p>VAT = 0.22</p>
<p>NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS = 25</p>
<p>FAVORITE_SONG = "We are the world"</p>
<p>FAVORITE_CHARACTER = "w"</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>In computer programming, once a constant is defined, its value cannot be altered while the program is running. Unfortunately, this is not true for Python. Since you use a variable in place of a constant, you must be careful not to accidentally alter their initial values below in your programs.</p>
</div>

- en: Python is the preferred language choice of developers, engineers, data scientists,
    and hobbyists everywhere. It is a great scripting language that can power your
    applications and provide speed, safety, and scalability. By exposing Python as
    a series of simple recipes, this book can help you gain insights into specific
    language features in a concrete context. The idea is to avoid abstract discussions
    of language features and focus on applying the language to concrete data and processing
    problems.

- en: All you need to follow through the examples in this book is a computer running
    any Python, version 3.12 or newer. Many of the examples can be adapted to work
    with Python 3 versions prior to 3.12\. Material in Chapter [10](ch014.xhtml#x1-57300010)
    describes the match statement, introduced with Python 3.10.

    operating system Python. The language run-time can be downloaded from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    An alternative is to start with the Miniconda tool ( [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
    and use conda to create a Python 3.12 (or newer) environment.

- en: The book is for web developers, programmers, enterprise programmers, engineers,
    and big data scientists. If you are a beginner, this book can get you started.
    If you are experienced, it will expand your knowledge base. A basic knowledge
    of programming will help; while some foundational topics are covered, this is
    not a tutorial on programming or Python.

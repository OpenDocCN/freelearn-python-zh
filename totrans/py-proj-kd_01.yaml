    never coded before because each exercise in this book is designed to get you ready
    to code. If you have coded before, you will find that this book has some really
    helpful exercises that can help make your code even better. Additionally, there
    are some more advanced projects toward the end of the book, which you should definitely
    take a look at!

    probably want to follow each lesson in order so that you can build the skills
    you need to make a game or another kind of computer program. The final project
    in this book will be a game. If you have some other programming experience, such
    as making modifications to your computer games, using programs such as Scratch
    or Logo or trying some of the free programming classes on the Internet, then you
    might decide to skim this book first to see what you already know. It is still
    recommended that you follow the contents of this book in the order they are presented,
    as each project builds on the projects that were explained in the previous chapter.

    we can put in them. Then, we will build some functions that put these variables
    together and help us make blocks of code that have special jobs. Finally, we will
    even learn how to make a computer ask a user questions and store their answers
    so that our programs can become interactive!

  zh: 在下一章中，你将学习Python程序的基础构建块。我们将从变量开始，了解我们可以放入其中的所有不同类型的信息。然后，我们将构建一些函数，将这些变量组合起来，帮助我们创建具有特殊任务的代码块。最后，我们甚至将学习如何让计算机向用户提问并存储他们的答案，这样我们的程序就可以变得交互式了！

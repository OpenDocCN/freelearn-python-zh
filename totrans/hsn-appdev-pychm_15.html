<h1 id="_idParaDest-363"><a id="_idTextAnchor380"/>More Possibilities with Plugins</h1>
<p>Any IDE worth its salt is extensible via a plugin architecture. The big names from Microsoft, Eclipse, and JetBrains support plugins as do the smaller, free, and open source IDE projects such as Geany and Ninja IDE. Even vim, which is as bare bones as it gets given it has no GUI, has a plethora of plugins available that allow you to customize your experience beyond the capabilities of the shipped product. In the case of JetBrains IDEs, the plugin architecture is at the heart of everything they build.</p>
<p>Consider that JetBrains started with IntelliJ and from that, built a dozen or so specialty IDEs. The reason this was possible is that their architecture is based on plugins. PyCharm Professional includes all the core functionality of two other IDEs, WebStorm and DataGrip, because those features are simply sets of plugins.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to discuss some important plugins both from JetBrains and from third-party developers. By the end of this chapter, you will know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to leverage JetBrains remote development features that allow you to work on your local laptop while leveraging a remote environment such as a virtual machine, workstation, or server</li>
<li>How to work collaboratively with JetBrains <em class="italic">Code </em><em class="italic">With Me</em></li>
<li>How to work with Docker using the JetBrains Docker plugin</li>
<li>How to leverage development infrastructure as code using HashiCorp Vagrant within PyCharm</li>
<li>I’ll also cover some smaller, quality-of-life plugins including themes, specialized highlighters, additional languages, and of course, the Black code formatter</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-364"><a id="_idTextAnchor381"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>In order to proceed through this chapter, and indeed the rest of the book, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An installed and working copy of PyCharm. Installation was covered in <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Installation and Configuration</em>, if are jumping into the middle of the book.</li>
<li>Many of the sections in this chapter require connecting to services on the internet. A high-speed connection or a lot of patience is required for some of the demonstrations.</li>
<li>For the section on remote development, you’ll need a remote computer accessible via SSH and running a Linux operating system. This can be a physical machine or a virtual machine running via a cloud provider. I only cover connecting to a remote. I won’t go into a deep dive on setting up a Linux computer or virtual machine to serve as a remote.</li>
<li>For the section on Docker, I’ll be using Docker Desktop. You can find the installation instructions for your computer’s operating system at <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/</a>.</li>
<li>This book’s example source code from GitHub. We covered cloning the code in <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Installation and Configuration</em>. You’ll find this chapter’s relevant code at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Application-Development-with-PyCharm---Second-Edition/tree/main/chapter-15">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Application-Development-with-PyCharm---Second-Edition/tree/main/chapter-15</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-365"><a id="_idTextAnchor382"/>Bundled plugins and JetBrains Marketplace</h1>
<p>There have<a id="_idIndexMarker1304"/> been <a id="_idIndexMarker1305"/>several cases throughout the book where I pointed out useful plugins. I just couldn’t wait, and the plugins I showed you were either highly relevant to the particular chapter in play or just really cool and exciting. In the interest of being a responsible PyCharm mentor, I will collect myself, contain my enthusiasm (as much as I can), and pretend that you skipped immediately to this chapter, which might just be the best chapter in the book. Or not, you decide.</p>
<p>A great many features throughout JetBrains IDE products are built as plugins. You’re going to encounter two types of plugins: plugins made by JetBrains, and third-party plugins available in JetBrains Marketplace. Many plugins made by JetBrains are bundled in the various IDEs they make, but some have to be added or activated. Let’s start by exploring the <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> panel<a id="_idIndexMarker1306"/> available<a id="_idIndexMarker1307"/> in the IDE’s settings.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-366"><a id="_idTextAnchor383"/>The plugins window</h2>
<p>There are several <a id="_idIndexMarker1308"/>ways to get to the <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> window. Perhaps the simplest is to just close whatever project you might have open in PyCharm, which gives you the window we started with 15 chapters ago in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.1</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.1: The Plugins window contains all the tools you need to manage plugins in PyCharm" src="img/B19644_15_001.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.1: The Plugins window contains all the tools you need to manage plugins in PyCharm</p>
<p>At the top of the <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> window, you’ll find two important tabs: one shows you the plugins you have installed (<strong class="bold">2</strong>) and the other takes you to Marketplace where you can buy and install new plugins (<strong class="bold">1</strong>). Many of the plugins in Marketplace are free, but many of the better ones are not.</p>
<p>The gear icon (<strong class="bold">3</strong>) allows you to configure additional plugin repositories. I’ve never needed this, but it’s there if you do. You can also install a plugin from a local folder using the relevant menu found under the gear.</p>
<p>The search box (<strong class="bold">4</strong>) allows you to find plugins in the list. When you select a plugin you’ll usually get some information about it on the right side (<strong class="bold">5</strong>). Plugins can be enabled and disabled (<strong class="bold">6</strong>), so if your IDE behaves erratically after installing a plugin, you can turn it off temporarily or <a id="_idIndexMarker1309"/>uninstall it completely.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-367"><a id="_idTextAnchor384"/>Bundled plugins</h2>
<p>If you study the<a id="_idIndexMarker1310"/> list in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.2</em>, you’ll find that most of the plugins on this screen are bundled with PyCharm. These are plugins created by JetBrains and included in the normal PyCharm installation. It’s not a bad idea to examine this list and disable plugins you <a id="_idIndexMarker1311"/>aren’t likely to use. For<a id="_idIndexMarker1312"/> example, I use <strong class="bold">Terraform</strong> and <strong class="bold">Ansible</strong> for my DevOps and <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code </strong>(<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>). I am<a id="_idIndexMarker1313"/> not likely to use Puppet, so I should disable that plugin.</p>
<p>As you do this, you might find PyCharm warning you about dependent plugins. For example, there is a plugin for Less, which is a CSS meta-framework. I don’t use it, so it’s tempting to disable it. However, the JSX Styled Components plugin, which I do use in React projects, is dependent on Less. See <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.2</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.2: I am warned when I try to disable a plugin that is needed by another plugin" src="img/B19644_15_002.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.2: I am warned when I try to disable a plugin that is needed by another plugin</p>
<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker1314"/>case, I’d better leave <strong class="bold">Less</strong> enabled.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-368"><a id="_idTextAnchor385"/>JetBrains Marketplace</h2>
<p>If you’re up for<a id="_idIndexMarker1315"/> some retail IDE therapy, you can click the <strong class="bold">Marketplace</strong> tab and go shopping. Some plugins are free, some aren’t. You can search for and install plugins from Marketplace easily from this screen. If you buy one, you’ll likely be routed to the JetBrains Marketplace website so you can control your license.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-369"><a id="_idTextAnchor386"/>Making your own plugins</h2>
<p>Anyone can make<a id="_idIndexMarker1316"/> an IDE plugin using the Java programming language and IntelliJ Community or Ultimate editions. I won’t cover how to make a plugin, I’ll at least show you how to get started. In <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.3</em>, I have IntelliJ Community Edition open on the new project dialog. Given you have extensive experience with creating projects in PyCharm, I’ll tell you that all the IDEs are identical. IntelliJ is the original flagship IDE product from JetBrains.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.3: IntelliJ Community Edition has a project template for creating your own IDE plugins" src="img/B19644_15_003.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.3: IntelliJ Community Edition has a project template for creating your own IDE plugins</p>
<p>In addition to <a id="_idIndexMarker1317"/>the project template, there is also a hyperlink to a tutorial on building your plugin project.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-370"><a id="_idTextAnchor387"/>Requiring plugins for your projects</h2>
<p>Just as we <a id="_idIndexMarker1318"/>have a <code>requirements.txt</code> text file to list the names and versions of the packages necessary for a given Python project, we can specify particular plugins as requirements for a PyCharm project. This will ensure other developers have access to any plugin functionality you deem crucial to their success in collaborating on your project. <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.4</em> shows you how to set the required plugins for your project.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.4: The steps for requiring plugins" src="img/B19644_15_004.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.4: The steps for requiring plugins</p>
<p>First, having gone into your project’s settings and located <strong class="bold">Build, Execution, Deployment</strong>, find the <strong class="bold">Required Plugins</strong> menu item (<strong class="bold">1</strong>) and click it. Next, click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon (<strong class="bold">2</strong>) and select your required plugins from the dialog box that appears (<strong class="bold">3</strong>). Click <strong class="bold">OK</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-371"><a id="_idTextAnchor388"/>Useful miscellaneous plugins</h2>
<p>I want to devote the<a id="_idIndexMarker1319"/> bulk of this chapter to some very impactful plugins that are packed with complex features. Before I do that, though, let’s get the easy stuff out of the way. I’ll cover the small, interesting plugins you’re most likely going to think of when you search for IDE plugins. Some of these we have seen in other chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CSV plugin was covered in <a href="B19644_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>.</li>
<li>The Markdown plugin. This didn’t used to come bundled, but now it does and it definitely makes the cut.</li>
<li>The cell mode plugin, which we also covered in <a href="B19644_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s talk about a <a id="_idIndexMarker1320"/>few more, which I’ll group based on what they do.</p>
<h3>Theme plugins</h3>
<p>You spend 8 to 16 hours <a id="_idIndexMarker1321"/>a day staring at the IDE. You might as <a id="_idIndexMarker1322"/>well spend some time making it look cool. There are lots of color themes available. <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.5</em> shows my current favorite: the dark purple theme.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.5: The Dark Purple Theme is one of my favorites because it’s different than the standard VS Code dark theme" src="img/B19644_15_005.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.5: The Dark Purple Theme is one of my favorites because it’s different than the standard VS Code dark theme</p>
<p>When people walk by and see the IDE up, they’ll immediately know you aren’t one of those VS Code slaves with their ubiquitous out-of-the-box Microsoft dark theme. You could use the stock Darcula theme that comes with PyCharm, but for a University of Oklahoma grad like me, that theme has entirely too much orange in it. Pick something you don’t see every day and soon everyone at the cube farm will know you are the real deal!</p>
<p>I also like the Material Theme UI in a nice solarized blue. This plugin comes in a lite (free) and a paid version. If you look around, you’ll find a color theme that suits you as there are many from which to choose. The easy way to find your new favorite is to type a tag into the search box shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.6</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.6: You can filter your plugin search using tags such as “Theme”" src="img/B19644_15_006.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.6: You can filter your plugin search using tags such as “Theme”</p>
<p>I recommend <a id="_idIndexMarker1323"/>you<a id="_idIndexMarker1324"/> try this because for whatever reason, leaving the search box blank doesn’t yield a very long list of options.</p>
<h3>File handler plugins</h3>
<p>This class of <a id="_idIndexMarker1325"/>plugins <a id="_idIndexMarker1326"/>provides colored highlighting for some of the non-code files we use every day.</p>
<p>The .ignore plugin provides some nice formatting for any of the common ignore files such as <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>.dockerignore</code>.</p>
<h3>Tools integration plugins</h3>
<p>Paul Everitt, one <a id="_idIndexMarker1327"/>of the developer advocates for<a id="_idIndexMarker1328"/> PyCharm, often reminds us that the I in IDE stands for <em class="italic">Integrated</em>. You should never need to leave PyCharm for any reason. Besides writing code, developers need to interact with issue trackers, VCSs, continuous build environments, and potentially a plethora of infrastructure tooling. It is no surprise there are plugins to help with these types of integration. <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.7</em> shows the tag used to find these plugins.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.7: Use the Tools Integration tag to find integrations to your favorite infrastructure and DevOps tools" src="img/B19644_15_007.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.7: Use the Tools Integration tag to find integrations to your favorite infrastructure and DevOps tools</p>
<p>I used to be a heavy TeamCity user. If you use TeamCity, or any of the other JetBrains team tools, you’ll<a id="_idIndexMarker1329"/> find plugins that allow you to <a id="_idIndexMarker1330"/>monitor your builds, deal with issues, and more right from your IDE. For the record, Team City is still my favorite <strong class="bold">continuous integration</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI</strong>) server.</p>
<h3>Productivity plugins</h3>
<p>Developer <a id="_idIndexMarker1331"/>productivity <a id="_idIndexMarker1332"/>is the main reason to use an IDE in the first place. There are many additional features and integrations you’ll find under this tag. <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.8</em> shows this tag in action.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.8: Use the productivity tag to find tools to make you more productive" src="img/B19644_15_008.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.8: Use the productivity tag to find tools to make you more productive</p>
<p>My favorite DevOps <a id="_idIndexMarker1333"/>plugin by far is GitToolbox. Take a<a id="_idIndexMarker1334"/> look at one of my projects open in PyCharm with GitToolbox enabled.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.9: The GitToolbox plugin provides a lot of information about your project’s repository" src="img/B19644_15_009.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.9: The GitToolbox plugin provides a lot of information about your project’s repository</p>
<p>At a glance, I can <a id="_idIndexMarker1335"/>see the branch I am currently using along<a id="_idIndexMarker1336"/> with how many commits ahead or behind I am relative to my remote. The plugin will help you clean up old branches you haven’t used in a while, perform regular fetches at timed intervals, and validate your commit messages. My favorite feature might be that you see the <code>git blame</code> information for each line. I’m not the blaming type, but I find it very useful as a lead developer to see which of my colleagues has<a id="_idIndexMarker1337"/> worked on a particular file. It <a id="_idIndexMarker1338"/>definitely helps code reviews go a little bit faster.</p>
<h3>Completion plugins</h3>
<p>AI has become a game-changing<a id="_idIndexMarker1339"/> integral part of software development. Using the <code>/tag: Completion</code> tag <a id="_idIndexMarker1340"/>will list dozens of traditional and AI-powered code completion plugins, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.10</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.10: Completion plugins including the most popular AI implementations" src="img/B19644_15_010.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.10: Completion plugins including the most popular AI implementations</p>
<p>At the moment, GitHub Copilot and any of the dozens of ChatGPT plugins are very popular autocompletion plugins. Before you pay money for them though, check out my discussion of <a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/>JetBrains <strong class="bold">AI Assistant</strong> plugin in <em class="italic">Chapter 17</em>. It is currently in closed beta, so I can’t really include it here, but it is really good and more tightly integrated than any of these plugins.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-372"><a id="_idTextAnchor389"/>Code with me (and never be lonely again)</h1>
<p>Pair programming is <a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/>a popular practice introduced many years ago via the agile methodology known<a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/> as <strong class="bold">Extreme Programming </strong>(<strong class="bold">XP</strong>). While not as well known as Scrum or Kanban, XP has many of the same practices and goals, but with pair programming as a mandatory component. In XP, two programmers sit in front of one computer and write code together. One person types while the other watches, coaches, looks things up, and generally contributes by helping out. At fixed intervals the programmers trade places. Adherents to the practice swear by it, claiming it eliminates the need for code reviews and generally leads to better code. Detractors, which include every non-technical manager alive, say it doesn’t make sense to have two expensive, specialized workers doing half as much work as they should.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, you have to admit there is a great deal of utility in direct collaboration. The real issue is in a post-Covid world where a great many developers work remotely, the idea of two developers at one screen is no longer feasible, at least until now.</p>
<p>JetBrains has an integrated tool called <em class="italic">Code With Me</em>. This tool allows multiple developers to join a shared session online, where everybody works on a project at the same time on one computer. This plugin comes bundled with all JetBrains IDEs including PyCharm. You can <a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/>activate this by clicking the icon shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.11</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.11: To start a Code With Me session, click the icon indicated with the arrow" src="img/B19644_15_011.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.11: To start a Code With Me session, click the icon indicated with the arrow</p>
<p>You can set permissions for your guests. Remember, you are granting access to your computer! You should engage in sessions only with people you trust, and likewise only send your session links to people you trust.</p>
<p>Once you click <strong class="bold">Start Session</strong>, PyCharm creates a hyperlink you can share as you see fit. You can email it, but I most often see it sent to other developers via Slack or similar private chat services. Anyone who has the link can click to join the session. In addition to sharing the IDE, you also have normal conferencing tools. Participants can see and hear each other like you’d expect on a product such as Zoom or WebEx. <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.12</em> shows me conferencing with nobody, but it gives you an idea of what to expect.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.12: A Code With Me session in progress. Unfortunately, since I spend all my time writing books, I don’t have any friends to call, so it’s just me" src="img/B19644_15_012.jpg"/>

<p>This feature is useful in<a id="_idIndexMarker1345"/> a lot of scenarios beyond the obvious pair programming use case. You can use this for each class, or conduct a coding interview using something more realistic than a Google Doc.</p>
<p>If you intend to use this service often, you will need a subscription since there are limitations on session length and the number of participants you can invite. You can find out more at <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/buy/#commercial">https://www.jetbrains.com/code-with-me/buy/#commercial</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-373"><a id="_idTextAnchor390"/>Remote development</h1>
<p>At my office I have a<a id="_idIndexMarker1346"/> large, powerful, 60 lb full-tower HP workstation with dual Intel Xeon processors (a total of 48 cores), 128 GB of memory, a professional-grade NVidia GPU, and 24 GB GPU accelerator! It even has a <strong class="bold">serially attached small computer system interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAS</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker1347"/>running enterprise-grade storage! You really can’t get this kind of power in a laptop and there are days when I push it to its limits.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Our industry loves alphabet soup!</p>
<p class="callout">I’m just going to clear this up for all you engineering types who are trying to figure out how<a id="_idIndexMarker1348"/> the <strong class="bold">three letter acronym</strong> (<strong class="bold">TLA</strong>) <em class="italic">SAS</em> stands for no fewer than six words. It’s because the acronym <em class="italic">SAS</em> contains one letter that itself stands for another<a id="_idIndexMarker1349"/> acronym. It’s <strong class="bold">Serially Attached SCSI</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAS</strong>). <strong class="bold">SCSI</strong> stands<a id="_idIndexMarker1350"/> for <em class="italic">small computer system interface</em>. SAS drives are spinning disks that are capable of higher rotational speeds than your standard <strong class="bold">serial advanced technology attachment </strong>(<strong class="bold">SATA</strong>) drives, but<a id="_idIndexMarker1351"/> they are still nowhere <a id="_idIndexMarker1352"/>near<a id="_idIndexMarker1353"/> as fast as a <strong class="bold">solid-state drive </strong>(<strong class="bold">SSD)</strong> or <strong class="bold">non-volatile memory express </strong>(<strong class="bold">NVME</strong>) drives that<a id="_idIndexMarker1354"/> feature <strong class="bold">NOT-AND</strong> or <strong class="bold">NAND</strong> memory. SAS drives are, however, designed to be used in <strong class="bold">redundant arrays of inexpensive disks </strong>(<strong class="bold">RAID</strong>), which <a id="_idIndexMarker1355"/>makes them useful for inexpensively storing very large files in a fault-tolerant way.</p>
<p class="callout">All these acronyms and jargon are part of an industry-wide conspiracy designed to make your relatives, who have no idea what you do, both proud and uncomfortable at family gatherings and holidays.</p>
<p>But like probably every other developer out there, I’d also like to be able to work from home. Obviously, I’m not willing to lug my 60 lb workstation around with me. Even if I were, our security team isn’t going to like our source code leaving the building. True, I could use a remote technology such as VNC Viewer or Microsoft Remote Desktop, but those can be laggy and lack the creature comforts, such as support for four monitors, to which I have become accustomed.</p>
<p>I could also just work over SSH using <strong class="bold">neovim</strong>. But I think you and I, we’re past that, right? If you think that’s a<a id="_idIndexMarker1356"/> good idea, skip back to <a href="B19644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a> where I talked about it being a bad idea. So, what am I to do?</p>
<p>Thankfully, JetBrains has me covered. Using its remote plugins, which are pre-installed on PyCharm Professional, I can run my IDE on my PC at home, but operate on my workstation in my office. This is done <a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/>using <strong class="bold">secure shell </strong>(<strong class="bold">SSH</strong>), which is an encrypted communications protocol typically used to administer Linux and Unix-based servers.</p>
<p>Simply put, you can configure PyCharm to use a virtual environment (<code>venv</code>) that is installed and configured on your remote PC, along with the code on the remote hard drive. Everything runs on the remote except for the IDE itself. Your run configurations will execute your code on the remote. When you debug, the debugger is running on the remote rather than your local machine. It is fairly seamless, but there are a couple of downsides.</p>
<p>Firstly, you have to be somewhat knowledgeable about networking to configure a project to do this. You need to have the IP address of the remote, and you need to have valid access credentials that allow you access to the remote computer. In my case, I also need a <strong class="bold">virtual private network</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPN</strong>) client <a id="_idIndexMarker1358"/>running in order to access the network in my office, and this is external to PyCharm. While a VPN isn’t technically a requirement, in most scenarios, it should be.</p>
<p>The second trade-off is<a id="_idIndexMarker1359"/> performance. PyCharm isn’t exactly zippy on a good day. We have to wait for indexing to take place before we can use any of those amazing features we’ve been talking about throughout the book. It isn’t uncommon to get out-of-memory errors from PyCharm, which requires you to increase the amount of memory PyCharm is allowed to use. Updating or installing plugins requires you to restart the IDE, and even the initial loading screen hangs there longer than many of us would like. All in all, sometimes PyCharm can be a little clunky, but we put up with it because of the value it brings in easing our overall workflow.</p>
<p>I tend to think of PyCharm like a diesel truck. Such a truck isn’t going to win a quarter-mile sprint race against a Porsche or a Tesla Model 3. Being from rural Oklahoma, I can tell you nobody owns sports cars where I’m from because our diesel trucks are more than transportation, they are part of our livelihood. I can’t use a Tesla to tow a load of cows to auction, nor can I use a Porsche to haul hay to the back 40 to feed the horses. Likewise, we use heavy IDEs because we are willing to trade the “zippiness” of a minimal editor such as VS Code for some pretty extreme value presented by PyCharm’s indexing. The ability to find usages, jump directly to function definitions, and have such a tightly integrated set of tools covering everything from editing to database management is worth a little lag.</p>
<p>With that said, that lag can become more evident when you are working on a remote project. You can expect your indexing times to be longer because the indexing is happening remotely and is then transmitted back to you. Network latency and VPNs will always make things slower, and that isn’t PyCharm’s fault. We put up with it because you get to work from home in your pajamas, with your music turned up, close to your own kitchen and snacks, and you can limit your interaction with other humans, which normally just slows<a id="_idIndexMarker1360"/> people like us down. It’s worth it. Now that your expectations have been set, let’s look at how to make this work.</p>

<p>In all my books and<a id="_idIndexMarker1361"/> courses, I pride myself on<a id="_idIndexMarker1362"/> keeping everything as realistic as possible. For example in <a href="B19644_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor172"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, I had trouble with the PyCharm feature that is supposed to download Node.js for me automatically. I didn’t hide it, because that legitimately happened to me, which means it might also happen to you. There is value in learning to work around these kinds of issues.</p>
<p>By now, you might have noticed this chapter’s screen captures look different that those in previous chapters. I am writing this chapter on a day when I am working at home, and I’m using a Windows 11 PC that has not been configured to work remotely before today. Since this is my home computer, the screenshots might look a little different than those from previous chapters, particularly with respect to dark mode. I turned dark mode off for most of the book because the light mode is easier to read in a printed book, and I’m saving my publisher money on ink. Not today though. Because I’m keeping it real.</p>
<p>The first thing I’ll do is install and open PyCharm. Obviously, we’ve covered that already in <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, so there’s no need to do that again. The welcome screen provides the option for opening a remote project, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.13</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.13: The remote development options are clearly available on the right side of the welcome window" src="img/B19644_15_013.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.13: The remote development options are clearly available on the right side of the welcome window</p>
<p>There are several <a id="_idIndexMarker1363"/>options <a id="_idIndexMarker1364"/>here including SSH, which is what I’ll be using. JetBrains Space is a separate product, and I don’t own it, so I can’t really cover it. <strong class="bold">WSL</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong>, is likely<a id="_idIndexMarker1365"/> only going to show up if you’re using Windows. WSL allows you to run a Linux virtual machine directly in Windows without using an obvious hypervisor such as VMware or Virtual Box. I say <em class="italic">obvious</em>, because of course there is a hypervisor at play here – it is Microsoft’s <strong class="bold">HyperV</strong>, which <a id="_idIndexMarker1366"/>is built in to the professional editions of Windows 11 and Windows Server products. Windows 11 makes it seamless by allowing you to select one or more Linux installations via the Windows Terminal program that is new in Windows 11.</p>
<p>Since WSL is technically a virtual machine, it counts as remote development even though it happens on your local computer. For now, I’m going to focus on real remote development by accessing my workstation, currently about 12 miles away, over SSH. To be clear, my local computer is running Windows 11, but my workstation is running <strong class="bold">Pop_OS! 22</strong>, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/> a variant of Ubuntu Linux. You’ve seen it in the screenshots throughout the book. This adds to the magic! I can use a consumer-grade OS such as Windows or macOS to connect to a professional-grade Linux workhorse.</p>
<p>Before you jump on Twitter (now called X) to flame me for disrespecting your favorite OS, realize that this is the only possible combination. You have to connect to a Linux remote as Windows and Macs are not yet supported. I’m not sure what the hold-up is on macOS since it comes with an SSH server preinstalled. This workflow would make sense for a use<a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/> case<a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/> where you have a Mac Pro at work and something else at home. The setup screens that follow do indicate this functionality is intended for future releases.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.14</em> starts us off by showing what happens when we click the SSH option shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.13</em>. We are given a screen that allows us to create a new project on our remote, but only after we first configure our connection. This is going to be like creating an SSH connection for publishing our web projects, which we covered in <a href="B19644_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor172"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>.</p>

<p>Before you can<a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/> do <a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/>anything, you need to configure an SSH connection by clicking the gear icon indicated by the arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.14</em>. This brings us to yet another dialog, shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.5</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve gone ahead and <a id="_idIndexMarker1372"/>clicked<a id="_idIndexMarker1373"/> the <code>22</code>, so I’ve left the default set (<strong class="bold">6</strong>).</p>
<p>If you go back to the first position (<strong class="bold">1</strong>), you can click that pencil icon and give it a different name if you don’t like the aesthetics of a username and an IP. I’m renaming mine in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.16</em> to something<a id="_idIndexMarker1375"/> a little more<a id="_idIndexMarker1376"/> appropriate given its hardware specifications.</p>

<p>The rest of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1377"/>options<a id="_idIndexMarker1378"/> aren’t important to me because I don’t have to go through a proxy to get to my workstation. I went ahead and expanded all the closed options in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.15</em> so you can see any additional settings you might need.</p>
<p>Click <strong class="bold">OK</strong>, which takes you back to the earlier dialog. You’ll need to select the connection you just created from the dropdown. For me, the re-naming didn’t stick so it’s back to the username and IP as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.17</em>.</p>

<p>Note that you have the <a id="_idIndexMarker1379"/>option <a id="_idIndexMarker1380"/>here to go passwordless and use a private key. Using the SSH keys potentially limits the need for a password, but you can still be challenged to unlock the key. In either case, PyCharm can remember your password or your SSH key phrase for you if you’d like. If you work for a security-conscious company, you might check your guidelines to understand where it is considered appropriate for an application to store your passwords and key phrases.</p>
<p>Click the button labeled <strong class="bold">Check Connection and Continue</strong>. Assuming you gain access, PyCharm copies some software and settings over to the host and then presents you with our original<a id="_idIndexMarker1381"/> dialog<a id="_idIndexMarker1382"/> box, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.18</em>.</p>

<p>From here, we have three options. You can connect to the host with a terminal session by clicking it icon shown at (<strong class="bold">1</strong>). Clicking the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon at (<strong class="bold">2</strong>) allows you to create or open a project on the remote. The gear (<strong class="bold">2</strong>) allows you to either remove the host or manage the backends on the host. This latter option is explained by my earlier remark. When we connected for the first time, I told you that PyCharm copied some software to the host. The software in question is a lot like our toolbox application. It’s going to help us manage the IDE backends we’ll upload as part of our project creation process. There are several other IDEs you can use in this way and you have the ability to manage these backends here. If you click <a id="_idIndexMarker1383"/>it <a id="_idIndexMarker1384"/>right now, there won’t be any, because we haven’t created any projects yet. Let’s rectify that.</p>

<p>Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button indicated<a id="_idIndexMarker1385"/> at position (<strong class="bold">2</strong>) in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.18</em>.

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.19: We’re about to create a new remote project, which requires downloading the IDE backend and selecting a project folder on the remote</p>
<p>Remote project creation<a id="_idIndexMarker1386"/> requires you to specify which IDE you want to use and where you’d like to store your code on the remote hard drive. Given we’re invoking PyCharm to create the project, it might seem odd that it is asking us to choose which IDE we need. Remember, though, this isn’t really PyCharm. It is a plugin that can be leveraged by many of the JetBrains IDEs. Right now, you are really interacting with a different piece of software that just happens to be hosted in PyCharm.</p>
<p>We do get PyCharm as the default, so that’s something. Pay attention to the version. Mine is defaulting to the EAP version, which might not be what you want. Personally, I don’t use EAP unless I’m just testing them for backward project compatibility. I use the stable release in my day-to-day work. Pick the appropriate entry from the dropdown as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.20</em>.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.20: Select the IDE you want to use on the remote</p>
<p>The other, perhaps <a id="_idIndexMarker1387"/>obvious consideration is you will need to have a license for whichever IDE you choose. Next, we need to pick a location. This can be confusing since the layout of a Linux filesystem is different than what you encounter in Windows. Linux doesn’t use drive letters, and it uses forward slashes to separate path elements while Windows uses backslashes. Thankfully, I can just browse by clicking the three dots next to the project directory setting. Check out <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.21</em>.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.21: Click the three dots to browse the filesystem on the remote to pick your project directory</p>
<p>By default, the <a id="_idIndexMarker1388"/>directory browser will display your home folder on the remote. You can browse to the folder of your choosing. Unfortunately at the moment, one big missing feature is an option to create a new folder for your project. I’m sure that’s coming, but right now it is absent. We’re going to have to work around this. Click <strong class="bold">Cancel</strong>, then <strong class="bold">Back</strong> to navigate back to the screen shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.5</em>. Click the terminal button to launch an SSH terminal session on the host, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.22</em>.</p>

<p>Use the commands<a id="_idIndexMarker1389"/> shown to create a new folder. I already had a <code>PyCharmProjects</code> folder on the remote in my home folder. This is because PyCharm is actually installed on the remote since it’s my daily-use computer. You can make any folder that suits you within your home folder on the remote. You can exit the terminal session by typing <code>exit</code>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-376"><a id="_idTextAnchor393"/>Let’s try that again</h2>
<p>Like before, click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon, pick your IDE from the dropdown, and browse to the folder you just created.</p>
<p>Just think of this as being PyCharm without the UI. We’re connecting the frontend on our computer with the uploaded PyCharm backend on the remote.</p>
<p>Let’s bring our focus back to working on a project on the remote. Click the <strong class="bold">Download IDE and Connect</strong> button shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.23</em>.</p>

<p>This next part takes a few minutes. After you click the <strong class="bold">Download IDE and Connect</strong> button, a delightful orchestration of commands runs on your remote. The result is a running IDE backend, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.24</em>.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.25: Magical! It looks the same as working locally!</p>
<p>From here, you mostly <a id="_idIndexMarker1391"/>know what to do. Your IDE will function normally except for one step that was skipped: you were never prompted to create a virtual environment.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-377"><a id="_idTextAnchor394"/>Creating a virtual environment on the remote</h2>
<p>We’ve done <a id="_idIndexMarker1392"/>this before, in <a href="B19644_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, so I won’t<a id="_idIndexMarker1393"/> do another deep dive here, but there is one point that is confusing. Let’s look at it.</p>
<p>To create a virtual environment you need to go to the project settings and locate the setting for the project’s interpreter. Mine is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.26</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 15.26: When you add the interpreter, remember that while it is remote, it is treated as local" src="img/B19644_15_026.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.26: When you add the interpreter, remember that while it is remote, it is treated as local</p>
<p>The interpreter has defaulted to <code>/usr/bin/python3.9</code>, which is the global instance and not what I want. When I click the <strong class="bold">Add Interpreter</strong> button it gets a little confusing. You might be tempted to use <strong class="bold">On SSH</strong> because, well, we’re using SSH to connect to the remote. However, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1394"/>are connected to the <a id="_idIndexMarker1395"/>remote already, so PyCharm is running on the remote, which makes it a local interpreter. When you click <strong class="bold">Add Local Interpreter</strong>, you’ll note like in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.14</em>, the path is Linux-like rather than a Windows path. This would be less obvious to macOS users since the pathing looks the same.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-378"><a id="_idTextAnchor395"/>Other considerations</h2>
<p>Now that you have <a id="_idIndexMarker1396"/>this setup, you are effectively running PyCharm on the remote computer. All your file paths will show as Linux paths. Git and other revision control clients work with the remote folder. If you use SSH keys to authenticate with GitHub or your revision control host, you will need to configure the keys from the remote rather than just using your local public keys. Essentially, forget about your local computer entirely. You are operating completely on the remote.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-379"><a id="_idTextAnchor396"/>Working with Docker</h1>
<p>Container technology is one <a id="_idIndexMarker1398"/>of the most important advances in DevOps technology since the virtual machine. <strong class="bold">Docker</strong> and similar container technologies have revolutionized the way software applications are developed, deployed, and managed. Imagine containers as lightweight, standalone units that encapsulate all the necessary components to run an application, including code, runtime, system libraries, and settings. This encapsulation ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, from a developer’s laptop to production servers.</p>
<p>Docker, in particular, is a widely used platform for building, shipping, and running containers. It provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies, isolating them from the underlying host system. This isolation enables developers to avoid the notorious “<em class="italic">it works on my machine</em>” issue, as containers behave consistently across various environments.</p>
<p>Another major advantage of containers is their portability. Developers can package an application and all its dependencies into a container image, which can then easily be shared with others. This makes collaboration more efficient and reduces the chances of compatibility issues. Furthermore, containers are highly scalable. They can be quickly replicated to handle increased workloads, offering an excellent solution for modern, dynamic, and resource-demanding applications.</p>
<p>Docker also brings about improved resource utilization. Since containers share the host operating system’s kernel, they are more lightweight than traditional virtual machines, which require separate <a id="_idIndexMarker1399"/>operating systems. This translates to faster startup times, lower memory overhead, and a higher density of containerized applications on a single host.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-380"><a id="_idTextAnchor397"/>The bundled Docker plugin</h2>
<p>PyCharm Professional comes<a id="_idIndexMarker1400"/> with the JetBrains Docker plugin already bundled and enabled. You don’t have to do anything further to use the Docker plugin. You do, however, need to install Docker. On my development computers, I usually run Docker Desktop because I find the product’s GUI useful. It will be useful today as I show you how much you can do in PyCharm with Docker.</p>
<p>Let’s create a Flask project and run it in Docker.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-381"><a id="_idTextAnchor398"/>Create the project</h2>
<p>In PyCharm Professional, create a<a id="_idIndexMarker1401"/> new Flask project. If you’re skipping around, I showed you how to do this in <a href="B19644_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>. You can see my project settings in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.28</em>.</p>

<p>We won’t be making any<a id="_idIndexMarker1402"/> changes to the generated project except for adding a <strong class="bold">Dockerfile</strong>. <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.29</em> shows me doing this.</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 15.29: Right-click the project and click New | Dockerfile</p>
<p>In the preceding figure, I’m right-clicking the project, hovering over <strong class="bold">New</strong>, and clicking the <strong class="bold">Dockerfile</strong> menu option. This generates a Dockerfile template for me with the following contents:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
FROM ubuntu:latest
LABEL authors="BruceVanHorn"
ENTRYPOINT ["top", "-b"]</pre> <p>The first line indicates which Linux kernel will serve as the basis for our container image. I’m a pretty big fan of Ubuntu, but there are other possibilities. Alpine Linux is also very popular.</p>
<p>The second line is just what it says: a label for the image containing the author’s names. We don’t really need this, nor do we need the last line, at least in its current form. Let’s replace the generated template with something more useful. The corporation behind Docker maintains a large registry of pre-made containers you can use as a starting point for your work. Among them is a container with any given version of Python 3 already installed. I’m going to use Python 3.9, even though that isn’t the most current, because I happened to notice 3.9 is the<a id="_idIndexMarker1403"/> version on my PC when I generated the sample project:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
# Use the official Python 3.9 image as the base image
FROM python:3.9</pre> <p>On the next line, I’ll set the working directory inside the container. The container has a minimal file system with limited space. This is where our app code will live:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
WORKDIR /app</pre> <p>Next, I need to instruct Docker to copy my requirements text file and use <code>pip</code> to install my project’s requirements:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
# Copy the requirements file and install the necessary packages
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt</pre> <p>Next, I’ll copy my code to the container:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
# Copy the Flask application code into the container
COPY . .</pre> <p>The <code>COPY</code> instruction will copy the entire contents of my project folder, which would include the <code>venv</code> folder. Since the <code>pip</code> command will install our requirements, we don’t need a <code>venv</code> folder. I’ll fix this in just a moment. My next step in this file is to expose port <code>5000</code> on the container’s firewall so I can access the app:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
# Expose the port on which the Flask app will run
EXPOSE 5000</pre> <p>Finally, I’ll define the command to run the Flask app when the container starts:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
CMD ["python", "app.py"]</pre> <p>To fix the copy problem, I’ll make a file in the project folder called <code>.dockerignore</code>. This works the same way a <code>.gitignore</code> works, except obviously it is used to set file exclusions for Docker. The contents of the <code>.dockerignore</code> file are simply this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
venv</pre> <p>Incidentally, you can find a plugin in Marketplace called <code>.ignore</code> that adds formatting to an array of ignore files.</p>

<p>Once you click <a id="_idIndexMarker1407"/>the <strong class="bold">Bind ports</strong> option, PyCharm adds a configuration parameter for <strong class="bold">Bind ports</strong>. Oddly, there is a folder icon indicated by the right arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.33</em>.</p>

<p>It’s odd because we won’t<a id="_idIndexMarker1408"/> be browsing for a file or folder. When you click it, you get a <code>5000</code>, so all you need to do is specify a binding between <code>5000</code> on the container and <code>5000</code> on your computer. Click <strong class="bold">OK</strong> until you’re out of the run configuration. Run the run configuration. We explained run configurations way back in <a href="B19644_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, so if you’re joining us late, go back and review.</p>
<p>You should be treated to a textual light-show as Docker downloads the chunks to the container image, builds the container, and finally runs the app. You can see mine running in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.34</em>.</p>

<p>If you care to compare<a id="_idIndexMarker1409"/> the UI for Docker versus Docker Desktop, you’ll see many of the same features exist. A quick tour is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15</em><em class="italic">.35</em>.</p>

<p>At position (<strong class="bold">1</strong>) we can see three tabs. <strong class="bold">Build Log</strong> allows us to examine the output generated when Docker built the container from our Dockerfile. We have some basic controls to stop and restart the container at (<strong class="bold">2</strong>). Naturally, when the container is stopped, the option to start it will appear here as well. Then perhaps most usefully, you can use the <strong class="bold">Terminal </strong>button (<strong class="bold">3</strong>) to start a terminal session inside the container.</p>
<p>On the left side (<strong class="bold">4</strong>) we see a full display showing all our running containers, downloaded images, networks, and mounted volumes.</p>
<p>In sum, you can really do almost anything in PyCharm that you can do in Docker Desktop. Once again, PyCharm’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1410"/>mission to give you an integrated experience with one of the most important technologies in use today is fully realized!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-383"><a id="_idTextAnchor400"/>Summary</h1>
<p>PyCharm plugins are customized add-ons that can further add to the list of features and functionalities one can take advantage of while using PyCharm. We have seen how to browse through, download, and manage different plugins in the PyCharm environment. By taking advantage of these plugins, we can further customize our workspace and improve our own productivity. Plugin management in PyCharm can be done in the <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong> tab in the settings.</p>
<p>We looked at some simple plugins to enhance your quality of life while coding, such as theme plugins and some useful file handlers. We looked at one of my favorites, GitToolbox, which allows you to see a lot more details from your Git repository right in your IDE window.</p>
<p>We then branched out and looked at some very big-feature plugins that are fairly new to PyCharm 2023. Remote development is very useful in a post-pandemic world where more and more of us find ourselves working remotely. Even if you’re not, chances are you’re finding yourself working increasingly with cloud servers and virtual machines rather than always using the hard drive on your local laptop.</p>
<p>Another big advance is PyCharm’s support for Docker. The bundled Docker plugin provides full integration, from giving you autocomplete and syntax highlighting in Dockerfiles and composer files to a full GUI for managing your containers. You’ll find yourself never needing to leave PyCharm to jump over to Docker Desktop to handle your Docker operations. Naturally, if you’d like to, you’ll find both environments fully synchronized, and you could also use the <strong class="bold">Terminal</strong> window in PyCharm to interact with your containers that way if that is your preference.</p>
<p>Plugins are responsible for adding a lot of very cool and very useful features to our IDE. There are a few plugins that I didn’t cover because, to be honest, they’re not quite ready yet. I have some access to some closed beta features and some buried gems I want to cover in the next chapter. I can’t wait to show you some of the things that are coming up in future releases!</p>

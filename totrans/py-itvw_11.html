<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll</strong></span>: Why <a id="id290" class="indexterm"/>did you become a programmer?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé</strong></span>: In hindsight, I became a programmer for two reasons: to become the god of my little world and to impress my mom, who is a programmer as well.</p><p>When I <a id="id291" class="indexterm"/>was six years old, I was at a fair with my mom. There was a giant paper sheet on the floor, with a turtle that had a pen. You could program the turtle with cards to tell it where to go and when to put the pen down on the paper. I was obsessed with that turtle. The feeling of planning what would happen felt so good.</p><p>Years later, my mom got us a serious computer (the Thomson TO8D), and I could program in BASIC and Assembly. I built incredible things. With my mom's help, I was driving robots.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What sort of things did you do <a id="id292" class="indexterm"/>with the robots with your mom?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: Well, the computer we bought had a programmable serial port and extensions to get a parallel port, which was quite rare back then.</p><p>We were driving step engines in BASIC or Assembly (with a cartridge), since the ports could be directly addressed. This was nothing fancy, but as a kid, being able to do at home something similar to what we were doing with that turtle amazed me.</p><p>My mom also got one of those fancy Olivetti laptops, with a small needles printer that could print stuff in three colors. We were having fun printing fractals. My mom was doing the heavy lifting (as a math teacher) and I was just tweaking the colors.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So how did you come across Python?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: When I started<a id="id293" class="indexterm"/> coding professionally in the nineties, I was using Borland tools (C++Builder and Delphi) which could use VCL components.</p><p>My company bought some VCL components, but we were highly frustrated by the poor support from their authors and some bugs. That's when I discovered the Indy Project, which was developing and releasing open source VCL components that provided most network protocols. That library was to us, what Requests is to Python today.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'Communities built around open source projects struck me as the way to go in software computing.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I got intrigued by this open source concept. Communities built around open source projects struck me as the way to go in software computing. Through my online research, I found out about the Zope Project<a id="id294" class="indexterm"/> and eventually discovered Python through that. A few months later, I joined a company that was building a Zope CMS.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Have you done anything with robots using Python?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: Not really. I hacked a bit on a Raspberry Pi when I first got one. I also hacked a Wireless Ghetto Blaster using a <a id="id295" class="indexterm"/>suitcase, some old car speakers and a Raspberry Pi, with a Wi-Fi dongle and Mopidy.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'I also hacked a Wireless Ghetto Blaster using a suitcase, some old car speakers and a Raspberry Pi.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I looked at the OpenCV library through Python to do some image processing. Most of the other electronics projects that I worked on were on Arduino and its pseudo C language. My most advanced project was a small RC car and that was about it. I got a little bit bored after that.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Python is big in AI and machine learning at the moment. What do you think makes Python so <a id="id296" class="indexterm"/>popular?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: I think that Python has become popular for AI because the SciPy community has built some state-of-the-art frameworks and libs in the past few years (pandas, scikit-learn, IPython/Jupyter) that lower the bar for scientists to use Python instead of R or other tools.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'AI and machine learning innovation is spearheaded by academics...Python becomes a natural fit for them.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>AI and machine learning innovation is spearheaded by academics. Since Python has steadily grown as one of the main languages for learning programming in academics, Python becomes a natural fit for them.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What did you personally like about Python?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: I fell in love with <a id="id297" class="indexterm"/>Python and its community. Python is open source, versatile, and powerful, yet simple to code.</p><p>Coming from a C++ and Delphi background, at first I thought that Python was a weak scripting language that could not be used to build serious applications. Eventually, I became impressed by how simple it was to create Python programs that were concise and straightforward to understand.</p><p>C++ and Delphi <a id="id298" class="indexterm"/>looked over-engineered at that point for all of the network applications that I was building. I could just write Python scripts that followed the KISS principle and build serious web applications that way.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What would you say are Python's strengths and weaknesses as a language?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: Today, with over a decade of Python programming behind me, I think that Python's biggest strength is how visionary Guido van Rossum and the Python-Dev team are. As far as I can tell, every decision that was made in the last 20 years was a good one.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'Python's biggest strength is how visionary Guido van Rossum and the Python-Dev team are.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>From the memorandum (a CPython freeze designed so that other implementations like PyPy and Jython could catch up), to how asynchronous features were gradually added, Python got modernized in the right direction.</p><p>Each time that Python was getting a little bit behind compared to other languages, another feature would be added. Unlike some other languages that had a stellar start, then faded again, Python is steadily getting bigger every year.</p><p>One weakness for Python is <a id="id299" class="indexterm"/>the standard library. The fact that a package added in the stdlib is rarely removed is an issue. For instance, the stdlib currently has two classes named Future that are slightly different. One is in <code class="literal">asyncio</code> and one is in <code class="literal">concurrent</code>. I wish Python had a better story for its stdlib.</p><p>I think the biggest weakness of Python is the Python 2 versus Python 3 never-ending debate. That issue drove away some developers, because of the uncertainty about which version to use. It looks like we're getting past that debate now, which is great.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'I think the biggest weakness of Python is the Python 2 versus Python 3 never-ending debate.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What is your opinion on the <a id="id300" class="indexterm"/>long life of Python 2.7?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: I think that the transition took a while but it is happening transparently now and it is a success. The Python 2 versus 3 days are over, since the Python 3 ecosystem is now mature enough for most projects.</p><p>To my knowledge, <a id="id301" class="indexterm"/>there are no major libs or frameworks that are still lacking Python 3 support. So there's no good reason to start a new project using Python 2.7. People just use Python and for most of them it will happen to be Python 3. One day Python 2.7 will cease to exist and nobody will really miss it.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'One day Python 2.7 will cease to exist and nobody will really miss it.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How did you end up becoming an author of Python books?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: When I started programming in Zope and Python, I was the creator and maintainer of a French forum <a id="id302" class="indexterm"/>called Zopeur. I was spending a lot of time answering all of the questions.</p><p>Zopeur started as a one-man project, so if I stopped answering questions, then nobody else answered them. I was also learning so much by actually searching for answers and by diving into the details.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'I was also learning so much by actually searching for answers and by diving into the details.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>The first book that I wrote about Python came about because I wanted to dive deeply into Python and make my work useful to others. I was filling a gap too, since there were no original books in French about Python.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What have you<a id="id303" class="indexterm"/> learned in the writing process?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: Writing a book is a long and exhausting project. The first book took me nine months and was very painful to finish. It's easy to quit. It's also common to get lost in details and forget about the big picture. I've learned how to organize my thoughts and keep the big picture in my head.</p><p>When I wrote my first book in English, I also learned the hard way that it's difficult to write in a non-native language. You need to keep your sentences as straightforward and short as possible. I was also exposed to a larger community of readers, for better or worse.</p><p>The last thing to note <a id="id304" class="indexterm"/>about writing books is that you need to accept that your book will never be perfect. By the time you have finished writing, and you have read back through the first chapters, you will want to rewrite things all over again.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'You need to accept that your book will never be perfect.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Have you learned<a id="id305" class="indexterm"/> anything from your readers? If so, what?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: I've learned a lot from feedback from my readers. I still get a few emails from readers wanting to share their thoughts.</p><p>Sometimes readers want to point out some mistakes or share solutions that they think are better. I have received a few interesting threads that I wish had been available to me before my books were published. I think books that are published on the web in real time, allowing readers to send feedback as the writer delivers chapters, are superior for that reason.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Are you aware of any other books about Python that have come <a id="id306" class="indexterm"/>out in French since yours were published?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: To be fair, there was a Zope book before mine. But as far as I know, mine was the first book entirely dedicated to Python which was written in French, by a native speaker. Since then, there have been dozens of books written in French about Python. I am the old guard now.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'Mine was the first book entirely dedicated to Python which was written in French, by a native speaker.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Why did you found the <a id="id307" class="indexterm"/>French Python User Group, Afpy?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: As I mentioned earlier, I was maintaining a <a id="id308" class="indexterm"/>Zope/Python forum called <a id="id309" class="indexterm"/>Zopeur. At some point I had the idea of having a meeting in real life in Paris, with a dozen of the active members. We met for beers and we founded a foundation around Python. After that, I shut down my forum and we built Afpy on the ground.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What challenges did you face then and are there any challenges currently?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: The first few years of<a id="id310" class="indexterm"/> running Afpy were great. We were all good friends united around our passion for Python.</p><p>The first challenge that we met was how to integrate French companies that wanted to be part of Afpy. That took us a few years, because enterprises wanted to use our foundation as a tool to promote their business (sometimes aggressively). We were risking losing the original spirit of Afpy.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'We were risking losing the original spirit of Afpy.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>We were also a bit paranoid about what would happen if several developers from the same company were elected to the steering committee. But when we started to organize PyCon France, it became a natural fit for those companies to be sponsors. In hindsight, I think that we did the right thing by being protective.</p><p>Another challenge was trying to have more diversity in Afpy. We were mostly men and I wanted to make our foundation more welcoming to women. I did some work around that and found that diversity was a very controversial topic. Eventually, I got burnt out from politics and the work was not fun anymore.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'Eventually, I got burnt out from politics and the work was not fun anymore.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I was Afpy president for seven years, so I felt that it was the right time to move on. I am not sure what the current status of Afpy is, since I'm not involved. Afpy still looks like a vibrant user group though, which is great.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What made you choose Zope over <a id="id311" class="indexterm"/>some of the other alternatives?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: The standard was PHP-powered frameworks back then, but Zope was the cool stuff. Zope was very innovative and with Python it was more than web pages.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'Zope was very innovative and with Python it was more than web pages.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Plone was starting to take <a id="id312" class="indexterm"/>off and get very popular in France. Companies that specialized in building a CMS for government agencies often used Plone, because it had most features already built in. Plone, at one point, was at the top of the game for accessibility and groupware features.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Which <a id="id313" class="indexterm"/>Python web framework do you use now and why do you use it?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: At Mozilla we do a lot of Django and Flask, and a bit of Pyramid. Occasionally we use some Twisted and Tornado. Since we're now shipping most stuff in Docker images, developers that start new projects are not tied to specific Python versions anymore. So asynchronous frameworks are starting to get used.</p><p>When I can pick my framework of choice, I like to use Bottle, for very simple web services and Flask, for bigger projects that need a bit of UI. There are a large number of Flask libraries out there. That said, the next server-side project that I will start will be <code class="literal">aiohttp</code>, that's for sure.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Are you working on any <a id="id314" class="indexterm"/>open source projects yourself that you would like to talk about?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: I work on several projects, but a project that I am obsessed with <a id="id315" class="indexterm"/>right now is <code class="literal">molotov</code> (<a class="ulink" href="http://molotov.readthedocs.io/">http://molotov.readthedocs.io/</a>). It's a small load testing tool, based on Python 3.5+ and <code class="literal">aiohttp</code> client, that we're using to test our web services.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tarek Ziadé: 'A project that I am obsessed with right now is molotov.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>The design focuses on making it as straightforward as possible for developers to write a load test, by describing a scenario using simple Python coroutines. Once we have a set of those functions, then they are used to run simple smoke tests, load tests and distributed load tests.</p><p>Thanks to <code class="literal">asyncio</code> and <code class="literal">aiohttp</code>, the tool can send a pretty amazing load on our services and we're able to break most services with a single <code class="literal">molotov</code> client. I am adding on the top of this tool some CI Helpers, so we can continuously test the performance of our service.</p><p>One extension that I am going to add this quarter is the ability to deploy a stack with Docker images on AWS. This will happen prior to running the load test and grab back metrics once it's done. We also have a <a id="id316" class="indexterm"/>bigger project called Ardere, that drives AWS ECS for doing distributed tests. You can follow all of the work on those tools at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/loads">https://github.com/loads</a>.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll: What are you most excited about in Python today?</strong></span>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: Asynchronous programming. The addition of <code class="literal">async/await</code> in the language and projects like <code class="literal">aiohttp</code> are truly putting Python back into the game of building network apps. Of course, we have been able to do that with Twisted for over a decade, but now it's part of the core and implemented in a beautiful way. It's as easy as in Node.js to build async web apps in Python.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What changes <a id="id317" class="indexterm"/>would you like to see in future Python releases?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Ziadé</strong></span>: I'd love to see PyPy on a par with CPython (maybe we should have yet another memorandum so that PyPy catches up) and have the ability to run any of my projects with it (including C extensions). More anecdotally, I would love to see <code class="literal">setup.py</code> killed in our packaging system. It's the source of many issues. I've tried and failed (see PEP 390), but maybe one day it will happen.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Thank you, Tarek Ziadé.</p></div></body></html>

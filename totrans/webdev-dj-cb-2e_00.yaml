- en: Django framework is relatively easy to learn and it solves many web-related
    questions, such as project structure, database object-relational mapping, templating,
    form validation, sessions, authentication, security, cookie management, internationalization,
    basic administration, interface to access data from scripts, and so on. Django
    is based on the Python programming language, where the code is clear and easy
    to read. Also, Django has a lot of third-party modules that can be used in conjunction
    with your own apps. Django has an established and vibrant community, where you
    can find source code, get help, and contribute.

- en: '*Web Development with Django Cookbook - Second Edition* will guide you through
    all the web development process with Django 1.8 framework. You will get started
    with the virtual environment and configuration of the project. Then, you will
    learn how to define the database structure with reusable components. The book
    will move on to the forms and views to enter and list the data. Then, you will
    continue with responsive templates and JavaScript to create the best user experience.
    After this, you will find out how to tweak administration in order to make the
    website editors happy. You will also learn how to integrate your own functionality
    in Django CMS. The next step will be to learn how to use hierarchical structures.
    You will find out that collecting data from different sources and providing data
    to others in different formats isn''t as difficult as you thought. Then, you''ll
    be introduced to some programming and debugging tricks. Finally, you will be shown
    how to test and deploy the project to a remote dedicated server.'

    of the framework itself, but also with some important third-party modules that
    are necessary for fully-equipped web development. Also, the book gives examples
    of rich user interfaces using Bootstrap frontend framework and jQuery JavaScript
    library.

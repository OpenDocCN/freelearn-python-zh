- en: In this chapter, we are going to learn how to deploy Python applications on
    **Elastic Beanstalk**. Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS service that allows you to
    deploy web applications in the cloud. Basically, you don’t need to provision a
    server; Elastic Beanstalk provisions an infrastructure in the backend and deploys
    your web application. Another advantage of Elastic Beanstalk is being able to
    scale up your web applications when there are a large number of requests from
    the user.

- en: Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS service that is used to deploy web applications
    in the cloud. It supports multiple web application frameworks such as Python,
    Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, and Go. Once you deploy your application, Elastic
    Beanstalk manages the infrastructure in order to deploy, run, scale, and monitor
    applications.

    is behaving. For example, if an application goes down, you can check via Elastic
    Beanstalk.

    be updated with the latest improvements in Python or other libraries and Elastic
    Beanstalk manages the updates with you in control.

    has too many requests, it adds more resources, and your application can then meet
    the requests. On the other hand, if there is less demand, it reduces the resources
    and helps to reduce the cost.

			<p>HTML over WebSockets simplifies the creation of <strong class="bold">single-page applications</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPAs</strong>) by avoiding frontend rendering, giving real-time responses, and simplifying the logic by moving it to the backend. In this book, you won't learn how to use a JavaScript rendering framework such as React, Vue, or Angular, instead moving the logic to Python. This will simplify your developments, giving you real-time results with all the tools provided by Django.</p>
			<p>Developers will learn state-of-the-art WebSockets techniques to realize real-time applications with minimal reliance on JavaScript. They will also learn, from the ground up, how to create a project with Docker, test it, and deploy it on a server. </p>
			<p>You will follow the roadmap of a Django developer who wants to create SPAs with a good experience. You will create a project and add Docker, development libraries, Django channels, and bidirectional communication, and then you will create real projects of all kinds using HTML over WebSockets, such as a chat app or a blog with real-time comments. You will modernize your development techniques by moving from using an SSR model to creating web pages using HTML over WebSockets. With Django, you will create SPAs with professional real-time projects where the logic will be in Python.</p>
			<p>By the end of the book, you will be able to make real-time applications and will have mastered WebSockets with Django.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for intermediate-level Django developers and Python web developers who wish to create real-time websites with HTML and Django channels. If you are a developer looking for an alternative to creating an API without giving up the possibility of separating the frontend from the backend and do not want to depend on JavaScript to make SPAs, then this book is for you. Basic knowledge of HTML and Python along with an understanding of basic web development concepts is expected.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You will need a version of Docker and Docker Compose (or Docker Desktop, which includes everything) installed on your computer in the latest version and a code editor or IDE. I recommend PyCharm Professional. All code samples have been tested using Docker on macOS and Linux operating systems; however, they should also work without a problem on Windows.</p>

			<p> You will need the professional version of PyCharm  to have Docker integration. Otherwise, you can start Docker from the terminal or with Docker Desktop.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
			<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "The information from the frontend goes to <code>receive_json</code>, which in turn receives the <code>'text in capital letters'</code> action by executing the <code>self.send_uppercase(data)</code> function."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">* {</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">    box-sizing: border-box;</pre>
			<pre class="source-code">}</pre>
			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: "At the moment, the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> and <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> buttons are for decoration; later, we will give them their functionality."</p>

<p><em class="italic">Full-Stack Flask and React</em> is designed to be your definitive guide to mastering the art of full stack web development using the dynamic duo – React and Flask.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a curious learner looking to learn both frontend and backend development or an experienced developer looking to expand your skill set, this book is structured to take you on a journey of building modern web applications.</p>
<p>In today’s digital age, building web applications that are interactive, dynamic, and responsive seamlessly to user interactions is crucial. Flask, an open source, micro-web framework written in Python, promotes fast development and embraces a clean and practical design approach. On the other hand, React, a JavaScript library to build user interfaces, offers an efficient and flexible way to create interactive UIs. By combining the power of React and the lightweight Flask framework, you’ll gain the ability to create modern full stack web applications with ease.</p>
<p>In this book, we’ll head first to components-driven development with React and explore the fundamentals of React. We will explore concepts such as components, props and state, JSX, managing state with React Hooks, data fetching in React, displaying lists, events handling, routing with React Router, and unit testing with Jest. Then, we’ll continue with full stack application development with Flask.</p>
<p>We’ll cover everything from SQL and data modeling to creating RESTful APIs, integrating a React client with the Flask backend, authentication and authorization, building modular and reusable Flask applications with Blueprint, error handling, unit testing in Flask, and understanding how your web applications can be deployed to the cloud. We’ll break down complex concepts into bite-sized pieces, provide clear explanations, and offer practical examples to ensure that you grasp each topic along the way. Whether you prefer learning by doing or enjoy deep dives into the inner workings of these technologies, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>

<p>The Python language had a humble beginning in the late 1980s when a Dutchman Guido Von Rossum started working on a fun project, which would be a successor to ABC language with better exception handling and capability to interface with OS Amoeba at Centrum Wiskunde and Informatica. It first appeared in 1991. Python 2.0 was released in the year 2000 and Python 3.0 was released in the year 2008. The language was named Python after the famous British television comedy show Monty Python's Flying Circus, which was one of Guido's favorite television programmes. Here we will see why Python has suddenly influenced our lives and the various applications that use Python and its implementations. In this chapter, you will be learning the basic installation steps that are required to perform on different platforms (that is Windows, Linux, and Mac), about environment variables, setting up of environment variables, file formats, Python interactive shell, basic syntaxes and finally printing out formatted output.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Why Python?</h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>Now you might be suddenly bogged with the question, why Python? According to &#160;<span>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 2016 ranking Python ranked third after C and Java. As per Indeed.com's data of 2016, the Python job market search ranked fifth. Clearly, all the data points to the ever rising demand in the job market for Python. Its a cool language if you want to learn just for fun or if you want to build your career around Python, you will adore the language. At school level, many schools have started including Python programming for kids. With new technologies taking the market by surprise Python has been playing a dominant role. Whether it is cloud platform, mobile app development, BigData, IoT with Raspberry Pi, or the new Blockchain technology, Python is being seen as a niche language platform to develop and deliver a scalable and robust applications.</span></p>
<p>Some key features of the language are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python programs can run on any platform, you can carry code created in Windows machine and run it on Mac or Linux</li>
<li>Python has inbuilt large library with prebuilt and portable functionality, also known as the standard library</li>
<li>Python is an expressive language</li>
<li>Python is free and open source</li>
<li>Python code is&#160;about one third of the size of equivalent C++ and Java code</li>
<li>Python can be both dynamically and strongly typed--dynamically typed means it is a type of variable that is interpreted at runtime, which&#160;means, in Python, there is no need to define the type (<kbd>int</kbd>&#160;or&#160;<kbd>float</kbd>) of the variable</li>
</ul>

<p>Python 2.x&#160;can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">https://www.python.org/downloads</a>. The installer is simple and easy to install. Perform the following&#160;steps to install the setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once you click on setup installer, you will get a small window on your desktop screen as shown here; click on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:</li>

<p>These days most of the Linux-based systems come preloaded with Python, so in most cases, you do not need to install it separately. However, if you do not find your desired version of Python on the Linux platform, you can download your desired version for a particular Linux platform from the site&#160;<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/source/">https://www.python.org/downloads/source/</a>. Perform&#160;the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract the compressed file using the&#160;<kbd>tar -xvzf python_versionx.x</kbd>&#160;command.</li>
<li>Browse the directory of the compressed file as shown in the screenshot:</li>

                <h1 class="header-title">Installation on Mac OS</h1>
            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>For Mac OS, you will get the installer from the site <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/</a>.&#160;</p>
<p>For the new Mac OS X, Sierra comes loaded with Python 2.7 and it's good for learning but the same cannot be used to develop advanced-level programs. You do not need to separately install Python on the new Mac OS X. However, a word of caution is that the version of Python packed with the Mac OS could be out of date and might require updating. If you still want to install a separate version, you can follow the simple steps mentioned as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, you might require to install Xcode, Xcode is the IDE for &#160;platform and can be downloaded from the Apple appstore.</li>
<li>Once Xcode is installed, you need to install the command-line tools, which can be installed by running the&#160;<kbd>xcode-select --install</kbd> command on the terminal found under <kbd>/Applications/Utilities/</kbd>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="44" width="382" class="image-border" src="images/image-6-1.jpg"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>&#160;A pop-up window appears with three different options as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/image-7.jpg"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Once you click on&#160;<span class="packt_screen">Install</span> and agree to their terms and conditions, the command-line tools will start to download and will be installed in few minutes depending on the Internet connection.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>The next step in the process would be to install Homebrew, which is a package manager for Mac OS and handles the Python package. In order to install Homebrew, simply provide the following inputs to the terminal:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><strong>      /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL</strong><br/><strong>      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</strong>
</pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>To install the latest <kbd>python2</kbd> version, simply type <kbd>brew install python</kbd> on the terminal:</li>
</ol>
<pre><strong>      $ brew install python</strong>
</pre>
<div class="packt_infobox">In order to install <kbd>python3</kbd>, you need&#160;to use <kbd>brew install python3</kbd>.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>Python interactive shell is also known as <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDLE</strong>). With the Python installer, two interactive shells are provided: one is IDLE (Python GUI) and the other is Python (command line). Both can be used for running simple programs.</p>
<p>For complex programs and executing large files, the windows command prompt is used, where after the system variables are set automatically, large files are recognized and executed by the system.</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/Capture6-1.jpg"/></div>
<p>The preceding screenshot&#160;is what we call Python IDLE, which comes bundled with the Python installation. The next screenshot&#160;is of the command line that also comes bundled with the Python installation, or we can simply launch the Python command through the windows command line and get Python command line. For most of our programming instructions, we will be using the Python command line:</p>

<p>If you remember the installation steps explained earlier, you might be still thinking what are system variables? They are a set of predefined variables, which are available to all programming units. If it's not set, then each and every time you want to run your program or execute a Python file, you will have to manually provide path for each Python executable, but if <kbd>python.exe</kbd> is set as a system variable, then the system automatically recognizes your programming instruction and starts executing.</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="images/Capture9.jpg"/></div>
<p>During installation, the installer provides an option to set system variables, which we have seen in our installation steps. But in case you missed that out, you need not worry. You can manually set the system variables. Simply follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just right-click on <span class="packt_screen">My Computer (older version of Windows PC)</span>&#160;or Computer (win 7 onwards) and select <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span>.

<p>Congratulations on your successful installation. Now you can start programming. Open Notepad++ and create a new file. In the new file, type the following:</p>
<pre>print "Hello World!" 
</pre>
<p>Save the file as <kbd>hello.py</kbd>.</p>
<p>Open the command prompt and traverse to the folder where your file is located using <kbd>cd</kbd> and then the path of the folder. For executing the file, the command will be <kbd>python hello.py</kbd>&#160;as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Basic syntaxes can be referred to as simple guidelines that every programming language requires. Let's try to understand from our daily lives. Let's say you can't eat your food without having it dressed and placed properly on the platter. You need to have proper dressing of food before you can consume it.&#160;You prepare a special drink comprising three&#160;measures of Gordon gin, one of vodka, half of Kina Lillet, and follow the process to mix in steps. The process is necessary to have a perfect blend. These are sort of syntaxes when we talk in terms of programming languages.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Kina Lillet-Lillet <span>(French pronunciation: [li'le]), classed as an</span> aromatized wine <span>within EU law, is a French</span> aperitif <span>wine from Podensac, a small village south of Bordeaux. It is a blend of 85% Bordeaux region wines (Semillon for the Blanc and for the Rosé, Merlot for the Rouge) and 15%</span> macerated <span>liqueurs, mostly citrus liqueurs (peels of sweet oranges from Spain and Morocco and peels of bitter green oranges from Haiti). The mix is then stirred in oak vats until blended. During the aging process, Lillet is handled as a Bordeaux wine (undergoing fining, racking, filtering, and so on).<br/></span>The preceding information has been taken from&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillet">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillet</a>.</div>

            <article>
                
<p>In Python, there are two types of comments--one is a single-line comment and the other is multiline comment. For a single-line comment,&#160;<kbd>#</kbd> is used, while for a multiline comment, triple quotes <kbd>"""</kbd> are used:</p>
<pre>#This is a single line comment in Python<br/><br/>print "Hello World" #This is a single comment in Python<br/><br/>""" For multi-line<br/>comment use three<br/>double quotes<br/>...<br/>"""<br/>print "Hello World!"

            </header>

            <article>
                
<p>Python doesn't care if you use single quotes or double quotes to print a single statement. But, surely, both has some significance while printing complex statements, which we will see soon.</p>
<p><kbd>print "Hello World!"</kbd>&#160;and&#160;<kbd>print 'Hello World!'</kbd> will give the same output <kbd>Hello World!</kbd> two times:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="298" width="599" class="image-border" src="images/image18.jpg"/></div>
<p>How will you print something like this:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">I am mad in love&#160; do you think&#160;&#160;I am doing the right thing? One way is to enclose the complete thing within the triple quotes as shown here:</div>
<pre>print '''I am mad in love<br/>                     do you think<br/>                                 I am doing<br/>                                           the right thing '''
</pre>
<p>Alternatively,&#160;you can also use double quotes three times to achieve the same thing:</p>
<pre>print """I am mad in love<br/>                     do you think<br/>                                 I am doing<br/>                                                                                                                             the right thing """
</pre>
<div class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign packt_infobox">The preceding two examples are not in formatted form, they are just to show how we can achieve multiline printing.</div>
<p>Let's try another example. What should be the outcome of the following statement?</p>
<pre>print 'Hey there it's a cow'
</pre>
<p>The preceding piece of code gives the following results:</p>
<pre>C:pydev&gt;python hello.py<br/>File "hello.py", line 1<br/>print 'Hey there it's a cow'<br/>^<br/>SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</pre>
<p>Python simply interprets that the statement terminated with a single quote after it. The solution is to enclose the complete sentence within double quotes as shown:</p>
<pre>print "Hey there it's a cow"
</pre>
<p>Adding double quotes (<kbd>"</kbd>) gives an error-free output as shown:</p>
<pre>C:pydev&gt;python hello.py<br/>Hey there it's a cow
</pre>

            <article>
                
<p>The Python back slash is used for continuation of the&#160;<kbd>print</kbd> statement. You can stretch a single statement across multiple lines:</p>
<pre>print "Hello<br/>  world "
</pre>
<p>This gives the following output:</p>

            </header>

            <article>
                
<p><span>Consider an example where you would want to print the name, marks, and the age of the person:</span></p>
<pre><span class="syntex">print </span><span>"Name", "Marks", "Age" </span><br/><span class="syntex">print </span><span>"John Doe", 80.67, "27" </span><br/><span class="syntex">print </span><span>"Bhaskar", 76.908, "27"</span><br/><span class="syntex">print </span><span>"Mohit", 56.98, "25" </span>
</pre>
<p>The output will be as follows:</p>
<pre>C:pydev&gt;python hello.py<br/>Name Marks Age<br/>John Doe 80.67 27<br/>Bhaskar 76.908 27<br/>Mohit 56.98 25
</pre>
<p><span>You can see the output, but the output that is displayed is not formatted. Python allows you to set the formatted output. If you have done some coding in</span> C <span>language, then you should be familiar with</span> <kbd>%d</kbd>, <kbd>%f</kbd>, <kbd>%s</kbd>.&#160;<span>In order to represent an integer&#160;</span><kbd>%d</kbd> <span>is used,&#160;</span><kbd>%f</kbd><span>&#160;is used for float, and</span> <kbd>%s</kbd><span>&#160;is used for string. If you used <kbd>%5d</kbd>, it means 5 spaces. If you used <kbd>%5.2f</kbd>, it means <kbd>5</kbd> spaces and <kbd>.2</kbd> means precision. The decimal part of the number or the precision is set to 2. Let's use the formatting on the preceding example:</span></p>
<pre><span class="syntex">print </span><span>"Name Marks Age" </span><br/><span class="syntex">print </span><span>( "%s %14.2f %11d" % ("John Doe", 80.67, 27)) </span><br/><span class="syntex">print </span><span>( "%s %12.2f %11d" %("Bhaskar" ,76.901, 27))</span><br/><span class="syntex">print </span><span>( "%s %3.2f %11d" %("Mohit", 56.98, 25)) </span>
</pre>
<p>The output we get is as follows:</p>
<pre>C:pydev&gt;python hello.py<br/>Name Marks Age<br/>John Doe 80.67 27<br/>Bhaskar 76.90 27<br/>Mohit 56.98 25
</pre>
<p class="sech">The preceding output is much better than the previous one. You can see <kbd>Marks</kbd> <kbd>76.901</kbd> set to <kbd>76.90</kbd> automatically.</p>

            <article>
                
<div class="sech">
<p>The most unique characteristic of Python, unlike other programming languages, is indentation. Indentation not only makes Python code readable, but also distinguishes each block of code from the other. Let's explain this with an&#160;example:</p>
<pre>def fun():<br/>    pass<br/>for each in "Australia":<br/>    pass
</pre>
<p>While writing the code, a new block of code starts with a colon followed by a tab. Here, after the function&#160;<kbd>fun()</kbd>, a colon is provided which will start the function body, <kbd>pass</kbd> is part of the function&#160;<kbd>fun()</kbd> and it is placed at one tab space. Likewise, the for loop starts with a colon. Here, most people get confused whether to use a tab or space. It is advisable to stick to only one type and follow the same across the whole code. If the indentation is not strictly implemented, then code execution will throw an error.</p>

<p>So far, we did a walkthrough of the beginning and the brief history of Python. We looked through&#160;various implementations and flavors of Python. We also learned about installation on various platforms. We learned about basic syntaxes that are used in writing the code and also we learned about various escape sequences that would make writing the code simple. We finally learned about the importance of indentation in Python.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will see immutable data types.</p>

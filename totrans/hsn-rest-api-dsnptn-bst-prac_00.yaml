- en: This book is intended to empower you with knowledge of API design principles
    and best practices, such that you will be ready to design highly scalable, reusable,
    adaptable, and secured RESTful APIs. This book also introduces some common and
    some emerging patterns in the most indispensable domain of RESTful APIs.

- en: RESTful patterns impact various layers of web services that span across multiple
    functions, such as CRUD operations, databases, presentation layers, applications,
    and infrastructure layers. Other prominent and dominant patterns in the RESTful
    domain include communication, integration, orchestration, security, management,
    software deployment, and delivery. This book will help you become familiar with
    the most significant patterns, such as client/server discovery, API gateways,
    API compositions, circuit breakers, enterprise security, content negotiation,
    endpoint redirection, idempotent capability, API façades, and many more essential
    patterns.

    RESTful APIs, it covers a few basics of service-oriented architectures and resource-oriented
    web service architectures as well, to help you gain a better understanding of
    what's being covered more quickly.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ce158181-8265-4afb-b858-348cc775d6d8.xhtml), *Introduction to the
    Basics of RESTful Architecture*, intends to refresh your understanding of a few
    fundamental concepts of the web, its architecture, and the way it is evolving,
    hoping to lay a firm foundation for RESTful service designs and applications.
    We will discuss World Wide Web layers and architecture, web API development models,
    and REST-based service communications. You will also be introduced to service-oriented
    and resource-oriented architecture principles and characteristics, then move on
    to the foundations of REST''s principles, constraints, qualifiers, and goals.'

    Guidelines, and Best Practices*, discusses a few essential API design guidelines,
    such as consistency, standardization, reusability, and accessibility through REST
    interfaces, aiming to equip API designers with better thought processes for their
    API modelling. Also, this chapter intends to introduce a few practices for better
    REST API implementations, along with a few common, but avoidable, mistakes of
    API strategies.'

    API Patterns*, provides both information about the concepts and also practical
    code examples to do with common and fundamental design patterns of RESTful APIs,
    so that you can better understand and power your RESTful API services. As part
    of this chapter, you will learn a few common and essential API design patterns,
    such as content negotiation, URI templates, pagination, Unicode, and more, along
    with the code implementation of those patterns. Each pattern addresses the RESTful
    constraints, and helps you to ensure that these essential patterns are accounted
    for in your API designs and implementations.'

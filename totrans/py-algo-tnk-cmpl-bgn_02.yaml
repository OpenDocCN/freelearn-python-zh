- en: The book you hold in your hands follows the spiral curriculum teaching approach,
    a method proposed in 1960 by Jerome Bruner, an American psychologist. According
    to this method, as a subject is being taught, basic ideas are revisited at intervals—at
    a more sophisticated level each time—until the reader achieves a complete understanding
    of the subject. First, the reader learns the basic elements without worrying about
    the details. Later, more details are taught and basic elements are mentioned again
    and again, eventually being stored in the brain's long term memory.

    experimentation, exploration, and discovery. This book contains many examples,
    most of which can be practically performed. This gives the readers the opportunity
    to get their hands on Python and become capable of creating their own programs.

    introduction to programming, assuming no prior knowledge of the subject. It is

    foundation in Algorithmic Thinking—the fundamental skill every aspiring programmer
    must acquire. Algorithmic Thinking encompasses more than just writing code; it
    entails mastering the art of problem-solving through coding.

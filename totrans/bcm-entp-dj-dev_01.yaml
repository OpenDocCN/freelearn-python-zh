- en: In this part, you will begin by learning what enterprise development is, understanding
    the requirements gathering process, and creating a free hosting plan with Heroku.
    You will create a local, development, staging, and production environment for
    the code to live and run in. You will then create a Django project and push that
    code to those environments.

- en: We will discuss configuring the project files and settings to work with a Heroku-hosted
    app. We will also create and configure a database to work with the project we
    are building. Then, we will build models that relate to the tables within that
    database. Heroku is not necessary for the rest of the book. The majority of this
    book can run locally on your machine.

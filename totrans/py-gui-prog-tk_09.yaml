    a Pillow `Image` object from the file. `Image.open()` is a convenience method
    that simply takes a filename or path and returns an `Image` object containing
    that file's image data. Next, we create a Tkinter `PhotoImage` object by passing
    the `Image` object to `ImageTk.PhotoImage()`. Finally, we update our `image_display`
    widget with the new `PhotoImage` object.

    that inherits all the traits of the custom, while adding or overriding its own.
    In other words, if we were to create a style called `Error.RecordInfo.TLabel`,
    it would inherit all the properties of `RecordInfo.TLabel` but allow us to make

    Then, we call `Style.configure()` to set the text color of our new style to a
    dark red. Note that we don't give the `Style` object a name here; since we're
    only making one change, it's OK to just call `configure()` directly on the created
    object and then let the object get thrown away.

    issue, but for our color-blind users in particular, the improvement is subtle
    at best, if it's even noticeable. We can use our knowledge of styling to take
    things a bit farther, though. Rather than just changing the color of the text,
    let's invert the colors of the input so that we have light text on a dark background.

    previously implemented a `_toggle_error()` method that sets the foreground color
    to red when the widget is invalid on focus-out. We could update that command to
    apply a different style to the widget instead, so that the background color would
    change as well. However, there's a better way.
  prefs: []

    state when validation fails, and that Ttk styles can have colors and other properties
    tied to different widget states by means of a style map. Rather than explicitly
    changing styles or colors when validation fails, we can create a style map that
    changes colors automatically in response to a failed validation.

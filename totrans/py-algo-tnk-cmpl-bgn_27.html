<p class="my_basic">In contrast to the single-alternative decision structure, this type of decision control structure includes a statement or block of statements on both paths.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width33" src="img/chapter17-01.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">If Boolean_Expression evaluates to True, the statement or block of statements 1 is executed; otherwise, the statement or block of statements 2 is executed.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The general form of the Python statement is</p>
<div><p>if Boolean_Expression:</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements 1</p></div>
<p>else:</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements 2</p></div>

<p class="my_basic">In the next example, the message “You are an adult” is displayed when the user enters a value greater than or equal to 18. The message “You are underage!”  is displayed otherwise.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">Exercise 17.1-1 Finding the Output Message</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">For the following flowchart, determine the output message for three different executions.</p>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">The input values for the three executions are: (i) 3, (ii) −3, and (iii) 0.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width31" src="img/chapter17-02.png"/></p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p>i)When the user enters the value 3, the Boolean expression evaluates to True. The flow of execution follows the right path and the message “Positive” is displayed.</p>
<p>ii)When the user enters the value −3, the Boolean expression evaluates to False. The flow of execution follows the left path and the message “Negative” is displayed.</p>
<p>iii)Can you predict what happens when the user enters the value 0? If you believe that none of the messages will be displayed, you are wrong! The dual-alternative decision structure must always follow a path, either the right or the left! It cannot skip the execution of both of its blocks of statements. At least one statement or block of statements must be executed. So, in this case, when the user enters the value 0, the Boolean expression evaluates to False, the flow of execution follows the left path, and the message “Negative” is displayed!</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>This algorithm, as it stands, does not satisfy the property of effectiveness for all possible inputs. While it correctly identifies positive and negative values, it overlooks the case of zero. Zero is a valid input and should be accounted for in the algorithm's logic to ensure it produces a meaningful result for all potential inputs. Later in this book (in <a href="chapter19.html#toc_3">Exercise 19.1-2</a>), you will learn how to display three messages, depending on whether the user-provided value is greater than, less than, or equal to zero.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Design a flowchart and write the corresponding Python program that lets the user enter two numbers A and B and then determines and displays the greater of the two numbers.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">This exercise can be solved using either the dual- or single-alternative decision structure.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Using a dual-alternative decision structure</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach tests if the value of number B is greater than that of number A. If so, number B is the greatest; otherwise, number A is the greatest. The corresponding flowchart for solving this exercise using this approach is presented below</p>

</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Using a single-alternative decision structure</p>
<p class="my_basic">As presented in the following flowchart, this approach initially assumes that number A is likely the greatest value (this is why it assigns the value of variable a to variable maximum). However, if it turns out that number B is greater than number A, then the greatest value is updated; variable maximum is assigned a new value—the value of variable b. Thus, irrespective of the values of numbers A and B, in the end, variable maximum will always contain the greatest value!</p>

<p>4)Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number, and then displays a message indicating whether the user-provided number is greater than 100. It must display “Provided number is less than or equal to 100” otherwise.</p>
<p>5)Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number, and then displays a message indicating whether the user-provided number is between 0 and 100. It must display “Provided number is not between 0 and 100” otherwise.</p>
<p>6)Two football teams play against each other in the UEFA Champions League. Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the names of the two teams and the goals that each team scored, and then displays the name of the winner. Assume that the user enters valid values and there is no tie (draw).</p>
<p>7)Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that lets the user enter an integer, and then displays a message indicating whether the user-provided number is a multiple of 6; it must display “NN is not a multiple of 6” otherwise (where NN is the user-provided number). Assume that the user enters a non-negative<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_14" id="Link_To_Endnote_14">[14]</a></sup> value.</p>
<p>8)Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that lets the user enter an integer, and then displays one of two possible messages. One message indicates if the user-provided number is a multiple of 6 or a multiple of 7; the other message indicates if the user-provided number is neither a multiple of 6 nor a multiple of 7. Assume that the user enters a non-negative value.</p>
<p>9)Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that lets the user enter an integer. The program must then display a message indicating whether the user-provided number is a multiple of 4; it must display “NN is not a multiple of 4” otherwise (where NN is the user-provided number). Additionally, the program must present the structure of the user-provided integer as “NN = QQ x 4 + RR”, where QQ is the integer quotient, and RR is the integer remainder when NN is divided by 4. For example, if the user-provided integer is 14, the message “14 = 3 x 4 + 2” must be displayed. Assume that the user enters a non-negative value.</p>
<p>10)Using a dual-alternative decision structure, design a flowchart and write the corresponding Python program that lets the user enter two values, and then determines and displays the smaller of the two values. Assume that the user enters two different values.</p>
<p>11)Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that lets the user enter three numbers, and then displays a message indicating whether the user-provided numbers can be lengths of the three sides of a triangle; it must display “Provided numbers cannot be lengths of the three sides of a triangle” otherwise. Assume that the user enters valid values.</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">Hint: In any triangle, the length of each side is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.</p>
<p>12)Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that lets the user enter three numbers, and then displays a message indicating whether the user-provided numbers can be lengths of the three sides of a right triangle (or right-angled triangle); it must display “Provided numbers cannot be lengths of the three sides of a right triangle” otherwise.

<p>13)Athletes in the long jump at the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004 participated in three different qualifying jumps. An athlete, in order to qualify, has to achieve an average jump distance of at least 8 meters. Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the three performances, and then displays the message “Qualified” when the average value is greater than or equal to 8 meters; it displays “Disqualified” otherwise. Assume that the user enters valid values.</p>
<p>14)Gross pay depends on the pay rate and the total number of hours worked per week. However, if someone works more than 40 hours, they get paid double for all hours worked over 40. Using a dual-alternative decision structure, design a flowchart and write the corresponding Python program that lets the user enter the pay rate and hours worked and then calculates and displays net pay. Net pay is the amount of pay that is actually paid to the employee after any deductions. Deductions include taxes, health insurance, retirement plans, on so on. Assume a total deduction of 30%. Also, assume that the user enters valid values.</p>
<p>15)Regular servicing will keep your vehicle more reliable, reducing the chance of breakdowns, inconvenience and unnecessary expenses. In general, there are two types of service you need to perform:</p>
<p>a)a minor service every 6000 miles</p>
<p>b)a major service every 12000 miles</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the miles traveled, and then calculates and displays how many miles are left until the next service, as well as the type of the next service.

<p>16)Two cars start from rest and move with a constant acceleration along a straight horizontal road for a specified time. Using a dual-alternative decision structure, write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the time the two cars traveled (same for both cars) and the acceleration for each one of them, and then calculates and displays the distance between them as well as a message “Car A is first” or “Car B is first” depending on which car is leading the race.

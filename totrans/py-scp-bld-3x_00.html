<p>Blender is a free, open source application for 3D modeling and animation. It has evolved over the years and, since version 3.0, is on par with state-of-the-art software in many aspects.</p>
<p>It provides a Python <strong class="bold">Application Programming Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">API</strong>) for automating tasks, adding functionalities, and integrating Blender in large productions.</p>
<p>Python is a free, open source programming language for quick yet powerful scripting. Its syntax, akin to simplified English, automatic memory management, and ease of integration, makes it the standard in software APIs and 3D pipelines.</p>
<p>This book goes through the steps of the 3D process, starting with the creation and manipulation of objects, then animation and deformation follow, with rendering as the closing chapter. Though this order is a linear path, every chapter can stand on its own, with the exception perhaps of <a href="B18375_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, and <a href="B18375_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, which rely on examples introduced in their immediate predecessor.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for users of Blender who want to expand their skills and learn to script, technical directors who want to automate laborious tasks, and professionals and hobbyists who want to learn more about the Python architecture of Blender.</p>

<p><a href="B18375_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor304"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Rendering and Shaders</em>, teaches you how color and material information is applied to objects and how that process can be automated.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>The examples in this book were written and tested using Blender version 3.3. Version 3.3 is a long-term support release and can be found on most application platforms, besides being available for free at <a href="https://Blender.org">Blender.org</a>.</p>
<p>Using a programmer text editor is advised. Microsoft Visual Studio Code 1.70, a lightweight free editor available on most operating systems, is used in this book, but any other editor can be used.</p>
<p>More instructions on how to install the software are provided in <a href="B18375_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>.</p>
<p>The scripts contained in the book were written with forward compatibility in mind. The code available online will be updated to accommodate changes in future releases.</p>
<p>It is assumed that you have some experience with Blender and at least a basic understanding of how Python works, but special effort was put into keeping those requirements low and providing explanations for every concept used in this book.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Conventions used</h1>
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “The <code>fcurve.modifiers.new(type)</code> method creates a new modifier according to the type provided in the argument. It returns the new modifier.”</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
bl_info = {
    "name": "<code>Object Shaker</code>",    "author": "Packt Man",    "version": (1, 0),    "blender": (3, 00, 0),    "description": "Add Shaky motion to active object",    "location": "<code>Object Right Click -&gt; Add Object Shake</code>",    "category": "Learning",
}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sin((frame / <code>fps</code>) * <code>length</code>/9.8)))</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
['ASSETBROWSER_MT_context_menu',...['VIEW3D_MT_edit_metaball_context_menu', 'VIEW3D_MT_gpencil_edit_context_menu', 'VIEW3D_MT_object_context_menu', 'VIEW3D_MT_particle_context_menu',...</pre>
<p>Some of the code is meant to be used as input for the interactive Python Console. In that case, the user input is preceded by the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt, unlike the console output:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hello")
Hello</pre>
<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “Before we delve into how f-modifiers are scripted, we will have a look at how to create them in <strong class="bold">Graph Editor</strong>.”</p>

- en: Building your own Python web applications provides you with the opportunity
    to have great functionality, with no restrictions. However, creating web applications
    with Python is not straightforward. Coupled with learning a new skill of developing
    web applications, you would normally have to learn how to work with a framework
    as well.

    build your own web application that is easy to use, performs smoothly, and is
    themed to your taste all without having to learn another web framework.'

- en: Web development can take time and is often fiddly to get right. This book will
    show you how to design and implement a complex program from start to finish. Each
    chapter looks at a different type of web application, meaning that you will learn
    about a wide variety of features and how to add them to your customized web application.
    You will also learn to implement jQuery into your web application to give it extra
    functionality. By using the right combination of a wide range of tools, you can
    have a fully functional, complex web application up and running in no time.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Choosing Your Tools"), *Choosing Your Tools*,
    looks at the many aspects of designing web applications. The idea is to provide
    you with an overview that may help you recognize components in subsequent chapters
    and give you some insight into the arguments used to decide which tool or library
    to use. We also illustrate some issues that are relevant when designing an application
    that does not deal with coding directly, such as security or usability.'

    a Simple Spreadsheet*, develops a simple spreadsheet application. The spreadsheet
    functionality will be entirely implemented in JavaScript plus jQuery UI, but on
    the server-side, we will encounter the application server, CherryPy, for the first
    time and we will extend it with Python code to deliver the page that contains
    the spreadsheet application dynamically.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Tasklist I: Persistence"), *Tasklist I: Persistence*,
    a full fledged web application needs functionality to store information on the
    server and a way to identify different users. In this chapter, we address both
    issues as we develop a simple application to maintain lists of tasks.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Tasklist II: Databases and AJAX"), *Tasklist
    II: Databases and AJAX*, refactors the tasklist application developed in the previous
    chapter. We will use the SQLite database engine on the server to store items and
    will use jQuery''s AJAX functionality to dynamically update the contents of the
    web application. On the presentation side, we will encounter jQuery UI''s event
    system and will learn how to react on mouse clicks.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Entities and Relations"), *Entities and Relations*,
    most real life applications sport more than one entity and often many of these
    entities are related. Modeling these relations is one of the strong points of
    a relational database. In this chapter, we will develop a simple framework to
    manage these entities and use this framework to build an application to maintain
    lists of books for multiple users.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Building a Wiki"), *Building a Wiki*, develops
    a wiki application and in doing so we focus on two important concepts in building
    web applications. The first one is the design of the data layer. The wiki application
    is quite complex, and in this chapter, we try to see where the limitations in
    our simple framework lie. The second one is input validation. Any application
    that accepts input from all over the Internet should check the data it receives,
    and in this chapter, we look at both client-side and server-side input validation.'

    Code for Reuse*, after doing a substantial bit of work, it is often a good idea
    to take a step back and look critically at your own work to see if things could
    have been done better. In this chapter, we look at ways to make the entity framework
    more generally useful and employ it to implement the books application a second
    time.'

    Customer Relations*, there is more to an entity framework and CherryPy application
    code than merely browsing lists. The user must be able to add new instances and
    edit existing ones. This chapter is the start of the development of a CRM application
    that will be extended and refined in the final chapters.'

    Instances"), *Creating Full-Fledged Webapps: Implementing Instances*, focuses
    on the design and implementation of the user interface components to add and maintain
    entities, and relations between entities, in a way that is independent of the
    type of entity. This functionality is immediately put to use in the CRM application
    that we develop. Managing user privileges is another issue we encounter as we
    explore the concept of role-based access control.'

    the CRM Application*, is the final chapter and it extends our framework and thereby
    our CRM application by taking a look at browsing, filtering, and sorting large
    numbers of entities. We also take a look at what is needed to allow customization
    by the end user of the application''s appearance and its functionality.'

    were tested on Firefox 3 and Internet Explorer 8, but any moderately recent versions
    of these browsers will probably work just as well, as will Chrome. The Firebug
    extension for Firefox, however, is a superior tool to debug the client-side of
    web applications, so you might want to try it if you have not done so already.
    Appendix A provides links to the necessary resources.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Moderately experienced Python programmers who want to learn how to create fairly
    complex, database-driven, cross browser compatible web applications that are maintainable
    and look good, will find this book of most use. All applications in the book are
    developed in Python 3, but experience with Python 2.x is sufficient to understand
    all examples. JavaScript plays an important supporting role in many of the example
    applications and some introductory level knowledge of JavaScript might be useful,
    but is not strictly necessary because the focus is mainly on Python development
    and the JavaScript code is used either as building blocks or explained in such
    detail that anyone comfortable with Python should be able to understand it.

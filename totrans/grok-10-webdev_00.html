Grok is one of the many that are written in the Python programming language, but it may be one of the least known. This book is a step towards getting the word out that Grok can be a very good fit for many kinds of web development projects.</p><p>For one thing, Grok is based on a body of software known as the Zope Toolkit (ZTK), which is a huge set of libraries that are used for web development in Python. The ZTK is itself the result of more than ten years of work that started with the Zope web framework, which was one of the very first Python web frameworks.</p><p>Grok is also a modern web framework, which means, it has also learned from the innovations of popular web frameworks such as Django or Ruby on Rails. All in all, as we go through the book, you will find Grok as a framework that is agile enough for small applications, yet powerful enough for really complex projects.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec01"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>Chapter 1,<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting to Know Grok"> Getting to Know Grok</a>, goes into what makes Grok an attractive option for Python web development. You'll learn how Grok makes use of the Zope Toolkit and why this makes Grok powerful and flexible. Then some of Grok's most important concepts will be introduced. Finally, you'll briefly see how Grok compares to other web development frameworks.</p><p>Chapter 2,<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started with Grok"> Getting Started with Grok</a>, shows you how to install Python on different platforms, in case you are new to it. You'll learn what the Python Package Index (PyPI) is and how to work with EasyInstall to quickly install packages from it over the network. Next, you'll create and run your first project using a tool called grokproject.</p><p>Chapter 3,<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Views"> Views</a>, explains what views are and where in the Grok application code should they be defined. For templating, Grok uses the ZPT templating language, so you'll learn how to use it and see examples of the most common statements in action. To test this knowledge, we'll see how to write a full Grok application using only views. Other topics covered include how to get form parameters from a web request, how to add static resources to a Grok application, and how to create and work with additional views.</p><p>Chapter 4,<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Models"> Models</a>, introduces the concept of models and what relationship they have with views. Among other key topics, you'll learn how to persist model data on the ZODB and how to structure your code to maintain the separation of display logic from application logic. Next, we'll see what a container is and how to use one. Finally, we'll explain how to use multiple models and associate specific views to each.</p><p>Chapter 5,<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Forms"> Forms</a>, will start with a quick demonstration of automatic forms. We'll briefly touch the concepts of interface and schema and show how they are used to generate forms automatically. Among other things, you'll learn how to filter fields and prevent them from appearing in a form, and how to change form templates and presentation.</p><p>Chapter 6,<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. The Catalog: An Object-Oriented Search Engine"> The Catalog: An Object-Oriented Search Engine</a>, will discuss how to search for specific objects in the database using a tool called the catalog. We'll cover what a catalog is and how it works, what indexes are and how they work, and how to store data in the catalog. Next, we'll learn how to perform simple queries on the catalog and how to use that knowledge to create a search interface for our application.</p><p>Chapter 7,<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Security"> Security</a>, will cover authentication and authorization. Grok security is based on the concepts of principals (users), permissions, and roles. It has a default security policy, which you'll learn to modify. Grok has a pluggable authentication system, which allows us to set up custom security policies. We'll create one and learn how to manage users as well.</p><p>Chapter 8,<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Application Presentation and Page Layout"> Application Presentation and Page Layout</a>, deals with Grok's layout and presentation machinery that is based on the concept of viewlets. We'll learn what viewlet managers and viewlets are and how to define a layout using them. Then we'll cover the concepts of layers and skins, which allow Grok applications to be delivered with alternative presentations and styles. Finally, we'll define an alternative skin for the application.</p><p>Chapter 9,<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Grok and the ZODB"> Grok and the ZODB</a>, tells us more about the ZODB, including how to take advantage of its other features, such as blob handling. We'll also learn a bit about ZODB maintenance and the need to pack the database frequently. Finally, we'll try our hand at using the ZODB as a regular Python library, outside Grok.</p><p>Chapter 10,<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Grok and Relational Databases"> Grok and Relational Databases</a>, will help us find out what facilities Grok has for relational database access. Here are some specific things that we will cover why is it important that Grok allows developers to use relational databases easily, what an Object Relational Mapper is, how to use SQLAlchemy with Grok, and how to change our authentication mechanism to use a relational database instead of the ZODB.</p><p>Chapter 11,<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Key Concepts Behind Grok"> Key Concepts Behind Grok</a>, goes into a little more depth with the main concepts behind the Zope Component Architecture, a pillar of Grok. We'll start by explaining the main ZCA concepts, such as interfaces, adapters, and utilities, using the code from the last ten chapters for illustration. We'll learn about one of the main benefits of the ZCA, by using some of its patterns to extend our application. Most importantly, we'll cover how to extend a package without touching its code.</p><p>Chapter 12,<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Grokkers, Martian, and Agile Configuration"> Grokkers, Martian, and Agile Configuration</a>, will introduce grokkers. A grokker is a piece of code that allows developers to use framework functionality by making declarations in the code instead of using configuration files. Grok uses a library called Martian to create its own grokkers and we'll see how to create our own as well.</p><p>Chapter 13,<a class="link" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Testing and Debugging"> Testing and Debugging</a>, comments briefly on the importance of testing and then explains how to do testing in Grok. We'll start with extending the functional test suite provided by grokproject and then go on to other kinds of testing. Finally, we'll cover some debugging tools, including live web debuggers.</p><p>Chapter 14,<a class="link" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Deployment"> Deployment</a>, discusses how to deploy our application by using the standard paster server. Then, we'll find out how to run the application behind Apache, first by using a simple proxy configuration, and then under mod_wsgi. Finally, we'll explore how ZEO provides horizontal scalability for our application, and will briefly discuss how to make a site support high traffic loads by adding caching and load balancing into the mix.</p></div></div></div>

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea of this book came to me from the nice people at Packt Publishing. They
    wanted someone who could delve into the intricacies of high performance in Python
    and everything related to this subject, be it profiling, the available tools (such
    as profilers and other performance enhancement techniques), or even alternatives
    to the standard Python implementation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having said that, I welcome you to *Mastering Python High Performance*. In this
    book, we'll cover everything related to performance improvements. Knowledge about
    the subject is not strictly required (although it won't hurt), but knowledge of
    the Python programming language is required, especially in some of the Python-specific
    chapters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll start by going through the basics of what profiling is, how it fits into
    the development cycle, and the benefits related to including this practice in
    it. Afterwards, we'll move on to the core tools required to get the job done (profilers
    and visual profilers). Then, we will take a look at a set of optimization techniques
    and finally arrive at a fully practical chapter that will provide a real-life
    optimization example.

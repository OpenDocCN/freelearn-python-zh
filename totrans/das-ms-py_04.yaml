    and data. In this chapter, we're going to look at some rather simple things we
    can do that will make our lives as Python programmers simpler overall. We'll switch
    gears and look at version control, which will help us to collaborate with other
    programmers and serve as an undo buffer for the whole lifetime of a project. We're
    going to look at Python's built-in virtual environment tool, venv, which allows
    us to keep our programs and dependencies separate from each other and the software
    installed on our overall system.

    from docstrings by actually executing the examples we include in our documentation
    and making sure they agree with what the code actually does.

    as a popup, tooltip, or otherwise presented as a quick reference. The text after
    the blank line is presented when detailed documentation is requested. The docstring
    processing tools are smart about indentation, so it's safe and encouraged to indent
    our docstrings, so that they match up with the rest of the code block that they're
    describing.

    Sphinx comes into play.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sphinx is a tool that can process Python source code and standalone documentation
    files and generate nicely formatted documentation in a number of formats, notably
    HTML. Sphinx, like other Python documentation tools, recognizes a markup language
    called `reStructuredText`, which is intentionally readable and informative, even
    when its markup is presented as plaintext rather than being interpreted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`reStructuredText` can be found at the following link: [https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#reStructuredText-primer](https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#reStructuredText-primer).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: reStructuredText documents are still readable in a simple text editor, but when
    we feed them through a tool such as Sphinx they make the end result richer. The
    reStructuredText syntax is based on the conventions that developed on the internet
    before actual rich text was widely available in email and real-time chat.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, for example, words are emphasized by putting an asterisk (`*text*`) at each
    end and emphasized further by making that into two asterisks (`**text**`). Paragraphs
    are marked by placing a blank line between them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are syntaxes for lists, headings, and so on, all plainly readable in text
    mode. The syntax is nicely described in the Python developer's guide, but we're
    going to concentrate on a few bits of markup that do a lot to enhance the documentation
    for modules and packages. We actually saw one of those bits of markup earlier.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When our docstrings make reference to a local variable, such as a function parameter,
    that reference should be enclosed in asterisks to emphasize it and make it distinct
    from the normal text of the documentation. The names of modules, classes, functions,
    methods, attributes, exceptions, global variables, and constants should all be
    marked properly, so that Sphinx can cross-reference them and create links to their
    documentation.

    extra information, which isn't necessary, but often is helpful.

    asks us whether we want. It's also possible to integrate doctests into a test
    suite for Python's standard unit test library, or to use an integrated test runner
    called nos to find an excuse to execute them; doctests directly will do for our
    purposes in such cases, though.

    Believe it or not, this is a very good thing. I don't mean that having an error
    is a good thing, but that error was there whether we found it or not. Finding
    it and having a test on hand that will let us check whether we've succeeded in
    fixing it, though, is definitely good.

<h3 id="toc_1">10.1 What is the Sequence Control Structure?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Sequence control structure refers to the line-by-line execution by which statements are executed sequentially, in the same order in which they appear in the program, without skipping any of them. They might, for example, carry out a series of read or write operations, arithmetic operations, or assignments to variables.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following program shows an example of Python statements that are executed sequentially.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_10.1</div>
<div><p>#Prompt the user to enter value for num</p>
<p>num = int(input("Enter a number: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Calculate the square of num</p>
<p>result = num ** 2</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Display the result on user's screen</p>
<p>print("The square of", num, "is", result)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The sequence control structure is the simplest of the three fundamental control structures that you learned about in <a href="chapter04.html#toc_12">Section 4.11</a>. The other two structures are “decision structure” and “loop structure”. All problems in computer programming can be solved using only these three structures!</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>In Python, you can add comments using the hash character ( # ). Comments are for human readers. Compilers and interpreters ignore them.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the length of the base and the height of a rectangle, and then calculates and displays its area.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">You probably know from school that you can calculate the area of a rectangle using the following formula:</p>
<p class="my_basic center">Area = Base × Height</p>
<p class="my_basic">In <a href="chapter04.html#toc_6">Section 4.6</a>, you learned about the three main stages involved in creating an algorithm: data input, data processing, and results output.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, these three main stages are as follows:</p>
<p>►Data input – the user must enter values for Base and Height</p>
<p>►Data processing – the program must calculate the area of the rectangle</p>
<p>►Results output – the program must display the area of the rectangle calculated in the previous stage.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The solution to this problem is shown here.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that calculates and displays the area of a circle.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">You can calculate the area of a circle using the following formula:</p>
<p class="my_basic center">Area = π · Radius<sup>2</sup></p>
<p class="my_basic">The value of π is a known quantity, which is approximately 3.14159. Therefore, the only value the user must enter is the value for Radius.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">A car starts from rest and moves with a constant acceleration along a straight horizontal road for a specified time. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the acceleration and the time the car traveled, and then calculates and displays the distance traveled. The required formula is</p>

<p>►a is the acceleration, in meters per second<sup>2</sup> (m/sec<sup>2</sup>)</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that converts a temperature value from degrees Fahrenheit<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_8" id="Link_To_Endnote_8">[8]</a></sup> to its degrees Kelvin<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_9" id="Link_To_Endnote_9">[9]</a></sup> equivalent. The required formula is</p>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings center">1.8 × Kelvin = Fahrenheit + 459.67</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The formula given cannot be used in your program as is. In a computer language such as Python, it is not permitted to write</p>

<p class="my_basic">According to the wording of this exercise, the program must convert degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Kelvin. The value for degrees Fahrenheit is a known value and it is provided by the user, whereas the value for degrees Kelvin is what the Python program must calculate. So, you need to solve for Kelvin.

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">An employee needs a program to enter the before-tax price of a product and calculate its final price. Assume a value added tax (VAT) rate of 19%.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The sales tax can be easily calculated. You must multiply the before-tax price of the product by the VAT rate. Be careful—the sales tax is not the final price, but only the tax amount.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The after-tax price can be calculated by adding the initial before-tax price and the sales tax that you calculated beforehand.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this program you can use a constant named VAT for the sales tax rate (VAT rate).</p>

<h4 id="toc_7">Exercise 10.1-6 Calculating a Sales Discount</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the price of an item and the discount rate offered (on a scale of 0 to 100). The program must then calculate and display the new price.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The discount amount can be easily calculated. You must multiply the before-discount price of the product by the discount value and then divide it by 100. The division is necessary since the user enters a value for the discount on a scale of 0 to 100. Be careful—the result is not the final price but only the discount amount.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The final after-discount price can be calculated by subtracting the discount amount that you calculated beforehand from the initial before-discount price.</p>

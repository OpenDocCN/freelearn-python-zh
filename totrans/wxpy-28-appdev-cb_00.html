Currently, there are a handful of options available for cross-platform frameworks to develop desktop applications in Python. wxPython is one such cross-platform GUI toolkit for the Python programming language. It allows Python programmers to create programs with a complete, highly-functional graphical user interface, simply and easily. wxPython code style has changed quite a bit over the years, and has become much more Pythonic. The examples that you will find in this book are fully up-to-date and reflect this change in style. This cookbook provides you with the latest recipes to quickly create robust, reliable, and reusable wxPython applications. These recipes will guide you from writing simple, basic wxPython scripts all the way through complex concepts, and also feature various design approaches and techniques in wxPython.</p><p>This book starts off by covering a variety of topics, from the most basic requirements of a wxPython application, to some of the more in-depth details of the inner workings of the framework, laying the foundation for any wxPython application. It then explains event handling, basic and advanced user interface controls, interface design and layout, creating dialogs, components, extending functionality, and so on. We conclude by learning how to build and manage applications for distribution.</p><p>For each of the recipes, there is an introductory example, then more advanced examples, along with plenty of example code that shows how to develop and manage user-friendly applications. For more experienced developers, most recipes also include an additional discussion of the solution, allowing you to further customize and enhance the component.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with wxPython">Chapter 1</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Getting Started with wxPython</em></span>, introduces you to the basics of creating a wxPython application. The topics covered in this chapter will provide you with the information needed to start building your own applications, as well as some insight into the inner workings and structure of the framework.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Responding to Events">Chapter 2</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Responding to Events</em></span>, shows how to make use of events to drive an application and allow the user to interact with it through the user interface. This chapter starts with an overview of what events are and how they work, and then continues on to cover how to interact with a number of common events.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Basic Building Blocks of a User Interface">Chapter 3</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Basic Building Blocks of a User Interface</em></span>, discusses a number of the basic widgets that are critical to the creation of nearly all user interfaces. You will be introduced to the usage of widgets such as Buttons, Menus, and ToolBars in this chapter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Advanced Building Blocks of a User Interface">Chapter 4</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Advanced Building Blocks of a User Interface</em></span>, introduces you to some of the more advanced widgets available in the wxPython control library. These widgets will allow you to create tabbed interfaces and display more complex types of data in your user interface.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Providing Information and Alerting Users">Chapter 5</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Providing Information and Alerting Users</em></span>, shows multiple techniques for keeping the users of an application informed about what is going on and to provide them with help on interacting with the various controls in the applications interface. This chapter will show you how to use various tooltip controls, message boxes, and splash screens.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Retrieving Information from Users">Chapter 6</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Retrieving Information from Users</em></span>, covers the use of common dialogs to retrieve information from users in order to perform tasks such as opening files, searching text, and even printing. As a part of the recipes for the usage of<code class="literal"> FileDialog</code> and<code class="literal"> FindDialogs</code> you will create a simple Notepad-like application.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Window Layout and Design">Chapter 7</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Window Layout and Design</em></span>, is where you will be introduced to a number of concepts and techniques for designing your user interfaces in wxPython. The majority of this chapter will explain the use of Sizers to allow you to quickly implement cross-platform user interfaces.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Drawing to the Screen">Chapter 8</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Drawing to the Screen</em></span>, gives an introduction to the basics of how a user interface works, by showing you how to use some of the primitive tools to implement your own custom user interface objects. This chapter will show you how to use Device Contexts to perform custom drawing routines by creating a number of custom display controls.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Design Approaches and Techniques">Chapter 9</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Design Approaches and Techniques</em></span>, introduces you to a number of common programming patterns, and explain how to apply them to wxPython applications. The information in this chapter will provide you with an understanding of some strong approaches and techniques to software design that will not only serve you in writing wxPython applications but can also be generally applied to other frameworks as well, to expand your programming toolbox.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Creating Components and Extending Functionality">Chapter 10</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Creating Components and Extending Functionality</em></span>, shows you how to extend the functionality of existing user interface components, as well as how to create your own controls. The recipes in this chapter combine much of the information presented in Chapters 2, 7, 8, and 9 together to create new controls and to enhance the capabilities of some of the more basic ones provided by wxPython.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Using Threads and Timers to Create Responsive Interfaces">Chapter 11</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Using Threads and Timers to Create Responsive Interfaces</em></span>, dives into the world of concurrent programming. This chapter shows you how to create multi-threaded applications, and covers the special care that is needed when interacting with the user interface from worker threads in order to create stable and responsive interfaces.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Building and Managing Applications for Distribution">Chapter 12</a>,<span class="emphasis"><em> Building and Managing Applications for Distribution</em></span>, concludes the tour of the wxPython framework by introducing you to some useful recipes for bolstering the infrastructure of any application that will be distributed to end users. This includes how to store configuration information, exception handling, internationalization, and how to create and distribute stand-alone binaries of your application.</p></div></div></div>

		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>This book teaches you about the components of the FastAPI framework and how to apply these components with some third-party tools to build microservices applications. You will need a background in Python programming, knowledge of the principles of API development, and an understanding of the principles behind creating an enterprise-grade microservice application. This is more than a reference book: it provides some code blueprints that will help you solve real-world applications while elaborating on and demonstrating the topics of each chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for Python web developers, advanced Python users, and backend developers using Flask or Django who want to learn how to use the FastAPI framework to implement microservices. Readers knowledgeable about REST API and microservices will also benefit from this book. Some parts of the book contain general concepts, processes, and instructions that intermediate-level developers and Python enthusiasts can relate to as well.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>This book requires some experience with Python programming using Python 3.8 or 3.9, as well as some API development experience with any Python framework. Knowledge of the standards and best practices of coding Python, including some advanced topics such as creating decorators, generators, database connectivity, request-response transactions, HTTP status codes, and API endpoints, is required.</p>

			<p>Open an account in Okta and Auth0 for the OpenID connect security scheme. Both prefer a company email for signing up.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</strong></p>
			<p>Each chapter has a dedicated project prototype that will describe and explain the topics. If you get lost during setup, each project has a backed-up database (<code>.sql</code><em class="italic"> </em>or<em class="italic"> </em><code>.zip</code>) and a list of modules (<code>requirements.txt</code>) to fix some issues. Run the <code>\i</code><em class="italic"> </em>PostgreSQL command to install the script file or use the mongorestore from the installed Mongo Database Tools to load all the database content. Also, each project has a mini-readme that gives a general description of what the prototype wants to accomplish.</p>

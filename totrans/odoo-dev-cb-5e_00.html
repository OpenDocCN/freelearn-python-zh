			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p class="Body-Text">While you’re reading this, you’ve already been introduced to Odoo, one of the fastest-growing open-source ERP Business suites. Odoo is a full-featured open-source platform that assists in building solutions for various industries. If you’re a developer, you’re sitting on a goldmine. If you’re an end user, you’re gifted with an amazing tool to simplify your business processes, covering everything from pre-sales to sales, inventory, <span class="No-Break">and accounting.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">In addition to the extensive list of applications available in Odoo, it’s like a nice dough (mmm, does it remind you of mouthwatering pizza?) that can be molded according to your requirements. Technically, it’s a very flexible ORM-controller (Object Relational Mapping) driven application development framework built with extensibility in mind. Following the rule of inheritance, features/extensions, and modifications can be implemented as modules categorized as Apps. With ORM mentioned here, Odoo exhibits a <span class="No-Break">monolithic architecture.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">The Odoo 17 Development Cookbook provides a solid platform for developers, whether they’re beginners or proficient. The code snippets cover most questions and use cases, and the explained fields assist in developing modules accurately while maintaining code quality and usability. As a bonus, <a href="B20997_25.xhtml#_idTextAnchor1292"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Chapter 25</em></span></a> is a special one that aids developers and non-developers in generating <span class="No-Break">quick prototypes.</span></p>
			<p class="Body-Text">This book is written and supported by the entire Serpent Consulting Services Pvt Ltd team, with everyone contributing their time and effort to make the dream <span class="No-Break">a reality.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book caters to developers at all levels, requiring a minimum understanding of object-oriented programming, with Python being a mandatory skill. Even newcomers to Python programming can find this book suitable. It’s written with the intention of accommodating developers with minimal programming knowledge but a strong desire <span class="No-Break">to learn.</span></p>
			<p>The preferred development editors are PyCharm, Eclipse, or Sublime, but the majority of developers are expected to run Odoo on an Ubuntu/Debian-based operating system. The code examples are intentionally kept simple and clear, accompanied by thorough explanations to facilitate understanding. Newcomers will grasp the concepts from the basics, ensuring an enjoyable <span class="No-Break">learning journey.</span></p>
			<p>Experienced developers already familiar with Odoo should also find value in this book. It not only enhances their existing knowledge but also offers an easy way to stay updated on the latest Odoo versions, with significant <span class="No-Break">changes highlighted.</span></p>
			<p>Ultimately, this book aims to serve as a solid reference for daily use by both newcomers and experienced developers alike. Additionally, the documentation of differences between various Odoo versions will be a valuable resource for developers working with different versions simultaneously or <span class="No-Break">porting modules.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Our primary and most valuable advice is simply ‘Practice’! Each chapter provides detailed insights into the development aspect, so it’s crucial to apply what <span class="No-Break">you’ve learned.</span></p>
			<p>To fully benefit from this book, we recommend supplementing your reading with additional resources on the Python programming language, the Ubuntu/Debian Linux operating system, and the <span class="No-Break">PostgreSQL database.</span></p>
			<p>The book includes installation instructions for Odoo, so all you need is Ubuntu 20.04 or later, or any other Linux-based OS. For other operating systems, you can utilize it through a virtual machine. If you’re using Windows, you can also install Ubuntu as <span class="No-Break">a subsystem</span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			<p>This book is intended for developers who have basic knowledge of the Python programming language, as the Odoo backend runs on Python. In Odoo, data files are created with XML, so basic knowledge of XML <span class="No-Break">is required.</span></p>
			<p>This book also covers the backend JavaScript framework, PoS applications, and the website builder, which requires basic knowledge of JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap 4. The Community Edition of Odoo is open source and freely available, but a few features, including IoT, cohort, and the dashboard, are available only in the Enterprise Edition, so to follow along with that recipe, you will need the <span class="No-Break">Enterprise Edition.</span></p>

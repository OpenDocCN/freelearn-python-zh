    the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and served as communications director for
    almost two years. Doug was a columnist for the Python Magazine, before becoming
    editor-in-chief. He also created and sustained the popular Python Module of the
    Week blog, which was compiled and published in his book, *The Python 3 Standard
    Library by Example*. Doug works as a senior principal software engineer at Red
    Hat, where he focuses on community leadership and achieving long-term sustainability

- en: '**Doug Hellmann**: I got interested in computers when I was pretty young, through
    some summer programs that my local school system ran at the time. I enjoyed programming,
    and learning about how computers work, so I decided to pursue a CS degree in college.
    The work we did in school really reinforced for me that programming was something
    I could enjoy doing for a living.'

    as well as Windows NT and 95\. We had a lot of Makefiles and shell scripts, but
    they weren't especially portable. The more I used Python, the more I was able
    to find new ways to use it.

    support a magazine.

    ([https://pymotw.com](https://pymotw.com)) in 2007 as a way to push myself to
    write on a regular basis. I decided a theme would make it easier to find topics
    to write about, and writing once a week seemed like a good goal.'

    The Atlanta Python meetup group tries to maintain a good mix of introductory and
    more advanced talks to help encourage folks with a range of skills to attend our
    meetings. Sometimes the most informative part of the evening is the Q&A after
    a talk, or the discussions during breaks, when you have the chance to ask for
    more detail or clarification.

    process scale from a highly manual process for five projects, to a highly automated
    process supporting around 350 different deliverables. I've built some tools like
    `reno`, our release note management program, and I jump in on other initiatives
    where help is needed.

    your inspiration for creating `virtualenvwrapper`?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hellmann**: While I was working as a technical editor and later editor-in-chief
    for Python Magazine, I ended up needing to manage a lot of different `virtualenv`''s.
    Each author provided instructions for installing the tools they used for their
    articles, and I wanted to be able to test out the code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I started writing a few aliases to manage environments easily, and the project
    grew organically from there. My workflow has changed significantly since I've
    been so focused on OpenStack, so I haven't been contributing to `virtualenvwrapper`
    as much as I used to. I'm happy to have Jason Myers taking over as the lead maintainer
    on the project these days.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Hellmann**: Sure, I can actually think of three things that I learned while
    I was creating `virtualenvwrapper`.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all I learned how contributions come from surprising directions. Doug
    Latornell provided the original patches to support ksh. I had no idea that anyone
    would be interested in supporting ksh, so I hadn't thought beyond Bash. I think
    he was using `virtualenvwrapper` on an AIX system at that point, though, and his
    patches were easy to integrate and support once they merged.

    I created the following site just because of a Tweet from Alex Gaynor:'

- en: '"The `virtualenvwrapper.alex` installs aliases for typos related to common
    `virtualenvwrapper` commands. Really. It exists because Alex Gaynor asked nicely."'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third learning point that I have to offer is that you can't please everyone
    all of the time. So `virtualenvwrapper` supports plugins to enable folks to share
    their extensions, but there is now an entire category of similar tools like `pyenv`,
    `vex`, and others where the operating model is very different. That's great! As
    I said, my own workflow has changed enough that I don't rely on `virtualenv wrapper`
    so much anymore, either.

- en: '**Driscoll**: So if you could start `virtualenvwrapper` from scratch, what
    would you do differently?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and today I would design it as a single main command that took subcommands.'

    rewriting functional software based on backwards-incompatible upstream changes
    isn''t a high priority for most companies.'

- en: I encourage people to use the latest version of Python 3 that is available on
    their deployment platform for all new projects. I also advise them to carefully
    reconsider porting their remaining legacy applications now that most actively

    Those changes will not go into Python itself, but into tools like `setuptools`,
    `twine`, `wheel`, `pip`, and `warehouse`. Simplifying the process of packaging
    and distributing Python packages will help all of our users.'

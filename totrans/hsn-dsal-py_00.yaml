- en: Data structures play a vital role in storing and organizing data within an application.
    It is important to choose the right data structure to significantly improve the
    application’s performance, as it is highly desirable to be able to scale the application
    as the data quantity increases. This new edition teaches you essential Python
    data structures and the most common and important algorithms for building easy,
    maintainable applications. It also allows you to implement these algorithms with
    working examples and easy to follow step-by-step instructions.

- en: In this book, you will learn the essential Python data structures and the most
    common algorithms. With this easy-to-read book, you will learn how to create complex
    data structures such as linked lists, stacks, heaps, queues, trees, and graphs
    as well as sorting algorithms including bubble sort, insertion sort, heapsort,
    and quicksort. We also describe various selection algorithms such as randomized
    and deterministic selection and provide a detailed discussion of various data
    structure algorithms and design paradigms such as greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer,
    and dynamic programming. In addition, complex data structures such as trees and
    graphs are explained with easy pictorial examples to understand the concepts of
    these useful data structures. You will also learn various important string processing
    and pattern-matching algorithms such as KMP and Boyer-Moore algorithms along with
    their easy implementation in Python.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for Python developers who are studying data structures
    and algorithms at a beginner or intermediate level, as chapters provide practical
    examples and an easy approach to complex algorithms. It may also be useful for
    engineering students on a course in data structures and algorithms, as it covers
    almost all the algorithms, concepts, and designs that are studied. This book is
    also designed for software developers who want to deploy various applications
    using a specific data structures, as this book provides efficient ways to store
    relevant data.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Python Data Types and Structures*, introduces the basic data
    types and structures in Python. It will provide an overview of several built-in
    data structures available in Python that are pivotal for understanding the internals
    of data structures.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Introduction to Algorithm Design*, provides details about algorithm
    design issues and techniques. This chapter will compare different analyzing algorithms
    via running time and computation complexity, which will tell us which ones perform
    better than others for a given problem.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Algorithm Design Techniques and Strategies*, covers various important
    data structure design paradigms such as greedy algorithms, dynamic programming,
    divide-and-conquer. We will learn to create data structures via a number of primary
    principles, such as robustness, adaptability and reusability, and learn to separate
    structure from a function.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Linked Lists*, covers linked lists, which are one of the most
    common data structures and are often used to implement other structures, such
    as stacks and queues. In this chapter, we describe linked lists, their operation,
    and implementation. We compare their behavior to arrays and discuss the relative
    advantages and disadvantages of each.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Stacks and Queues*, describes stack and queue data structures
    in detail. It also discusses the behavior and demonstrates some implementations
    of these linear data structures. We give examples of typical real-life example
    applications.'

- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Trees*, considers how trees form the basis of many of the most
    important advanced data structures. In this chapter we look at how to implement
    a binary tree. We will examine how to traverse trees and retrieve and insert values.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *Graphs and Algorithms*, looks at some of the more specialized
    structures, including graphs and spatial structures. We will learn to represent
    data through nodes and vertices and create structures such as directed and undirected
    graphs. We will also learn different algorithms for minimum spanning trees such
    as Prim’s algorithm and Kruskal’s algorithm.'

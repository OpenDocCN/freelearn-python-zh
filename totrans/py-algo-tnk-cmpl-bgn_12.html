<h3 id="toc_1">6.1 How to Output Messages and Results to a User's Screen?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">A flowchart uses the oblique parallelogram and the reserved word “Write” to display a message or the final results to the user's screen.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width14" src="img/chapter06-01.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">where arg1, arg2, and arg3 can be variables, expressions, constant values, or alphanumeric values enclosed in double quotes.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The oblique parallelogram that you have just seen is equivalent to the following flowchart fragment.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width12" src="img/chapter06-02.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">In Python, you can achieve the same result by using the print statement. Its general form is</p>
<div><p>print(arg1, arg2, arg3, …  [, sep = " "] [, end = "\n"])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►arg1, arg2, arg3, … are the arguments (values)  to be printed. They can be variables, expressions, constant values, or strings enclosed in single or double quotes.</p>
<p>►sep is the string inserted between arguments. It is optional and its default value is one space character.</p>
<p>►end is the string appended after the last argument. It is optional and its default value is one “line break”.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following code fragment:</p>
<div><p>a = 5</p>
<p>b = 6</p>
<p>c = a + b</p>
<p>print("The sum of 5 and 6 is", c)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">display the message shown in Figure 6–1. </p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width19" src="img/chapter06-03.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–1 A string and an integer displayed on the screen</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>In Python, if you want to display a string on the screen, the string must be enclosed in single or double quotes.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note the space inserted automatically on the screen between the first string and the value of variable c (just after the word “is”).</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The result of a mathematical expression can also be calculated directly in a print statement. The following code fragment displays exactly the same message as in Figure 6–1.</p>
<div><p>a = 5</p>
<p>b = 6</p>
<p>print("The sum of 5 and 6 is", a + b)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_2">6.2 How to Alter the Default Behavior of a print Statement?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">As already stated, Python automatically outputs a space between arguments. The following example</p>
<div><p>print("Morning", "Evening", "Night")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">displays</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width16" src="img/chapter06-04.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–2 The output result displays a space between arguments</p>
<p class="my_basic">Also keep in mind that the following three statements produce the same output result no matter how many space characters exist after the comma ( , ) delimiter:</p>
<div><p>print("Morning","Evening","Night")</p>
<p>print("Morning", "Evening", "Night")</p>
<p>print("Morning",   "Evening",   "Night")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">as shown in Figure 6–3.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width18" src="img/chapter06-05.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–3 The output result always displays one space between arguments</p>
<p class="my_basic">If you wish to customize the separator character, you need to use a value for argument sep as shown here:</p>
<div><p>print("Morning", "Evening", "Night", sep = "#")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">and the output result now becomes as shown in Figure 6–4.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width18" src="img/chapter06-06.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–4 The output result with a customized separator</p>
<p class="my_basic">Now, look carefully at the following example.</p>
<div><p>a = "Ares"</p>
<p>print("Hello", a)</p>
<p>print("Halo", a)</p>
<p>print("Salut", a)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The print statement in Python automatically appends a “line break” after the last argument (variable a); thus, these three messages are displayed one under the other as shown in Figure 6–5.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width17" src="img/chapter06-07.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–5 The output result displays on three lines</p>
<p class="my_basic">You can customize the value of the end argument as shown here:</p>
<div><p>a = "Ares"</p>
<p>print("Hello", a, end = " - ")</p>
<p>print("Halo", a, end = " - ")</p>
<p>print("Salut", a)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The output result now becomes as shown in Figure 6–6.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width25" src="img/chapter06-08.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–6 The output result displays on one line</p>
<p class="my_basic">An interesting sequence of characters is the \n which can be used to create a custom “line break”. You can output a “line break” as shown here:</p>
<div><p>a = "Ares"</p>
<p>print("Hello", a, "\nHalo", a, "\nSalut", a)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">and the output result is shown in Figure 6–7.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width20" src="img/chapter06-09.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–7 The output result displays on three lines</p>
<p class="my_basic">Another useful sequence of characters is the \t which can be used to create a “tab stop”. The tab character ( \t ) is useful for aligning output.</p>
<div><p>print("John\tGeorge")</p>
<p>print("Sofia\tMary")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The output result appears in Figure 6–8. </p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width16" src="img/chapter06-10.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–8 The output result displays tab characters</p>
<p class="my_basic">Of course, the same result can be accomplished with one single statement.</p>
<div><p>print("John\tGeorge\nSofia\tMary")</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_3">6.3 How to Prompt the User to Enter Data?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Do you recall the three main stages involved in creating an algorithm or a computer program? The first stage was the “data input” stage, in which the computer lets the user enter data such as numbers, their name, their address, or their year of birth.</p>
<p class="my_basic">A flowchart uses the oblique parallelogram and the reserved word “Read” to let a user enter their data.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width22" src="img/chapter06-11.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">where var_name1, var_name2, and var_name3 must be variables only.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The oblique parallelogram that you have just seen is equivalent to the following flowchart fragment.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width11" src="img/chapter06-12.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>When a Read statement is executed, the flow of execution is interrupted until the user has entered all the data. When data entry is complete, the flow of execution continues to the next statement. Usually data are entered from a keyboard.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In Python, data input is accomplished using one of the following statements:</p>
<div><p>#Read a string from the keyboard</p>
<p>var_name_str = input([prompt])</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Read an integer from the keyboard</p>
<p>var_name_int = int(input([prompt]))</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Read a real from the keyboard</p>
<p>var_name_float = float(input([prompt]))</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►prompt is the prompt message to be displayed. It can be either a variable or a string enclosed in single or double quotes. The argument prompt is optional.</p>
<p>►var_name_str can be any variable of type string.</p>
<p>►var_name_int can be any variable of type integer.</p>
<p>►var_name_float can be any variable of type float (real).</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Functions int() and float() are discussed later in this book.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Let's study the input() statement using the following example.</p>
<div><p>name = input("What is your name? ")</p>
<p>print("Hello", name)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">When the input() statement of this example executes, the message “What is your name?” (without the double quotes) is displayed and the flow of execution stops, waiting for the user to enter their name. The print() statement is not yet executed! As long as the user doesn't enter anything, the computer just waits, as shown in Figure 6–9.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width18" src="img/chapter06-13.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–9 When an input() statement executes, the computer waits for data input.</p>
<p class="my_basic">When the user finally enters their name and hits the “Enter  <img alt="Image" class="inline_image" src="img/key_enter.png"/>” key, the flow of execution then continues to the next print() statement as shown in Figure 6–10.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width18" src="img/chapter06-14.png"/></p>
<p class="caption">Figure 6–10 The flow of execution continues when the user hits the “Enter  <img alt="Image" class="inline_image" src="img/key_enter.png"/>” key.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following code fragment prompts the user to enter a string and a float, that is, a number that contains a fractional part.</p>
<div><p>productName = input("Enter product name: ")</p>
<p>productPrice = float(input("Enter product price: "))</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The following program prompts the user to enter a string and an integer, that is, a number without a fractional part and then displays a message.</p>
<div><p>name = input("What is your name? ")</p>
<p>age = int(input("What is your age? "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>print("Wow, you are already", age, "years old,", name, "!")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In Python (even though it is not frequently used), you can read two or more values using just one line of code, as shown here.</p>
<div><p>name, age = input("What is your name? "), int(input("What is your age? "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>print("Wow, you are already", age, "years old,", name, "!")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The corresponding flowchart fragment, however, must look like this</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width28" src="img/chapter06-15.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">In Python, it is recommended to display the prompt messages using the input() statement. The following example is correct, but it is not frequently used.</p>
<div><p>print("What is your name? ", end = "")</p>
<p>name = input()</p>
<div></div>
<p>print("What is your age? ", end = "")</p>
<p>age = int(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>print("Wow, you are already", age, "years old,", name, "!")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In this book there is a slight difference between the words “prompts” and “lets”. When an exercise says “Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter…” this means that you must include a prompt message. However, when the exercise says “Write a Python program that lets the user enter…” this means that you are not actually required to include a prompt message; that is, it is not wrong to include one but you don't have to!  The following example lets the user enter their name and age (but does not prompt them to).</p>
<div><p>name = input()</p>
<p>age = int(input())</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">What happens here (when the program is executed) is that the computer displays a text cursor without any prompt message and waits for the user to enter two values—one for name and one for age. The user, though, must be a prophet and guess what to enter! Do they have to enter their name first and then their age, or is it the opposite? So, obviously a prompt message is pretty much required, because it makes your program more user-friendly.</p>

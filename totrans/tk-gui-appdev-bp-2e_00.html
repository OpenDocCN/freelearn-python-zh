<p class="mce-root"><em>Tkinter GUI Application Development Blueprints</em>, <em>Second Edition</em> will walk you through the process of developing real-world graphical applications using Python and Tkinter, the built-in GUI module of Python.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book attempts to highlight the features and capabilities of Tkinter while demonstrating best practices involved in writing GUI programs, irrespective of the library that you choose to build your application with. Here, you will learn how to use Tkinter to develop exciting, fun, and useful GUI applications with Tkinter and Python.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We hope to take you on a fun journey through more than 10 projects from different problem domains. As we develop new applications in each project, the book also builds up a catalog of some commonly used strategies to develop real-world applications.</p>

<p>Software developers, scientists, researchers, engineers, students, and programming hobbyists with basic familiarity with Python will find this book interesting and informative. A motivated Python newbie with a background in writing programs can fill in the gaps of knowledge with a little outside research.</p>
<p>People familiar with basic programming constructs in other programming languages can also catch up with some brief reading on Python. No GUI programming experience is assumed.</p>

<p><span><a href="39a58f50-293e-4ff5-9b65-0d9e0c0cc15e.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Meet Tkinter</em>, begins from scratch, providing an overview of Tkinter and covering details of how to create root windows, add widgets to a root window, handle layout with geometry managers, and work with events.</span></p>
<p><a href="41f1fda5-b3b1-4dfa-8971-2a016274d39a.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Making a Text Editor</em>, develops a text editor using the procedural style of programming. It gives readers their first taste of several features of Tkinter and what it is like to develop a real application.</p>
<p><span><a href="e107248f-043c-4c95-b5e1-21b9ab99517a.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Programmable Drum Machine</em>, uses object-oriented programming to develop a drum machine that is capable of playing user-composed rhythms. The application can also save compositions and later edit or replay them. Here, you will learn the techniques of designing a GUI application using a model-first philosophy and writing multithreaded GUI applications.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="7e561bee-a102-437c-bfdf-018694145027.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Game of Chess</em>, introduces the key aspects of structuring a GUI application using the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. It also teaches the art of taking a real-world object (chess) and modeling it in the notations that your program can manipulate. In addition, it introduces readers to the power of the Tkinter Canvas widget.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="73aef6b5-11e2-4cb9-bb4a-5c96bf81dfcc.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Building an Audio Player</em>, covers the concepts of working with external libraries while showing you how to work with many different Tkinter widgets. Most importantly, it shows how to make your own Tkinter widgets, thereby extending the capabilities of the Tkinter manifold.</span></p>
<p><a href="ea2fc662-7799-456e-b596-abb38f5fadcb.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Paint Application</em>, looks at the Tkinter Canvas widget in detail. As you will see, the Canvas widget is truly a highlight of Tkinter. The chapter also introduces the concept of the GUI framework, thereby creating reusable code for all your future programs.</p>
<p><a href="d70da161-121d-453a-806b-95b71524fb79.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Piano Tutor</em>, demonstrates how to represent the given domain information using JSON and then apply the data thus created to create an interactive application. It also discusses the concept of program responsiveness and how to handle it with Tkinter.</p>
<p><a href="7f88607b-582a-4f9e-a922-7cd9333d320e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Fun with Canvas</em><span>, is dedicated to harnessing the powerful visualization capabilities of Tkinter's canvas widget. It looks at examples from several important mathematical domains to build different kinds of useful and beautiful simulations.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="f84beec3-a790-4e48-93d7-44721d29f02d.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Multiple Fun Projects</em>, works through a series of small but functional projects, demonstrating problems from different domains such as animation, network programming, socket programming, database programming, asynchronous programming, and multithreaded programming.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="cabe3587-e359-4987-9dde-52d04270aba3.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Miscellaneous Tips</em>, discusses some vital aspects of GUI programming that, though not covered in the previous chapters, form a common theme in many GUI programs.</span></p>

<p>We assume an introductory level familiarity with the basic constructs of Python programming language. <span>We use Python version 3.6 with Tkinter 8.6, and it is recommended to stick to these exact versions to avoid compatibility issues.</span></p>
<p>The programs discussed in this book have been developed on the Linux Mint platform. However, given the multiplatform abilities of Tkinter, you can easily work on other platforms such as Windows, Mac OS, and other distributions of Linux. The links to download and install other project-specific modules and software are mentioned in the respective chapters.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> </p>
<p>"The <kbd>reset_to_initial_locations()</kbd> method initializes all the locations to reflect the starting position of the game."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>def toggle_play_button_state(self):<br/>  if self.now_playing:<br/>    self.play_button.config(state="disabled")<br/>  else:<br/>    self.play_button.config(state="normal")</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>def on_loop_button_toggled(self):<br/>  self.loop = self.to_loop.get()<br/>  self.keep_playing = self.loop<br/>  <strong>if self.now_playing:</strong><br/><strong>    self.now_playing = self.loop</strong><br/>  self.toggle_play_button_state()</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyglet</strong><br/><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(pyglet.media)</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "<span class="fontstyle0">In our example, we will add menu items to the</span> <span class="fontstyle2"><span class="packt_screen">File</span></span><span class="fontstyle0">,</span> <span class="fontstyle2"><span class="packt_screen">Edit</span></span><span class="fontstyle0">, and</span> <span class="fontstyle2"><span class="packt_screen">About</span></span> <span class="fontstyle0">menu.</span></span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>

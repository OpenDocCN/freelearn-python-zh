<div><h1 class="mainHeading" id="_idParaDest-7">Preface</h1>
<p class="normal">Django is an open-source Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development and presents a relatively shallow learning curve for beginner programmers. Django follows Python’s “batteries included” philosophy, shipping with a rich and versatile set of modules that solve common web-development problems. The simplicity of Django, together with its powerful features, makes it attractive to both novice and expert programmers. Django has been designed for simplicity, flexibility, reliability, and scalability.</p>
<p class="normal">Nowadays, Django is used by countless start-ups and large organizations such as Instagram, Spotify, Pinterest, Udemy, Robinhood, and Coursera. It is not by coincidence that, over the last few years, Django has consistently been chosen by developers worldwide as one of the most loved web frameworks in Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey.</p>
<p class="normal">This book will guide you through the entire process of developing professional web applications with Django. The book focuses on explaining how the Django web framework works by building multiple projects from the ground up. This book not only covers the most relevant aspects of the framework but also explains how to apply Django to very diverse real-world situations.</p>
<p class="normal">This book not only teaches Django but also presents other popular technologies, such as PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, and Memcached. You will learn how to integrate these technologies into your Django projects throughout the book to create advanced functionalities and build complex web applications.</p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Django 5 By Example</em> will walk you through the creation of real-world applications, solving commonproblems, and implementing best practices, using a step-by-step approach that is easy to follow.</p>
<p class="normal">After reading this book, you will have a good understanding of how Django works and how to build full-fledged Python web applications.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-8">Who this book is for</h1>
<p class="normal">This book should serve as a primer for programmers newly initiated to Django. The book is intended for developers with Python knowledge who wish to learn Django in a pragmatic manner. Perhaps you are completely new to Django, or you already know a little but you want to get the most out of it. This book will help you to master the most relevant areas of the framework by building practical projects from scratch. You need to have familiarity with programming concepts in order to read this book. In addition to basic Python knowledge, some previous knowledge of HTML and JavaScript is assumed.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-9">What this book covers</h1>

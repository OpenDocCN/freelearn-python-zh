<strong>Mike Driscoll</strong>: Could you give a little <a id="id450" class="indexterm"/>background about yourself, Luciano?</p><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho</strong>: Sure, I'm a self-taught programmer. I was born in Brazil in 1963. When I was 15 years old, in 1978, I saw the Lunar Lander game<a id="id451" class="indexterm"/> running on a HP-25 calculator and became excited about the possibilities of combining programmable calculators and board games, which were my main geek passion at the time.</p><p>Later that year, my father's <a id="id452" class="indexterm"/>employer gave him a TI-58 calculator, which I promptly borrowed and never returned. My first interesting program was a port of the Lunar Lander from the HP to the TI language (both were assembly-like languages).</p><p>In 1981 I spent a year as an exchange student in Harrisburg, IL, and I was one of two volunteers that taught ourselves to program on the Apple II computers that the high school library had just received; no one else in the school knew what to do with them.</p><p>After I came back to Brazil, my first job was translating Apple II software manuals to Portuguese, and my second job was teaching programming, which became a lifelong passion for me.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'My second job was teaching programming, which became a lifelong passion for me.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Since then, I've spent about half of my time being a programmer and half of my time being a teacher. I worked as a programmer for 8-bit educational software, CP/M standalone business apps, Windows client-server apps, Windows and macOS CD-ROMs, and on backend systems running on Unix for some of the earliest web portals in Brazil.</p><p>I had a couple of small companies (a desktop publishing bureau, a software house and a training company) and now I am proud to be a principal consultant at ThoughtWorks.</p><p>Today, the kind of programming that I like to do the most, is example code to illustrate new concepts in languages, APIs, and platforms. I'm very interested in DX (developer experience) as well. I really enjoy the challenge of coding the simplest example that can demonstrate an idea and still be interesting (not just <code class="literal">foo</code> and <code class="literal">bar</code> abstractions). That's why I call myself <em>a stand-up programmer</em>.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: Why did you become a programmer?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: I became a programmer because I enjoy programming as much as I enjoy playing board games.</p><p>I see a very strong parallel: the keywords and functions provided by a language are like the playing pieces and other game resources at your disposal, which you must arrange to achieve the desired effect. The language semantics are like the game rules. If a language has syntactic macros, then that's like being able to create completely new pieces during a game - a very powerful ability.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'I became a programmer because I enjoy programming as much as I enjoy playing board games.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Besides being fun, programming<a id="id453" class="indexterm"/> lets us have a <a id="id454" class="indexterm"/>huge impact in the world, and I try to always have a positive impact.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>:  Why Python?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: I learned more than a<a id="id455" class="indexterm"/> dozen languages before Python, and I've studied at least half a dozen after it. But Python is the one that I've used for the longest time throughout my career.</p><p>Python fits <a id="id456" class="indexterm"/>my brain, as the saying goes. I find it elegant yet practical, simple but not simplistic, consistent but not rigid or limiting. After a while, I also made many friends in the Python community, so that became a huge reason to stick with it, even when sometimes I longed for something different.</p><p>I stumbled upon Python in 1998 when I was learning the OO features of Perl 5, which I'd been using for web development. At the time, whenever someone in the Perl mailing lists asked about the OO-way of doing something, comparisons to Python came up. After two or three such mentions of Python, I decided to look it up.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'I read Guido van Rossum's tutorial and fell in love with the language. It combined the best qualities of Perl and Java.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I read Guido van Rossum's tutorial and fell in love with the language. It combined the best qualities of Perl and Java, the two languages that I was using most at the time. Python was a <em>real</em> OO language with a decent class library, <a id="id457" class="indexterm"/>like Java, but it was also concise and practical, like Perl, and more<a id="id458" class="indexterm"/> readable, consistent, and pleasant to use than both. I think that Python is a masterpiece of language design.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: What do you think makes Python such a good language for AI and machine learning?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: The most important and <a id="id459" class="indexterm"/>immediate reason is that the NumPy and SciPy libraries enable projects such as scikit-learn, which is currently almost a de facto standard tool for machine learning.</p><p>The reason why NumPy, SciPy, <a id="id460" class="indexterm"/>scikit-learn, and so many other libraries were created in the first place is because Python has some features that make it very attractive for scientific computing. Python has a simple and consistent syntax which makes programming more accessible to people who are not software engineers.</p><p>Another reason is operator overloading, which<a id="id461" class="indexterm"/> enables code that is readable and concise. Then there's Python's <a id="id462" class="indexterm"/>buffer protocol (PEP 3118), which is a standard for external libraries to interoperate efficiently with Python when processing array-like data structures. Finally, Python benefits from a rich ecosystem of libraries for scientific computing, which attracts more scientists and creates a virtuous cycle.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: What could make Python a better language for AI and machine learning?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: The biggest <a id="id463" class="indexterm"/>challenge for AI and <a id="id464" class="indexterm"/>machine learning projects in Python is deploying to production with all of the external dependencies required by such projects. Containers help a lot, but it's never easy.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: How did you become an author, Luciano?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: <em>Fluent Python</em> was the <a id="id465" class="indexterm"/>fourth book that I started, but the first that I finished. Writing a book takes a lot of time and it's easy to underestimate the required effort.</p><p>In 2013, I submitted a talk proposal <a id="id466" class="indexterm"/>for OSCON and was accepted. While I was at the conference, I approached the O'Reilly booth with four slides of a presentation on my iPad: book title, about me, and two slides of outline. They were interested and sent me the template for a book proposal. A couple of months later, I had signed a contract and got a small advance.</p><p>I worked on the book part-time initially. During that <a id="id467" class="indexterm"/>time, Meghan Blanchette, the editor, was the only person reading it. She gave me some very valuable guidance, especially with the flow of the book.</p><p>About nine months into the project, the first deadline was approaching and I would not make it. The O'Reilly contract included a clause that allowed a co-author to be imposed if I had a problem delivering. But <em>Fluent Python</em> was a very personal project for me, so I decided to quit all of my other freelance engagements and just focus on the book.</p><p>I worked for another <a id="id468" class="indexterm"/>nine months, probably around 50 hours a week, and finished it. During that second half, the tech editors joined the project. The <a id="id469" class="indexterm"/>reviewers were<a id="id470" class="indexterm"/> all people that I admire: Alex Martelli, Anna Ravenscroft, Lennart Regebro, and<a id="id471" class="indexterm"/> Leonardo Rochael. Victor Stinner<a id="id472" class="indexterm"/> focused on the chapter about asyncio, which was<a id="id473" class="indexterm"/> a new topic for the rest of us. They all gave me a lot of excellent feedback and<a id="id474" class="indexterm"/> encouragement.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: What did you learn from writing <em>Fluent Python</em>?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: I learned a lot about Python. While writing, I explored parts of the standard library that I had never visited before.</p><p>I grokked uniquely Pythonic language features like attribute descriptors and <code class="literal">yield from</code> expressions. I finally discovered why a Python program on Windows has no problem printing to cmd.exe console, but crashes with <code class="literal">UnicodeEncodeError</code> when its output is redirected to a file.</p><p>I learned a lot more about Python. I also learned the value of being yourself. Being passionate about a subject and knowing it well are good foundations for creating content.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'I also learned the value of being yourself. Being passionate about a subject and knowing it well are good foundations for creating content.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I'm an avid reader, which is essential for writing. I am also very opinionated about language design. As a reader, I had been annoyed by technical authors who mixed facts and opinions in their writing, so I came up with the idea of the Soapbox sections at the end of each chapter. I could offer my opinions, while also making it clear to readers that they could skip that part. The Soapboxes were fun to write, and several reviewers enjoyed them as well. So that's an example of how being myself worked very well.</p><p>The Python community<a id="id475" class="indexterm"/> is made up of people who love to share what they know, and they deserve credit. So I kept notes of all the important references that I used during the book, including not only other books, but also blog posts, videos, and even StackOverflow answers. I shared these notes with readers in the <em>Further Reading</em> sections. That is also a feature of the book that some reviewers have praised.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

<strong>who love to share what they know, and they deserve credit. So I kept notes of all the important references.'</strong>
</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>On a personal level, writing <em>Fluent Python</em> and witnessing its success in reviews and sales was great for my self-esteem, after I had failed at writing a book on three prior attempts. So I guess one lesson is that it pays to persevere and go all-in when you believe in a project.</p><p>Some readers have offered me a<a id="id476" class="indexterm"/> lot of great feedback, and the most prolific of them became a good<a id="id477" class="indexterm"/> friend: Elias Dorneles. So <a id="id478" class="indexterm"/>another lesson is the importance of being open to feedback, and offering people the opportunity to give it.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: What would you do differently if you could start over?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: I'd write a shorter book! My original plan was to write 300 pages, but in the end it came to 770.</p><p>Alternatively, I could have written five shorter books, because each part of <em>Fluent Python</em> from II to VI works pretty well independently. But the resulting volume set would have been more expensive for readers, and perhaps would not have resulted in the same level of recognition and sales.</p><p>I have no regrets, because I've come to believe that whatever happens is the only thing that could have. I learned this from author Bruce Eckel, as <a id="id479" class="indexterm"/>one of the rules for open space events.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'Whatever happens is the only thing that could have. I learned this from author Bruce Eckel, as one of the rules for open space events.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: How did you end up <a id="id480" class="indexterm"/>co-founding the<a id="id481" class="indexterm"/> Brazilian Python Association?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: The Brazilian Python community<a id="id482" class="indexterm"/> grew organically around a couple of mailing lists and a<a id="id483" class="indexterm"/> wiki created by Osvaldo Santana. I was already using Python as my main language, and I had written a tutorial for a magazine, but it was Osvaldo's wiki that encouraged me to engage with the wider community.</p><p>Many of us would get together every year at FISL, which was the largest FOSS conference in Brazil. It's incredible how meeting face-to-face, and going out for beers, can strengthen a community that started online.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'It's incredible how meeting face-to-face, and going out for beers, can strengthen a community that started online.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Rodrigo Senra <a id="id484" class="indexterm"/>organized the first<a id="id485" class="indexterm"/> Brazilian Python conference, and Jean Ferri the second. Running those conferences without a formal support entity was difficult: the organizers couldn't sign contracts, issue invoices, or collect sponsorships in the name of a vague community. So at one FISL, we decided to create the Brazilian Python Foundation.</p><p>We faced months of bureaucracy when we learned that foundation is a reserved word under Brazilian law. In order to be a foundation, we needed a five-year plan of action. We needed some staff and an endowment large enough to fund our staff and all of our plans for at least five years. So we had to change our plans and become the more humble Brazilian Python Association (APyB)!</p><p>In the end, we succeeded due to our perseverance and the resourcefulness of Dorneles Tremea, our first managing director and my successor as president of the APyB.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: I've heard some people challenge the <a id="id486" class="indexterm"/>value of APyB. What's your response to such criticism?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: Yes, I know that some people have questioned the usefulness of APyB, which does demand some time from its volunteer president and directors after all. My main argument in the defense of APyB is that we tried doing without it and it was worse.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: So what <a id="id487" class="indexterm"/>open source projects are you working on right now?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: Actually, none at this time! I did start the <code class="literal">pingo</code> project, which is a device-independent API for programming devices with GPIO interfaces. But I only managed to attract Lucas Vido<a id="id488" class="indexterm"/> as a solid contributor. Both of us got busy with other things, so the project is abandoned right now. I'd like to reboot it, but I don't know when I'll be able to do that.</p><p>All of the code and <a id="id489" class="indexterm"/>slides from my conference talks and tutorials is open content. I have over 50 presentations shared for<a id="id490" class="indexterm"/> anyone who wants to see them: <a class="ulink" href="https://speakerdeck.com/ramalho">https://speakerdeck.com/ramalho</a>. All of these talks are also on GitHub in the <code class="literal">/fluentpython organization</code> and in my personal GitHub account (<code class="literal">/ramalho</code>.)</p><p>I've started writing open content for learning Go. It's more likely that my next open source project will be a book or some other content, rather than applications or libraries.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: Oh, that's great that you're thinking about writing another book! So do you have any advice<a id="id491" class="indexterm"/> for aspiring authors?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: Well, I'm no economist, but I think that writing books is just as likely to pay your bills as playing the guitar, so don't do it for the money, but for the love of your subject.</p><p>Also, be ready for a very long journey. Have savings, so you can take some time off just to write if needed. Two very successful authors that I know have told me that most of the experiences that they have had with co-authors were bad. So I guess there's no easy way out of the long and mostly lonely journey of being an author!</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: Have you considered self-publishing at all?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: Yes, I have, but while there<a id="id492" class="indexterm"/> are several self-publishing alternatives, I think that it's worthwhile to do at least your first book with a good publisher if you can. The first reason is all of the support that you get from a good editor and your technical reviewers. The second reason is the recognition that you get from having a well-known brand promoting your work and adorning its cover.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: When you're writing a book, do you create the code before you start writing or not?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: I believe that code examples are the heart of any programming book: you can't have an excellent book without excellent examples. David Geary, the <a id="id493" class="indexterm"/>author of the classic <em>Graphic Java</em> books, once wrote that writing a programming book is essentially coming up with enlightening examples, then surrounding them with explanations. I took his advice and it worked very well for me.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'I believe that code examples are the heart of any programming book: you can't have an excellent book without excellent examples.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>So while the hardest part for me is certainly coming up with the examples, I had created a lot of the code before I started writing. I definitely didn't start with an empty text file and a blank screen!</p><p>Many of the examples and explanations that are in <em>Fluent Python</em> are ones that I'd developed over more than 10 years of teaching and speaking about Python. I did also create many more specifically for the book, and in fact many examples that I never used in the book, because they either became too complicated, or I had then thought of better examples.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'Here is a great learning point for all Python teachers: we must learn to let go of our examples and writing.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Here is a great learning point for all Python teachers: we must learn to let go of our examples and writing, when necessary, no matter how much work we've put into them. So when, as teachers and authors, we find a better approach, or we realize that we've just gone too far, then it's important that we let go of our examples and move on for our readers.</p><p>I know already that I will<a id="id494" class="indexterm"/> try to drop even more material like this when I work on my next book. I also think about this as a teacher. The writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry said in the context of airplane design: "It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove."</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: What are you most excited about in Python today?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: Besides the runaway success of Python in data science, I am also excited about the potential of the <code class="literal">async/await</code> keywords to enable asynchronous programming, not only through the standard <code class="literal">asyncio</code> library, but also through third-party libraries such as Trio.</p><p>Regarding Python 3.7, the <a id="id495" class="indexterm"/>addition that most excites me is PEP 557<a id="id496" class="indexterm"/>, which introduces a standard way of creating classes with explicit data attributes. This is something that libraries such as ORMs had to reinvent repeatedly.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: What do you think about <a id="id497" class="indexterm"/>Python 2.7? Should people move to the latest version?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: Yes, people should totally move<a id="id498" class="indexterm"/> over to Python 3.6. The language is evolving nicely and most libraries have been ported for years now. However, not everyone can afford to make the move.</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<strong>Luciano Ramalho: 'Yes, people should totally move over to Python 3.6. The language is evolving nicely and most libraries have been ported for years now.'</strong>
</p></blockquote></div><p>The trickiest part is sorting out the issue with <code class="literal">strings</code> versus <code class="literal">bytes</code>. This is a very positive change, but one that can't be automated, because in Python 2.7 <code class="literal">strings</code> are sometimes handled as human text and sometimes as <code class="literal">raw bytes</code>.</p><p>
<strong>Driscoll</strong>: What changes would you like to see in future Python releases?</p><p>
<strong>Ramalho</strong>: I'd like to see the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)<a id="id499" class="indexterm"/> gone, so that we could leverage all processor cores when using <code class="literal">threads</code> for CPU intensive work. Unfortunately, the latest effort to do so, by Larry Hastings, seems to have stalled in mid-2017.</p><p>The main problem is that <a id="id500" class="indexterm"/>removing the GIL would break most (or all, depending on who you ask) external libraries that rely on the Python/C API. One fact that most people don't realize is that without the GIL, writing an extension for Python in another language would be much more complicated. So, although we wish that the GIL did not exist, in reality it is a cornerstone of the success of Python.</p><p>Eric Snow, a <a id="id501" class="indexterm"/>Python core developer, wrote that the GIL is more of a PR issue. Yes, it is possible to write highly concurrent I/O-bound code using Python <code class="literal">threads</code> or asynchronous libraries. But when such a project grows, or is heavily stressed, CPU-intensive bottlenecks emerge. Those bottlenecks are extremely hard to find in threaded code, but they slow down everything because of the GIL.</p><p>Maybe only a fraction of Python<a id="id502" class="indexterm"/> projects is seriously affected by the GIL today, but CPUs are getting more cores and not getting faster, so leveraging multiple cores is becoming more and more important (<a class="ulink" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2015-June/034177.html">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2015-June/034177.html</a> or <a class="ulink" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/650521/">https://lwn.net/Articles/650521/)</a>.</p><p>

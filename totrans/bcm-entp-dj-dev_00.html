			<p>Django, a backend framework with frontend tools built in, is designed to help developers build apps quickly and easily. It is designed to take much of the hassle out of web development so that developers can focus more on the features they are building and not the problems they are facing. Loaded with dozens of tools and combined with countless third-party Python packages, Django provides many features and components that work right out of the box. </p>
			<p>The Django framework has been built with scalability and versatility in mind. As demand and traffic grow, so can your project. This allows developers to build onto an existing system easily. Security is also something that Django takes seriously by building many different security measures directly into its framework. This has been done to help developers avoid common mistakes when it comes to security. It even has its own user authentication system to help manage your users.</p>
			<p>In this book, we will learn about the fundamental components of the Django framework and how it relates to web development. From small websites to large, enterprise-level applications, this book will dive in and discuss the essential components for building a website or app of any size.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book focuses on full-stack enterprise-level application development. If you are looking to build a web app, API, or website or maintain an existing project, this book is for you. The book assumes intermediate-level knowledge of the Python programming language and it has been carefully fine-tuned for those who are new to the Django framework. Whether you are new to web development or have years of experience working with other technologies, this book is for you.</p>

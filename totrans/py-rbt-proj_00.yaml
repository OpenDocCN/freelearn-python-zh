- en: In this book, you will learn the basics of robotics using Raspberry Pi as our
    hardware and Python as our programming language. The projects we undertake will
    help readers to understand the basics of the language and the hardware we are
    using. The technologies we are exploring in this book are the ones that act as
    a baseline for most of the robots we use. By going through this book, readers
    will not only understand how to make the projects mentioned in this book but also
    move a step ahead and give shape to their imagination. In this book, we will be
    using very cheap hardware and software that are open source, making it easy to
    afford. In this, we will start with Python, so even a 12-year-old will be able
    to understand and implement it. Besides this, we will be exploring different hardware
    and their working principle so that you just don't interface the hardware but
    get to know it to the most minute detail. For those who have a will to explore
    robotics using the latest technology and language, this could be the perfect place
    to start.

    make you understand the basics of our hardware and Python. Using simple LEDs,
    we will start to make simple programs in Python.'

    will discuss how to connect various sensors, starting with interfacing a switch
    through an ultrasonic range finder and finally to a light sensor (LDR) using an
    analog-to-digital converter.'

    Robot*, will use various sensors, such as a soil humidity sensor, and a temperature
    sensor to sense the climate, and using a solenoid valve controlled by a relay,
    we will be making a robot that waters the garden whenever required.'

    will discuss the working of motor and how it can be driven by a motor driver,
    how a full H bridge motor driver works, and also how the speed control mechanism
    works in the motor driver. While doing all this, we will control a motor and make
    it move in a different direction at different speeds.'

    Robot*, will teach you how to make a robot that will feed your pet whenever you
    have programmed it using motors and other sensors. It would also sense if the
    pet is there or not, and until such time as the pet eats its food, the buzzer
    will always be left on to make sure that the pet understands that the food is
    dispensed. Also, using force sensors, we will be able to make out how much food
    has been eaten. After a sufficient quantity of food has been consumed, the buzzer
    will be deactivated.'

    and the concepts of a skid-steer mechanism will be implemented. You will also
    learn how to use the Bluetooth onboard our Raspberry Pi and connect it to your
    mobile phone. Finally, using an app, we will control our robotic vehicle using
    our mobile phone.'

    to determine distances. Also, we will make smart algorithms to sense distance
    on all sides and then move in the direction where the distance is greatest.'

    Using servo motor, we will make an area scanner, in other words, a homemade LIDAR.
    Using this home-built sensor, we would make a self-navigating car.'

    to recognize faces using insights from the previous chapter. It would then be
    trained to recognize a specific face and react differently when it recognizes
    the face familiar to it. Finally, we will make a guard robot that will guard your
    house; when it recognizes your face, it will let you in. If it recognizes an unknown
    face, then it will raise an alarm.'

Announced during Google's Campfire One event, App Engine was described as something easy to use, easy to scale and free to get started; three design goals that perfectly matched the requirements of a typical tech start-up trying to reduce the time to market.</p><p>While other big companies at that time were already offering to lease part of their own infrastructure, selling reliability and scalability in an affordable, pay-per-use fashion, Google set App Engine one step ahead by providing developers with application-building blocks instead of simple access to hardware; it is a hosting model followed by many others later on. The goal of this model is to let developers focus on the code and forget about failing machines, network issues, scalability problems, and performance tuning; the choice of Python as the first programming language supported by App Engine was a natural choice for a tool whose aim is to make writing and running web applications easier.</p><p>During the Google I/O event in 2012, Google announced that several other building blocks from its own infrastructure would be made available under the name of Google Cloud Platform, first as a partner program and then as a general availability product. Currently, App Engine is not only a notable member of the Cloud Platform family but also a mature and well-maintained platform, widely adopted and with a huge list of customers' success stories.</p><p>This book will teach you how to write and run web applications in Python with App Engine, getting the most out of Google Cloud Platform. Starting with a simple application, you will add more and more features to it, each time with the help of the components and services provided by Google's infrastructure.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started</em></span>, will help you get your hands dirty with a very simple functional Python application running on a production server. The chapter begins with making a survey of Google's cloud infrastructure, showing where App Engine is placed and how it compares to other well-known cloud services. It then walks readers through downloading and installing the runtime for Linux, Windows, and OS X, coding a <code class="literal">Hello, World!</code> application and deploying it on App Engine. The last part introduces administration consoles both for the development and production servers.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. A More Complex Application">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A More Complex Application</em></span>, teaches you how to implement a complex web application running on App Engine. It begins with an introduction to the bundled webapp2 framework and possible alternatives; then, you will get in touch with user authentication and form handling and then an introduction to Google's Datastore nonrelational database. The last part shows you how to make HTML pages through templates rendering and how to serve all the static files needed to style the page.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Storing and Processing Users' Data">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Storing and Processing Users' Data</em></span>, will show you how to add more functionalities to the app from the previous chapter. The chapter begins by showing you how to let users upload files using Google Cloud Storage and how to manipulate such files when they contain image data with the Image API. It then introduces you to the task queues used to execute long jobs (such as image manipulation) outside the request process and how to schedule batches of such jobs. The last part shows you how to send and receive e-mails through the Mail API.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Improving Application Performance">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Improving Application Performance</em></span>, begins by showing how to improve application performance using advanced features of Datastore. It then shows you how to use the cache provided by App Engine and how to break the application into smaller services using Modules.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Storing Data in Google Cloud SQL">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Storing Data in Google Cloud SQL</em></span>, is dedicated to the Google Cloud SQL service. It shows you how to create and manage a database instance and how to connect and perform queries. It then demonstrates how an App Engine application can save and retrieve data and how to use a local MySQL installation during development.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Using Channels to Implement a Real-time Application">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Using Channels to Implement a Real-time Application</em></span>, shows you how to make our application real time, in other words, how to update what clients see without reloading the page in the browser. The first part shows how the Channel API works, what happens when a client connects, and what roundtrip of a message is from the server to the client. Then, it shows you how to add a real-time feature to our application from previous chapters.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Building an Application with Django">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building an Application with Django</em></span>, teaches you how to build an App Engine application using the Django web framework instead of webapp2. The first part shows you how to configure the local environment for development, and then the application from previous chapters is rewritten using some of the features provided by Django. The last part shows you how to deploy the application on a production server.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Exposing a REST API with Google Cloud Endpoints">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Exposing a REST API with Google Cloud Endpoints</em></span>, shows you how to rewrite part of our application to expose data through a REST API. The first part explores all the operations needed to set up and configure a project and how to implement a couple of endpoints for our API. The last part shows explores how to add OAuth protection to the API endpoints.</p></div></div>

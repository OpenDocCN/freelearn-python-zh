  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref06"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>Today, organizations encounter an ever-increasing delivery frequency problem. The days of delivering a new version every few years are long gone. The test-driven development process enables individuals and teams to deliver code that is not only robust but maintainable as well. Combine this with the rapid development speed of the Python language and you have a combination that enables the delivery of new features at the pace demanded by the market.</p><p>
<em>Test-Driven Python Development</em> covers the end-to-end unit testing process, from the first simple test to complex tests that involve multiple components and interactions.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Test-Driven Development">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Test-Driven Development</em>, is the introductory chapter. It eases you into the TDD process by setting the context of why we need TDD and quickly getting started with a test.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Red-Green-Refactor – The TDD Cycle">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Red-Green-Refactor – The TDD Cycle</em>, goes deeper into the TDD process, driving the implementation of our example project as we write more tests.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Code Smells and Refactoring">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Code Smells and Refactoring</em>, explores common types of smelly code, and we go back to our example project and clean up the smells we find. A key benefit of TDD is that it provides a safety net so that we can go in and clean up messy code.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using Mock Objects to Test Interactions">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Using Mock Objects to Test Interactions</em>, shows the use of mocking to implement the parts of our example project that depend on other systems. How do you test code that depends on external subsystems? We answer that question here by introducing mock objects.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Working with Legacy Code">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Working with Legacy Code</em>, is about the fact that we often need to clean up or add features to old code that doesn't have existing tests. This chapter looks at strategies for doing this by working through one of the modules in our sample application.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Maintaining Your Test Suite">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Maintaining Your Test Suite</em>, proves that unit tests are also code and good coding practices apply to test code as well. This means keeping them well organized and easy to maintain. This chapter covers techniques to do just that.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Executable Documentation with doctest">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Executable Documentation with doctest</em>, goes through the usage of doctest by working through one of the modules of our application.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Extending unittest with nose2">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Extending unittest with nose2</em>, gives us a look at nose2, a powerful test runner and plugin suite that extends the unittest framework.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Unit Testing Patterns">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Unit Testing Patterns</em>, covers some other patterns for unit testing. We see how to speed up tests and how we can run specific subsets of tests. We also take a look at data-driven tests and mocking patterns.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Tools to Improve Test-Driven Development">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Tools to Improve Test-Driven Development</em>, explains some popular third-party tools to help us improve our TDD practice. Some of these tools, such as py.test and trial, are test runners with some unique features.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Answers to Exercises">Appendix A</a>, <em>Answers to Exercises</em>, contains the answers to the exercises presented throughout this book. There are many possible solutions, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apb.html" title="Appendix B. Working with Older Python Versions">Appendix B</a>, <em>Working with Older Python Versions</em>, describes the changes needed in order to apply the techniques in this book for older versions of Python because this book has been written for Python 3.4.</p></div></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You'll need the following software for this book: Python 3.4, nose 2, and lettuce.</p></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for Python developers who want to use the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) to create efficient and robust applications. In order to get the best out of this book, you should have development experience with Python.</p></div></div>


  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <code class="literal">include</code> directive."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">import unittest
class StockTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_price_of_a_new_stock_class_should_be_None(self):
        stock = Stock("GOOG")
        self.assertIsNone(stock.price)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">class Stock:
    <strong>LONG_TERM_TIMESPAN = 10</strong>
    <strong>SHORT_TERM_TIMESPAN = 5</strong>
</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>python3 -m unittest discover</strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Select the <strong>Publish JUnit test result report</strong> checkbox and enter the location of the nose2 unit test XML file."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div></div>

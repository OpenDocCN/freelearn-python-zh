<h3 id="toc_1">4.1 What is an Algorithm?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In technical terms, an algorithm<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_1" id="Link_To_Endnote_1">[1]</a></sup> is a strictly defined finite sequence of well-defined statements (often called instructions or commands) that provides the solution to a problem or to a specific class of problems for any acceptable set of input values (if there are any inputs). In other words, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a given problem. The term finite means that the algorithm must reach an end point and cannot run forever.</p>
<p class="my_basic">You can find algorithms everywhere in your real life, not just in computer science. For instance, the process of preparing toast or a cup of tea can be expressed as an algorithm. Certain steps, in a particular order, must be followed to achieve your goal.</p>
<h3 id="toc_2">4.2 The Algorithm for Making a Cup of Tea</h3>
<p class="my_basic">The following is an algorithm for making a cup of tea.</p>
<p>1)Put a teabag in a cup.</p>
<p>2)Fill a kettle with water.</p>
<p>3)Boil the water in the kettle.</p>
<p>4)Pour some of the boiled water into the cup.</p>
<p>5)Add milk to the cup.</p>
<p>6)Add sugar to the cup.</p>
<p>7)Stir the tea.</p>
<p>8)Drink the tea.</p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see, certain steps must be followed. These steps are in a specific order, even though some of the steps could be rearranged. For example, steps 5 and 6 can be reversed. You could add the sugar first, and the milk afterwards.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Keep in mind that the order of some steps can probably be changed but you can't move them far away from where they should be. For example, you can't move step 3 (“Boil the water in the kettle.”) to the end of the algorithm, because you will end up drinking a cup of iced tea (and not a warm one) which is totally different from your initial goal!</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_3">4.3 Properties of an Algorithm</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In his book The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms, Donald E. Knuth<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_3" id="Link_To_Endnote_3">[3]</a></sup> asserts that an algorithm must satisfy the following five properties:</p>
<p>►Input: The algorithm must have input values from a specified set.</p>
<p>►Output: The algorithm must produce the output values from a specified set of input values. The output values are the solution to a problem.</p>
<p>►Finiteness: For any input, the algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.</p>
<p>►Definiteness: All steps of the algorithm must be precisely defined. Every instruction within the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. An algorithm must explicitly describe how the computation is to be carried out. The property of definiteness ensures that the agent executing the instructions will always know which command to perform next. Some examples of algorithms that do not satisfy the property of definiteness are:</p>
<p>►an algorithm that involves dividing a number by zero without any checks or safeguards. Dividing by zero is mathematically undefined, and an algorithm that doesn't handle this scenario can lead to unexpected results or errors in the computation.</p>
<p>►an algorithm that attempts to calculate the square root of a negative number without accounting for complex numbers. The square root of a negative number is not a real number but a complex one. If the algorithm doesn't handle this properly, it might produce invalid or nonsensical results.</p>
<p>►Effectiveness: It refers to the ability of an algorithm to consistently and accurately produce a meaningful and correct result for all possible valid inputs (including edge cases) within a finite amount of time. The steps of the algorithm must be basic enough so that, for example, someone using a pencil and paper could carry them out exactly.</p>
<h3 id="toc_4">4.4 Okay About Algorithms. But What is a Computer Program Anyway?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">A computer program is nothing more than an algorithm that is written in a language that computers can understand, like Python, Java, C++, or C#.</p>
<p class="my_basic">A computer program cannot actually make you a cup of tea or cook your dinner, although an algorithm can guide you through the steps to do it yourself. However, programs can (for example) be used to calculate the average value of a set of numbers, or to find the maximum value among them. Artificial intelligence programs can even play chess or solve logic puzzles.</p>
<h3 id="toc_5">4.5 The Three Parties!</h3>
<p class="my_basic">There are always three parties involved in an algorithm—the one that writes the algorithm, the one that executes it, and the one that uses or enjoys it.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's take an algorithm for preparing a meal, for example. Someone writes the algorithm (the author of the recipe book), someone executes it (probably your mother, who prepares the meal following the steps from the recipe book), and someone uses it (probably you, who enjoys the meal).</p>
<p class="my_basic">Now consider a real computer program. Let's take a video game, for example. Someone writes the algorithm in a computer language (the programmer), something executes it (usually a laptop or a computer), and someone uses it or plays with it (the user).</p>
<p class="my_basic">Be cautious, as sometimes the terms “programmer” and “user” can be a source of ambiguity. When you write a computer program, you temporarily assume the role of “the programmer” but when you use your own program, you take on the role of “the user”.</p>
<h3 id="toc_6">4.6 The Three Main Stages Involved in Creating an Algorithm</h3>
<p class="my_basic">An algorithm should consist of three stages: data input, data processing, and results output. This order is specific and cannot be changed.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Consider a computer program that finds the average value of three numbers. First, the program must prompt (ask) the user to enter the numbers (the data input stage). Next, the program must calculate the average value of the numbers (the data processing stage). Finally, the program must display the result on the computer's screen (the results output stage).</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's take a look at these stages in more detail.</p>
<p class="strong_intended">First stage – Data input</p>
<p>1)Prompt the user to enter a number.</p>
<p>2)Prompt the user to enter a second number.</p>
<p>3)Prompt the user to enter a third number.</p>
<p class="strong_intended">Second stage – Data processing</p>
<p>4)Calculate the sum of the three numbers.</p>
<p>5)Divide the sum by 3.</p>
<p class="strong_intended">Third stage – Results output</p>
<p>6)Display the result on the screen.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In some rare situations, the input stage may be absent and the computer program may consist of only two stages. For example, consider a computer program that is written to calculate the following sum.</p>
<p class="my_basic center">1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this example, the user must enter no values at all because the computer program knows exactly what to do. It must calculate the sum of the numbers 1 to 5 and then display the value of 15 on the user's screen. The two required stages (data processing and results output) are shown here.</p>
<p class="strong_intended">First stage – Data input</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">Nothing to do</p>
<p class="strong_intended">Second stage – Data processing</p>
<p>1)Calculate the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.</p>
<p class="strong_intended">Third stage – Results output</p>
<p>2)Display the result on the screen.</p>
<p class="my_basic">However, what if you want to let the user decide the upper limit of that sum? What if you want to let the user decide whether to sum the numbers 1 to 5 or the numbers 1 to 20? In that case, the program must include an input stage at the beginning of the program to let the user enter that upper limit. Once the user enters that upper limit, the computer can calculate the result. The three required stages are shown here.</p>
<p class="strong_intended">First stage – Data input</p>
<p>1)Prompt the user to enter a number.</p>
<p class="strong_intended">Second stage – Data processing</p>
<p>2)Calculate the sum 1 + 2 + … (up to and including the upper limit the user entered).</p>
<p class="strong_intended">Third stage – Results output</p>
<p>3)Display the results on the screen.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For example, if the user enters the number 6 as the upper limit, the computer would find the result of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.</p>
<h3 id="toc_7">4.7 Flowcharts</h3>
<p class="my_basic">A flowchart is a graphical method of presenting an algorithm, usually on paper. It is the visual representation of the algorithm's flow of execution. In other words, it visually represents how the flow of execution proceeds from one statement to the next until the end of the algorithm is reached. The basic symbols that flowcharts use are shown in Table 4-1.</p>
<div><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="my_table">

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Design an algorithm that calculates the average value of three numbers. Whenever the average value is below 10, a message “Fail!” must be displayed. Otherwise, if the average value is 10 or above, a message “Pass!” must be displayed.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this problem, two different messages must be displayed, but only one can appear each time the algorithm is executed; the wording of the message depends on the average value. The flowchart for the algorithm is presented here.</p>

<p class="my_basic">Of course it is very soon for you to start creating your own algorithms. This particular exercise is quite simple and is presented in this chapter as an exception, just for demonstration purposes. You need to learn more before you start creating your own algorithms or even Python programs. Just be patient! In a few chapters the big moment will come!</p>
<h3 id="toc_9">4.8 What are ”Reserved Words”?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In a computer language, a reserved word (or keyword) is a word that has a strictly predefined meaning—it is reserved for special use and cannot be used for any other purpose. For example, the words Start, End, Read, and Write in flowcharts have a predefined meaning. They are used to represent the beginning, the end, the data input, and the results output, respectively.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Reserved words exist in all high-level computer languages. In Python, there are many reserved words such as if, while, else, and for. However, each language has its own set of reserved words. For example, the reserved words else if in C++ are written as elif in Python.</p>
<h3 id="toc_10">4.9 What is the Difference Between a Statement and a Command?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">There is a big discussion on the Internet about whether there is, or is not, any difference between a statement and a command. Some people prefer to use the term “statement”, and some others the term “command”. For a novice programmer, there is no difference; both are instructions to the computer!</p>
<h3 id="toc_11">4.10 What is Structured Programming?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">The structured programming concept was formalized in 1966 by Corrado Böhm<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_4" id="Link_To_Endnote_4">[4]</a></sup> and Giuseppe Jacopini<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_5" id="Link_To_Endnote_5">[5]</a></sup>. They demonstrated theoretical computer program design using sequences, decisions, and iterations.</p>
<h3 id="toc_12">4.11 The Three Fundamental Control Structures</h3>
<p class="my_basic">There are three fundamental control structures in structured programming.</p>
<p>►Sequence Control Structure: This refers to the line-by-line execution, in which statements are executed sequentially, in the same order in which they appear in the program, without skipping any of them. It is also known as a sequential control structure.</p>
<p>►Decision Control Structure: Depending on whether a condition is true or false, the decision control structure may skip the execution of an entire block of statements or even execute one block of statements instead of another. It is also known as a selection control structure.</p>
<p>►Loop Control Structure: This is a control structure that allows the execution of a block of statements multiple times until a specified condition is met. It is also known as an iteration control structure or a repetition control structure.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Every computer program around the world is written in terms of only these three control structures!</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_13">Exercise 4.11-1 Understanding Control Structures Using Flowcharts</h4>

<p class="my_basic">If you didn't quite understand the deeper meaning of these three control structures, don't worry, because upcoming chapters will analyze them very thoroughly. Patience is a virtue. All you have to do for now is wait!</p>
<h3 id="toc_14">4.12 Your First Python Program</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Converting a flowchart to a computer language such as Python results in a Python program. A Python program is nothing more than a text file including Python statements. Python programs can even be written in your text editor application! Keep in mind, though, that using IDLE or Visual Studio Code to write Python programs is a much better solution due to all of their included features that can make your life easier.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>A Python source code is saved on your hard disk with the default  .py file extension.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Here is a very simple algorithm that displays three messages on the screen.</p>

<p class="my_basic">And here is the same algorithm written as a Python program.</p>
<div><p>print("Hello World!")</p>
<p>print("Hallo Welt!")</p>
<p>print("The End")</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_15">4.13 What is the Difference Between a Syntax Error, a Logic Error, and a Runtime Error?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">When high-level language code is written or executed, three types of errors may occur: syntax errors, logic errors, and runtime errors.</p>
<p class="my_basic">A syntax error is a mistake such as a misspelled keyword, a missing punctuation character, or a missing closing bracket. The syntax errors are detected by the compiler or the interpreter. If you try to execute a Python program that contains a syntax error, you will get an error message on your screen and the program won't execute. You must correct any errors and then try to execute the program again.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Some IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, detect these errors as you type and underline the erroneous statements with a wavy red line.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">A logic error is an error that prevents your program from doing what you expected it to do. With logic errors you get no warning at all. Your code compiles and runs but the result is not the expected one. Logic errors are hard to detect. You must review your program thoroughly to find out where your error is. For example, consider a Python program that prompts the user to enter three numbers, and then calculates and displays their average value. In this program, however, the programmer made a typographical error (a “typo”); one of their statements divides the sum of the three numbers by 5, and not by 3 as it should. Of course the Python program executes as normal, without any error messages, prompting the user to enter three numbers and displaying a result, but obviously not the correct one! It is the programmer's responsibility to find and correct the erroneously written Python statement, not the computer, the interpreter or the compiler! Computers are not that smart after all!</p>
<p class="my_basic">A runtime error is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. A runtime error can cause a program to end abruptly or even cause system shut-down. Such errors are the most difficult errors to detect. There is no way to be sure, before executing the program, whether this error is going to happen, or not. You can suspect that it may happen though! For example, running out of memory or a division by zero causes a runtime error.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>A logic error can be the cause of a runtime error!</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Logic errors and runtime errors are commonly referred to as "bugs", and are often found during the debugging process, before the software is released. When errors are found after a software has been released to the public, programmers often release patches, or small updates, to fix the errors.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_16">4.14 What “Debugging” Means</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Debugging is the process of finding and reducing the number of defects (bugs) in a computer program, in order to make it perform as expected.</p>
<p class="my_basic">There is a myth about the origin of the term “debugging”. In 1940, while Grace Hopper<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_6" id="Link_To_Endnote_6">[6]</a></sup> was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a bug (a moth) stuck in a relay (an electrically operated switch). This bug was blocking the proper operation of the Mark II computer. So, while her associates where trying to remove the bug, Grace Hopper remarked that they were “debugging” the system!</p>
<h3 id="toc_17">4.15 Commenting Your Code</h3>
<p class="my_basic">When you write a small and easy program, anyone can understand how it works just by reading it line-by-line. However, long programs are difficult to understand, sometimes even by the same person who wrote them.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Comments are extra information that can be included in a program to make it easier to read and understand. Using comments, you can add explanations and other pieces of information, including:</p>
<p>►who wrote the program</p>
<p>►when the program was created or last modified</p>
<p>►what the program does</p>
<p>►how the program works</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Comments are for human readers. Compilers and interpreters ignore any comments you may add to your programs.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">However, you should not over-comment. There is no need to explain every line of your program. Add comments only when a particular portion of your program is hard to follow.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In Python, you can add comments using the hash character ( # ) as shown here.</p>
<div><p>#Created By Aristides S. Bouras</p>
<p>#Date created: 12/25/2003</p>
<p>#Date modified: 04/03/2008</p>
<p>#Description: This program displays some messages on the screen</p>
<div></div>
<p>print("Hello Zeus!")  #It displays a message on the screen</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Display a second message on the screen</p>
<p>print("Hello Hera!")</p>
<div></div>
<p>#This is a comment        print("The End")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see in the preceding program, you can add comments above a statement or at the end of it, but not in front of it. Look at the last statement, which is supposed to display the message “The End”. This statement is never executed because it is considered part of the comment.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Comments are not visible to the user of a program while the program runs.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_18">4.16 User-Friendly Programs</h3>
<p class="my_basic">What is a user-friendly program? It's one the user considers a friend instead of an enemy, one that is easy for a novice user.</p>
<p class="my_basic">If you want to write user-friendly programs you have to put yourself in the shoes of the user. Users want the computer to do their job their way, with a minimum of effort. Hidden menus, unclear labels and directions, and misleading error messages can all make a program user-unfriendly!</p>
<p class="my_basic">The law that best defines user-friendly designs is the Law of Least Astonishment: “The program should act in a way that least astonishes the user”. This law is also commonly referred to as the Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA).</p>

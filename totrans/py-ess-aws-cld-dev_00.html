<h1 id="_idParaDest-5">Preface</h1>
<p>Cloud computing is one of the most popular approaches to implementing your applications, with huge advantages. There are multiple cloud providers, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. AWS is one of the most used cloud providers, and many companies are moving there. Cloud usage is significantly growing and cloud knowledge is expected <span class="No-Break">from developers.</span></p>
<p>Most of the applications are moving to the cloud. AWS has different services to implement Python applications, hence the configuration and selecting the right service is a challenge for those who don’t have an AWS background. By buying this book, you are on the right path and stepping into how to implement cool Python applications using <span class="No-Break">AWS services.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6">Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is implemented for cloud developers, software developers, and IT specialists who intend to develop Python applications on AWS as well as learn about the concepts of appropriate AWS services for implementing the Python applications. You should have Python programming experience to implement the applications <span class="No-Break">on AWS.</span></p>

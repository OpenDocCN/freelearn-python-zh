  <div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref06"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>Internet of Things, also known as IoT, is changing the way we live and represents one of the biggest challenges in the IT industry. Developers are creating low-cost devices that collect huge amounts of data, interact with each other, and take advantage of cloud services and cloud-based storage. Makers all over the world are working on fascinating projects that transform everyday objects into smart devices with sensors and actuators.</p><p>A coffee cup is not a simple object anymore—it can send a message to your smartwatch indicating that the liquid inside has the right temperature so that you can drink it without worrying about checking whether it is too hot. In case you move the coffee cup before you receive the message, your wearable vibrates to indicate that you don't have to drink it yet.</p><p>You can check the coffee level of the coffee dispenser in your smartphone, and you won't have to worry about ordering more coffee: the coffee dispenser will automatically place an online order to request coffee when the coffee level is not enough to cover the rest of the day. You just need to approve the online order that the coffee dispenser suggests from your smartwatch. Based on certain statistical algorithms, the coffee dispenser will know the appropriate time to make the order.</p><p>What happens when more usual visitors arrive at the office? Their smartwatches or smartphones will communicate with the coffee dispensers and they will place orders in case the probable consumption of decaffeinated coffee increases too much. We have smart coffee cups, smart coffee dispensers, smartwatches, smartphones, and wearables. All of them take advantage of the cloud to create a smart ecosystem capable of providing us with all the different types of coffees we need for our day.</p><p>The Intel Galileo Gen 2 board is an extremely powerful and versatile minicomputer board for IoT projects. We can boot a Linux version and easily execute Python scripts that can interact with the different components included on the board. This book will teach you to develop IoT prototypes, from selecting the hardware to all the necessary stacks with Python 2.7.3, its libraries, and tools. In case you need a smaller board or an alternative, all the examples included in the book are compatible with Intel Edison boards, and therefore, you can switch to this board in case you need to.</p><p>Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It is open source, multiplatform, and you can use it to develop any kind of application, from websites to extremely complex scientific computing applications. There is always a Python package that makes things easier for us in order to avoid reinventing the wheel and solve problems faster. Python is an ideal choice for developing a complete IoT stack. This book covers all the things you need to know to transform everyday objects into IoT projects.</p><p>This book will allow you to prototype and develop IoT solutions from scratch with Python as the programming language. You will leverage your existing Python knowledge to capture data from the real world, interact with physical objects, develop APIs, and use different IoT protocols. You will use specific libraries to easily work with low-level hardware, sensors, actuators, buses, and displays. You will learn how to take advantage of all the Python packages with the Intel Galileo Gen 2 board. You will be ready to become a maker and to be a part of the exciting IoT world.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Understanding and Setting up the Base IoT Hardware">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Understanding and Setting up the Base IoT Hardware</em>, start us off on our journey towards Internet of Things (IoT) with Python and the Intel Galileo Gen 2 board. We will learn the different features offered by this board and visualize its different components. We will understand the meaning of the different pins, LEDs, and connectors. We will learn to check the board's firmware version and to update if necessary.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Working with Python on Intel Galileo Gen 2">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Working with Python on Intel Galileo Gen 2</em>, leads us through many procedures that make it possible to work with Python as the main programming language to create IoT projects with our Intel Galileo Gen 2 board. We will write a Linux Yocto image to a microSD card, configure the board to make it boot this image, update many libraries to use their latest versions, and launch the Python interpreter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Interacting with Digital Outputs with Python">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Interacting with Digital Outputs with Python</em>, teaches us how to work with two different libraries to control digital outputs in Python: mraa and wiring-x86. We will connect LEDs and resistors to a breadboard and write code to turn on between 0 to 9 LEDs. Then, we will improve our Python code to take advantage of Python's object-oriented features, and we will prepare the code to make it easy to build an API that will allow us to print numbers with LEDs with a REST API.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Working with a RESTful API and Pulse Width Modulation">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Working with a RESTful API and Pulse Width Modulation</em>, has us working with Tornado Web Server, Python, the HTTPie command-line HTTP client, and the mraa and wiring-x86 libraries. We will generate many versions of RESTful APIs that will allow us to interact with the board in computers and devices connected to the LAN. We will be able to compose and send HTTP requests that print numbers in LEDs, change the brightness levels for three LEDs, and generate millions of colors with an RGB LED.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Working with Digital Inputs, Polling and Interrupts">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Working with Digital Inputs, Polling and Interrupts</em>, explains the difference between reading pushbutton statuses with polling and working with interrupts and interrupt handlers. We will write code that will allow the user to perform the same actions with either pushbuttons in the breadboard or HTTP requests. We will combine code that reacts to changes in the statuses of the pushbuttons with a RESTful API built with Tornado Web Server. We will create classes to encapsulate pushbuttons and the necessary configurations with the mraa and wiring-x86 libraries.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Working with Analog Inputs and Local Storage">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Working with Analog Inputs and Local Storage</em>, explains how to work with analog inputs to measure voltage values. We will measure voltages with an analog pin and both the mraa and the wiring-x86 libraries. We will be able to transform a variable resistor into a voltage source and make it possible to measure the darkness level with an analog input, a photoresistor, and a voltage divider. We will fire actions when the environment light changes, and we will work with both analog inputs and outputs. We will register events by taking advantage of the logging features included in the Python standard library and the USB 2.0 connector included in the Intel Galileo Gen 2 board.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Retrieving Data from the Real World with Sensors">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Retrieving Data From the Real World with Sensors</em>, has us working with a variety of sensors to retrieve data from the real world. We will take advantage of the modules and classes included in the upm library that will make it easy for us to start working with analog and digital sensors. We will learn the importance of considering units of measurement because sensors always provide values measured in a specific unit, which we must consider. We will measure the magnitude and direction of proper acceleration or g-force, ambient temperature, and humidity.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Displaying Information and Performing Actions">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Displaying Information and Performing Actions</em>, teaches us about different displays the we can connect to our board through the I<sup>2</sup>C bus. We will work with an LCD display with an RGB backlight, and we will then replace it with an OLED dot matrix. We will write code that takes advantage of the modules and classes included in the upm library to work with LCD and OLED displays and show text on them. We will also write code that interacts with an analog servo. We will control the shaft to allow us to create a gauge chart to display the temperature value retrieved with a sensor. Our Python code will make things move.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Working with the Cloud">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Working with the Cloud</em>, teaches you how to combine many cloud-based services that will allow us to easily publish data collected from sensors and visualize it in a web-based dashboard. We will work with the MQTT protocol and its publish/subscribe model to process commands in our board and indicate when the commands are successfully processed through messages. First, we will work with the PubNub cloud that works with the MQTT protocol under the hood. Then, we will develop the same example with Mosquitto and Eclipse Paho. We will be able to write applications that can establish bidirectional communications with our IoT devices.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Analyzing Huge Amounts of Data with Cloud-based IoT Analytics">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Analyzing Huge Amounts of Data with Cloud-based IoT Analytics</em>, explains the close relationship between IoT and Big Data. We will work with Intel IoT Analytics, a cloud-based service that allows us to organize huge amounts of data collected by multiple IoT devices and their sensors. We will use the requests package to write a few lines of Python code to interact with the Intel IoT Analytics REST API. We will learn about the different options that Intel IoT Analytics offers us to analyze huge amounts of data, and we will define rules to trigger alerts.</p></div></div></div>

<p>In the third edition of this book, we will explore the beautiful world of<span> </span><strong>graphical user interfaces</strong><span> </span>(<strong>GUIs</strong>) using the Python programming language. We will be using the latest version of Python 3. All of the recipes from the first and second editions are included in this edition, except for the outdated<span> </span><kbd>OpenGL</kbd><span> </span>library, which is not very Pythonic, after all. We have added an entirely new chapter to the third edition, and we have dramatically changed the style of this third edition to give it more of a cookbook format. By doing so, hopefully, it is easier to apply the recipes to real-world programming situations, providing tested and working solutions.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">This is a programming cookbook. Every chapter is self-contained and explains a certain programming solution. We will start very simply, yet throughout the course of this book, we will build a working application written in Python 3. Each recipe will extend the building of this application. Along the way, we will talk about networks, queues, databases, the PyQt5 graphical library, and many more technologies. We will apply design patterns and use best practices.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">The book assumes that you have some experience of using the Python programming language, but that is not really required to successfully use this book. This book can also be used as an introduction to the Python programming language, if, and only if, you are dedicated in your desire to become a Pythonic programmer.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">If you are an experienced developer in any other language, you will have a fun time extending your professional toolbox by adding the ability to write GUIs using Python to your toolbox.</p>

<p class="NormalPACKT">This book is for programmers who wish to create a GUI. You might be surprised by what we can achieve by creating beautiful, functional, and powerful GUIs using the Python programming language. Python is a wonderful, intuitive programming language, and is very easy to learn.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: .0001pt" class="NormalPACKT">I invite you to start on this journey now. It will be a lot of fun!</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">To make optimum use of the content in this book, please bear the following points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>All the recipes in this book were developed using Python 3.7 on a Windows 10 64-bit OS. They have not been tested on any other configuration. As Python is a cross-platform language, the code from each recipe is expected to run everywhere.</li>
<li>If you are using a Mac, it does come with built-in Python, yet it might be missing some modules such as <kbd>tkinter</kbd>, which we will use throughout this book.</li>
<li>We are using Python 3.7, and the creator of Python intentionally chose not to make it backward-compatible with Python 2. If you are using a Mac or Python 2, you might have to install Python 3.7 from <a href="http://www.python.org"><span class="URLPACKT">www.python.org</span></a> in order to successfully run the recipes in this book.</li>
<li>If you really wish to run the code in this book on Python 2.7, you will have to make some adjustments. For example, <kbd>tkinter</kbd> in Python 2.x has an uppercase <em>T</em>. The Python 2.7 print statement is a function in Python 3.7 and requires parentheses.</li>
<li>While the <strong>End of Life</strong> (<strong>EOL</strong>) for the Python 2.x branch has been extended to the year 2020, I would strongly recommend that you start using Python 3.7 and later.</li>
<li>Why hold on to the past, unless you really have to? Here is a link to the <strong>Python Enhancement Proposal</strong> (<strong>PEP</strong>) 373 that refers to the EOL of Python 2: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/</a>.</li>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Here is an overview of the Python modules (ending in a <kbd>.py</kbd> extension) for this chapter".</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>action = ttk.Button(win, text="Click Me!", command=click_me)<br/>action.grid(column=2, row=1)</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>pip install pyqt5</pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Click on the <span class="packt_screen">File</span> menu and then click on</span> <span class="packt_screen">New</span><span>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>

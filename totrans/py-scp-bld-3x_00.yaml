- en: Blender is a free, open source application for 3D modeling and animation. It
    has evolved over the years and, since version 3.0, is on par with state-of-the-art
    software in many aspects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It provides a Python **Application Programming Interface** (**API**) for automating
    tasks, adding functionalities, and integrating Blender in large productions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is a free, open source programming language for quick yet powerful scripting.
    Its syntax, akin to simplified English, automatic memory management, and ease
    of integration, makes it the standard in software APIs and 3D pipelines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book goes through the steps of the 3D process, starting with the creation
    and manipulation of objects, then animation and deformation follow, with rendering
    as the closing chapter. Though this order is a linear path, every chapter can
    stand on its own, with the exception perhaps of [*Chapter 6*](B18375_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129),
    and [*Chapter 8*](B18375_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206), which rely on examples introduced
    in their immediate predecessor.

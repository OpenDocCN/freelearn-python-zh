    <h1 id="_idParaDest-4" class="mainHeading">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">Data structures play a vital role in storing and organizing data within an application. It is important to choose the right data structure to significantly improve the application’s performance, as it is highly desirable to be able to scale the application as the data quantity increases. This new edition teaches you essential Python data structures and the most common and important algorithms for building easy, maintainable applications. It also allows you to implement these algorithms with working examples and easy to follow step-by-step instructions.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this book, you will learn the essential Python data structures and the most common algorithms. With this easy-to-read book, you will learn how to create complex data structures such as linked lists, stacks, heaps, queues, trees, and graphs as well as sorting algorithms including bubble sort, insertion sort, heapsort, and quicksort. We also describe various selection algorithms such as randomized and deterministic selection and provide a detailed discussion of various data structure algorithms and design paradigms such as greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. In addition, complex data structures such as trees and graphs are explained with easy pictorial examples to understand the concepts of these useful data structures. You will also learn various important string processing and pattern-matching algorithms such as KMP and Boyer-Moore algorithms along with their easy implementation in Python.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="heading-1">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book is intended for Python developers who are studying data structures and algorithms at a beginner or intermediate level, as chapters provide practical examples and an easy approach to complex algorithms. It may also be useful for engineering students on a course in data structures and algorithms, as it covers almost all the algorithms, concepts, and designs that are studied. This book is also designed for software developers who want to deploy various applications using a specific data structures, as this book provides efficient ways to store relevant data.</p>
    <p class="normal">It is assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge of the Python; however, it is not necessary, as we provide a quick overview of Python and object-oriented concepts.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="heading-1">What this book covers</h1>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Python Data Types and Structures</em>, introduces the basic data types and structures in Python.

    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Linked Lists</em>, covers linked lists, which are one of the most common data structures and are often used to implement other structures, such as stacks and queues. In this chapter, we describe linked lists, their operation, and implementation. We compare their behavior to arrays and discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Stacks and Queues</em>, describes stack and queue data structures in detail. It also discusses the behavior and demonstrates some implementations of these linear data structures. We give examples of typical real-life example applications.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Trees</em>, considers how trees form the basis of many of the most important advanced data structures. In this chapter we look at how to implement a binary tree. We will examine how to traverse trees and retrieve and insert values.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Heaps and Priority Queues</em>, looks into priority queues as important data structures and shows how to implement them using heap.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Hash Tables</em>, describes symbol tables, gives some typical implementations, and discusses various applications. We will look at the process of hashing, give an implementation of a hash table, and discuss the various design considerations.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Graphs and Algorithms</em>, looks at some of the more specialized structures, including graphs and spatial structures. We will learn to represent data through nodes and vertices and create structures such as directed and undirected graphs.

    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Sorting</em>, looks at the most common approaches to sorting. This will include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, and heap sort algorithms with detailed explanations, along with their Python implementations.</p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Selection Algorithms</em>, discusses how selection algorithms are commonly used to find the i<sup class="superscript">th</sup> smallest element from the list. It is an important operation related to sorting algorithms, and broadly related to the data structures and algorithms. </p>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">String Matching Algorithms</em>, covers basic concepts and definitions related to strings. In this chapter, various string and pattern matching algorithms are discussed in detail such as the naïve approach, and the <strong class="keyWord">Knuth-Morris-Pratt</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">KMP</strong>) and Boyer-Moore pattern matching algorithms.</p>

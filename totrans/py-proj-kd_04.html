In <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Calculate This!">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Calculate This!</em>, you wrote a calculator program. If you followed the instructions and corrected your errors, then you have a program that runs all of the mathematical functions with two numbers. While this is great for a first program, that sort of a limited calculator doesn't give a user much choice. When the user runs the calculator, the program will not end until all five functions have run or until the program ends due to an error.</p><p>What if, instead of doing the entire math, we could program our calculator to perform certain operations based on the way the users answer our questions? As programmers, we can use Python to interpret user data and change the way the program operates. In this chapter, you will learn how to use <em>control flows</em> so that our calculator program can make choices and only run the code that the user chooses.</p><p>At the end of this chapter, you will have a calculator program that can choose which mathematical operations to perform based on what the user wants to do. You will be able to customize this program on the basis of how you use the control flows.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec30"/>Is it equal, not equal, or something else?</h1></div></div></div><p>Before you<a id="id106" class="indexterm"/> learn about conditional statements, you need to realize that computers make decisions based on <strong>comparison operators</strong>. These help us compare two things so that the computer can make a decision about what to do next. Here is a list of operators:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align: center" valign="bottom">

</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>Not equal to</p>
</td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top">
<p>!=</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Each of these<a id="id107" class="indexterm"/> operators allows us to compare two values. The <a id="id108" class="indexterm"/>most confusing operator is the equal to <a id="id109" class="indexterm"/>operator because it uses two equals signs. The reason for this is that when we set a variable, we use one equal sign. We do<a id="id110" class="indexterm"/> not want <a id="id111" class="indexterm"/>the computer to get confused <a id="id112" class="indexterm"/>when we are comparing two values, so we use two equals signs. When we use the comparison operators with <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">elif</code>, and <code class="literal">else</code>, our program can be written to make better decisions.</p><p>To take <a id="id113" class="indexterm"/>a look at how these operators work in real life, open up your Python shell and type the following lines of code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>1 &lt; 1</strong>
<strong>1 &lt;= 1</strong>
<strong>1 &gt; 1</strong>
<strong>1 &gt;= 1</strong>
<strong>1 == 1</strong>
<strong>1 != 1</strong>
</pre></div><p>After each line of code, the words <code class="literal">True</code> or <code class="literal">False</code> will print. Take a look at the following screenshot for answers to how the statements evaluate using the number <code class="literal">1</code>. Experiment with other numbers to take a look at what happens and to learn about the operators and what they do:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_04_01.jpg" alt="Is it equal, not equal, or something else?"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec31"/>Conditional statements – if, elif, else</h1></div></div></div><p>There are<a id="id114" class="indexterm"/> three language constructs that are used frequently in Python to control the outcome of a program. These constructs are <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">elif</code>, and <code class="literal">else</code>:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <a id="id115" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">if</code> statement <a id="id116" class="indexterm"/>tells the program that <em>if the user does this, then execute this part of the program</em>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <a id="id117" class="indexterm"/><code class="literal">else</code> statement<a id="id118" class="indexterm"/> is used to catch anything that the user does and is not in the program. For example, you can use <code class="literal">if</code> and <code class="literal">else</code> together: <em>if the user chooses </em><code class="literal">add</code><em>, do addition, else do another action.</em><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note08"/>Note</h3><p>The <code class="literal">elif</code> stands for <em>else if</em>, which means that <em>if the first thing does not happen, then do the next thing in the list of possibilities until the user choice matches the possibility</em>.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">elif</code> is <a id="id119" class="indexterm"/>used when you want to give the program more than two choices. You can<a id="id120" class="indexterm"/> use <code class="literal">elif</code> as many times as you like.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">else</code> is a signal of the end of the possible choices to your computer program. The <code class="literal">else</code> means that <em>if none of the other things have taken place in your program, OR if the user has done something unexpected, then end this block of code</em>. <code class="literal">else</code> statements are always at the end of a block of code that begins with <code class="literal">if</code>.</li></ul></div><p>In the next section, you can take a look at how <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">elif</code>, and <code class="literal">else</code> are used. Then, you will experiment with your calculator code, and add some of these statements to make your calculator more flexible.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec23"/>Getting better input</h2></div></div></div><p>In order for <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">elif</code>, and <code class="literal">else</code> to work, we will need<a id="id121" class="indexterm"/> to get better user input. For this to happen, we need to ask better questions! You will see in each example of <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">elif</code>, and <code class="literal">else</code> that we will be adding more <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> statements to get further information from the user. Then, we will put that information to work using the <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">elif</code>, and <code class="literal">else</code> statements so that our calculator program is more responsive to the user's needs.</p><p>To practice asking better questions, let's open our Python shell and practice writing the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>raw_input('add, subtract, multiply, divide, or modulo?')</strong>
</pre></div><p>So, we are now asking the user to choose what operation they want to execute by typing the name of the operation as the answer to the question. When our program runs, it will ask the user this question. How will our program know what to do with the answer?</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec24"/>if</h2></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">if</code> statement tells<a id="id122" class="indexterm"/> the program to do something special <a id="id123" class="indexterm"/>if the user makes a choice. To better understand this, let's use this sample question and ask the user what operation they would like the calculator to do:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_04_10_replace.jpg" alt="if"/></div><p>For the purposes of practicing, let's imagine that our user types <em>addition</em> as their answer. Right now, our program does not know or care that the user wants to do addition. Our program has no way to do anything with that answer! We need to use the <code class="literal">if</code> statement to tell our program what to do.</p><p>So, we <a id="id124" class="indexterm"/>will now create a special function, and we<a id="id125" class="indexterm"/> will tell the computer what to do with this new information from the user. To do this, we will use our text editor to add new code and our command prompt to run the code once we have saved the code. As a reminder, the working directory of your command prompt should be set to your project's folder.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"/>Note</h3><p>You can refer to <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Welcome! Let's Get Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Welcome! Let's Get Started</em>, in case you've forgotten how to find your working directory.</p></div></div><p>Once you have opened your calculator program in your text editor, add this function to the program:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>def calc_run():</strong>
<strong>    op = raw_input('add, subtract, multiply, divide, or modulo?')</strong>
<strong>   if op == 'add':</strong>
<strong>        addition()</strong>
</pre></div><p>Then, call your new <code class="literal">calc_run()</code> function by adding this line to the end of your program file:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>calc_run()</strong>
</pre></div><p>Now, you will erase the calls you made to your addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions throughout the program because we do not need them all the time. We want them to happen only when the user makes the choice.</p><p>In the <code class="literal">calc_run()</code> function that we are creating now, we tell the calculator to ask a question. Once the user answers the question, the computer will check whether the answer is equal to addition. If it is, then the computer will run the addition function.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec25"/>elif</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id126" class="indexterm"/>
<code class="literal">elif</code> statement<a id="id127" class="indexterm"/> lets us give the user many choices, which is much more logical for a user who might want to choose from the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions. Using <code class="literal">elif</code> allows us to give the user the choice between many operations. There is no limit to how many times you can write the <code class="literal">elif</code> statement.</p><p>If you wanted to create a response to 100 different kinds of information, you could write 100 <code class="literal">elif</code> statements. However, this is really tedious, so we won't do it. You can take a look at some of the changes made in the following code, which will show how you can use <code class="literal">elif</code> to give the<a id="id128" class="indexterm"/> user choices for each mathematical operation:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>def calc_run():</strong>
<strong>    op = raw_input('add, subtract, multiply, divide, or modulo? ')</strong>
<strong>   if op == 'add':</strong>
<strong>       addition()</strong>
<strong>   elif op == 'subtract':</strong>
<strong>       subtraction()</strong>
<strong>   elif op == 'multiply':</strong>
<strong>       multiplication()</strong>
<strong>   elif op == 'divide':</strong>
<strong>       division()</strong>
<strong>    elif op == 'modulo':</strong>
<strong>        modulo()</strong>
</pre></div><p>You <a id="id129" class="indexterm"/>will notice that we used four <code class="literal">elif</code> statements. Each <code class="literal">elif</code> matched the response that we wanted. Now, we will test our program. Hopefully, you have saved your work in your text editor. Always remember to save as often as you can!</p><div><img src="img/B04681_04_03.jpg" alt="elif"/></div><p>Try <a id="id130" class="indexterm"/>running<a id="id131" class="indexterm"/> your program by following these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open your command prompt or terminal.</li><li class="listitem">Navigate to your project folder.</li><li class="listitem">Type <code class="literal">python</code> <code class="literal">first_calc.py</code>.<div><img src="img/B04681_04_04.jpg" alt="elif"/></div></li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec26"/>else</h2></div></div></div><p><code class="literal">else</code> is <a id="id132" class="indexterm"/>a way to manage all the other things that a<a id="id133" class="indexterm"/> user might do that we cannot predict. When the user enters something to trigger <code class="literal">else</code>, we can return a message to them, or we can even end the program. Your program does not <em>NEED</em> to use an <code class="literal">else</code> statement; however, it is nice to make the choices that you want for your users, and make them as clear as possible. In the following example, we will print a message to the user if they do <em>NOT</em> choose add, subtract, multiply, divide, or modulo:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>def calc_run():</strong>
<strong>    op = raw_input('add, subtract, multiply, divide, or modulo? ')</strong>

<strong>       subtraction()</strong>
<strong>   elif op == 'multiply':</strong>
<strong>       multiplication()</strong>
<strong>   elif op == 'divide':</strong>
<strong>       division()</strong>
<strong>    elif op == 'modulo':</strong>
<strong>        modulo()</strong>
<strong>   else:</strong>
<strong>       print('Thank you. Goodbye')</strong>
</pre></div><div><img src="img/B04681_04_05.jpg" alt="else"/></div><p>Now, when<a id="id134" class="indexterm"/> you run the code, if you type an answer<a id="id135" class="indexterm"/> that is not addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, your program should print <code class="literal">Thank you. Goodbye</code>. Test your program to check whether your <code class="literal">else</code> statement works!</p><div><img src="img/B04681_04_06.jpg" alt="else"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec32"/>Loops</h1></div></div></div><p><strong>Loops</strong><a id="id136" class="indexterm"/> are a kind of control flow, but they rerun the same block of code over and over again until something else tells the loop to stop repeating itself. This is a bit different from conditional statements since these only run the block of code once. The two kinds of loop are <code class="literal">while</code> and <code class="literal">for</code>. Both types of loop are really useful.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec27"/>while</h2></div></div></div><p><strong>while</strong><a id="id137" class="indexterm"/> is one<a id="id138" class="indexterm"/> kind of loop. When we make a <code class="literal">while</code> loop, the program repeats itself until a given block of code happens. When programming a <code class="literal">while</code> loop, we need to create some rules, or our program will run forever.</p><p>For example, we can make this rule: when the calculator is on, perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Run the calculator.</li><li class="listitem">Prompt the user to keep calculating.</li><li class="listitem">When the user hits the <code class="literal">else</code> statement, turn the calculator off.</li></ol></div><p>Let's go <a id="id139" class="indexterm"/>through each of the code changes step by step; you will need these changes in order to make the <code class="literal">while</code> loop work.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec11"/>Global variables and the quit() function</h3></div></div></div><p>We will <a id="id140" class="indexterm"/>create a global variable to use in our <code class="literal">quit()</code> function. Using the variable in this way will allow us to let the <code class="literal">quit ()</code> function act like an <code class="literal">off</code> switch, thus stopping our <code class="literal">calc_run()</code> function from running. In the next section, we will write our global variable, and then we will create our <code class="literal">quit()</code> function.</p><p>First, we will make a global variable called <code class="literal">calc_on</code>. This is one way for us to make an <code class="literal">on</code> button for our computer calculator. This global variable should be typed at the top of the code file with the <em>NO</em> indentation:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>calc_on = 1</strong>
</pre></div><p>Global variables can be used in any function we want throughout the program. If you want to use a global variable in a function, you can type <code class="literal">global</code> next to the name of the variable inside of the function. You will be shown an example of this later on.</p><p>Now that we have an <em>on button</em> global variable that can be used anywhere in our code, we will create the pieces needed for our <code class="literal">while</code> loop. We need to add a way for our program to keep repeating itself so that the user can keep doing calculations without restarting the program for each calculation. Also, we need to add a way for the user to quit the program. We are going to work backward and make the <code class="literal">quit()</code> function first:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>def quit():</strong>
<strong>  global calc_on</strong>
<strong>  calc_on = 0</strong>
</pre></div><p>We just wrote the code for our <code class="literal">quit()</code> function. The first line uses our <code class="literal">calc_on</code> global variable. The second line changes the value of <code class="literal">calc_on</code> to <code class="literal">0</code>. By changing the value from <code class="literal">1</code> to <code class="literal">0</code>, we are telling the program to turn the calculator off and stop running the code.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec12"/>Using the quit() function</h3></div></div></div><p>In our code, we<a id="id141" class="indexterm"/> are going to change our <code class="literal">else</code> statement so that it runs the <code class="literal">quit()</code> function instead of printing a message. Take a look at this code sample to understand the changes we make to else:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>def calc_run():</strong>
<strong>    op = raw_input('add, subtract, multiply, divide, or modulo? ')</strong>
<strong>   if op == 'add':</strong>
<strong>       addition()</strong>
<strong>   elif op == 'subtract':</strong>
<strong>       subtraction()</strong>
<strong>   elif op == 'multiply':</strong>
<strong>       multiplication()</strong>
<strong>   elif op == 'divide':</strong>
<strong>       division()</strong>
<strong>    elif op == 'modulo':</strong>
<strong>        modulo()</strong>
<strong>   else:</strong>
<strong>       quit()</strong>
</pre></div><p>Now that we have made the <code class="literal">on</code> button, <code class="literal">calc_on</code>, the <code class="literal">off</code> button, and <code class="literal">quit()</code>, we can add the <code class="literal">quit</code> choice to our program. In the line of code where we get information from the user, we will add the word <code class="literal">quit</code> as a choice:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>op = raw_input('add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo, quit?')</strong>
</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec13"/>Using the while loop to control the program</h3></div></div></div><p>Quitting<a id="id142" class="indexterm"/> is one choice that the user can make by simply typing <code class="literal">quit</code>. However, we want to allow the user to keep the program running if they wish to. To do this, we will use a <code class="literal">while</code> loop. At the bottom of the code, we will simply write this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>while calc_on == 1:</strong>
<strong>    calc_run()</strong>
</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">while</code> loop is says that <em>while the on button is on, run the </em><code class="literal">calc_run()</code><em> function. If someone does something to change </em><code class="literal">calc_on</code><em> to a value that is not </em><code class="literal">1</code><em>, then stop running the </em><code class="literal">calc_run()</code><em> program.</em></p><p>Hopefully, you noticed that our <code class="literal">quit()</code> function changes the value of <code class="literal">calc_on</code> to <code class="literal">0</code>, which means that our program stops running. <code class="literal">while</code> loops are very useful for running run parts of a program, and they can use simple variables to start or stop the loops, which is similar to what we did with this calculator:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_04_07.jpg" alt="Using the while loop to control the program"/></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec28"/>for</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id143" class="indexterm"/>
<code class="literal">for</code> loop<a id="id144" class="indexterm"/> is another kind of loop. We will use the <code class="literal">for</code> loop to make a bonus function for our calculator. The biggest difference between <code class="literal">for</code> and <code class="literal">while</code> is that the <code class="literal">for</code> loop is used when a programmer knows exactly how many times they need the loop to repeat. In the <code class="literal">while</code> loop, we do not know when the user will be done with the calculator. The user might want to make one calculation or they might want to make 10, and a <code class="literal">while</code> loop is flexible. A <code class="literal">for</code> loop is more rigid.</p><p>Why not just use <code class="literal">while</code> all the time, then? Well, there are times when we know just what it will take to get a job done, and we do not want the program to keep going any more after the job is done. The <code class="literal">for</code> loop is perfect for saying how many times to repeat a loop. For example, let's say that you have a list of numbers, and you want to print all the numbers in the list. Let's say that you want to print the numbers <code class="literal">1</code> through <code class="literal">10</code>. If you had to write them out individually, it would look like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  print(1)</strong>
<strong>  print(2)</strong>
<strong>  print(3)</strong>
<strong>  print(4)</strong>
<strong>  print(5)</strong>
<strong>  print(6)</strong>
<strong>  print(7)</strong>
<strong>  print(8)</strong>
<strong>  print(9)</strong>
<strong>  print(10)</strong>
</pre></div><p>This is a lot of <a id="id145" class="indexterm"/>lines of code, and they are all doing the same thing! What a waste of space, and what a waste of time to type this all out. Instead of typing the preceding code, type the code in the following <code class="literal">for</code> loop:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  for n in range(1, 11):</strong>
<strong>      print(n)</strong>
</pre></div><div><img src="img/B04681_04_08.jpg" alt="for"/></div><p>First, you see that we typed <code class="literal">n</code> in <code class="literal">range(1, 11)</code>. This means <em>every number between </em><code class="literal">1</code><em> and </em><code class="literal">11</code><em>, not including </em><code class="literal">11</code>.</p><p>You will also notice that we called a function named <code class="literal">range()</code>, which is a built-in Python function that allows us to specify a range of numbers instead of writing them all out. The <code class="literal">range()</code> function does <em>NOT</em> include the last number, so you can see that the second number is <code class="literal">11</code>, instead of <code class="literal">10</code>.</p><p>You can experiment with these numbers in the range by expanding it to <code class="literal">range(1, 1000)</code>. What happens now? This is a basic <code class="literal">for</code> loop, but we will find that using this <code class="literal">for</code> loop is very helpful when we want to repeat code for lists of numbers, letters, words, or objects.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec14"/>Bonus – count_to_ten() function</h3></div></div></div><p>To make<a id="id146" class="indexterm"/> our calculator a little more interesting, let's create a <code class="literal">count</code> function that will print the numbers from <code class="literal">1</code> to <code class="literal">10</code>. We can then add this function to our list of choices. First, think about how we used the preceding <code class="literal">for</code> loop. Then, copy the <code class="literal">count_to_ten()</code> function between the <code class="literal">modulo()</code> function and the <code class="literal">quit()</code> function into your <code class="literal">first_calc.py</code> program:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  def count_to_ten()</strong>
<strong>      for number in range(1, 11):</strong>
<strong>               print(number)</strong>
</pre></div><p>Add the choice <code class="literal">ten</code> to your <code class="literal">op</code> variable, like this:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>       op = raw_input('add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo, ten, or quit?')</strong>
</pre></div><p>Finally, add <code class="literal">elif</code> for <code class="literal">ten</code> to your control flow of <code class="literal">if</code>/<code class="literal">elif</code>/<code class="literal">else</code>:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong>  elif op == 'ten':</strong>
<strong>      count_to_ten()</strong>
</pre></div><p>This will print out the choice for your users, and then, when they type <code class="literal">ten</code>, the calculator will print out all of the numbers from 1 to 10. This screenshot shows how the code works:</p><div><img src="img/B04681_04_09.jpg" alt="Bonus – count_to_ten() function"/></div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec34"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you learned many new concepts. You learned about comparison operators, the symbols that allow us to compare two items. You also learned about <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">elif</code>, and <code class="literal">else</code>, which are three conditional words that let us tell our program how to make different decisions based on the information that a user enters. You learned about the <code class="literal">for</code> and <code class="literal">while</code> loops; both are very important in making programs that give feedback. You also learned a bit about how to use global variables, which can be shared with all the functions in a code file.</p><p>Hopefully, you are keeping up with everything we've talked about so far! It may feel a little overwhelming, but we will continue to review the concepts we learned in this chapter by building some new projects in the next chapter.</p></div></body></html>

- en: Django, a backend framework with frontend tools built in, is designed to help
    developers build apps quickly and easily. It is designed to take much of the hassle
    out of web development so that developers can focus more on the features they
    are building and not the problems they are facing. Loaded with dozens of tools
    and combined with countless third-party Python packages, Django provides many
    features and components that work right out of the box.

- en: The Django framework has been built with scalability and versatility in mind.
    As demand and traffic grow, so can your project. This allows developers to build
    onto an existing system easily. Security is also something that Django takes seriously
    by building many different security measures directly into its framework. This
    has been done to help developers avoid common mistakes when it comes to security.
    It even has its own user authentication system to help manage your users.

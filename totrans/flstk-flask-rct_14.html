<h1 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>Modular Architecture – Harnessing the Power of Blueprints</h1>
<p>In a far-off kingdom called Flaskland, there lived a brave prince named Modular. He was known for his love of clean and organized programming code, and his dream was to create a kingdom where all the snippet code lived in harmony. One day, as he was wandering through the land, he came across a castle in disarray. The code snippets were scattered everywhere, and there was no clear structure to be found.</p>
<p>The prince knew that this was a challenge he had to take on. He rallied his army of helper functions and organized them into modules, each with a specific purpose. He then declared that these modules were the building blocks of the kingdom, and with them, they could conquer the chaos.</p>
<p>And so, the prince and his army of helper functions set out to build a kingdom of well-structured, reusable code. They worked day and night until, finally, the newly organized kingdom was born. The snippets were organized, and the kingdom was a beauty to behold. This story captures the heart of code modularity, the practice of breaking down a program or system into smaller, self-contained modules or components. Blueprints in Flask encourage this modular approach to building web applications.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Modular architecture</strong> has become increasingly important as web applications have become more complex in size <a id="_idIndexMarker989"/>and scope. Modular architecture is a modular programming paradigm that emphasizes breaking down large applications into smaller, reusable modules that can be developed and tested independently.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">object-oriented programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">OOP</strong>) revolution of the 1980s also had a significant impact <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>on the development of modular architecture. OOP encouraged the creation of self-contained, reusable objects that could be combined to form complex applications. This approach was well suited to the development of modular applications and helped to drive the widespread adoption of modular architecture.</p>
<p>The principles of modularity, separation of concerns, and encapsulation remain key elements of modular architecture, and the pattern continues to evolve and adapt to meet the changing needs of software development. Today, modular architecture is a widely accepted and widely used software design pattern.</p>
<p>Modular architecture is used in a variety of contexts, from large-scale enterprise applications to small, single-page web applications. In Flask web applications, Blueprints refer to a way to <a id="_idIndexMarker991"/>organize a group of related views and other code into a single module. Blueprints resemble what components are to React: reusable pieces of UI that encapsulate a set of functions and states. But in the context of Flask, Flask allows you to organize your application into smaller, reusable components called Blueprints.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will explore modular architecture in web development. With Blueprints in perspective, we will discuss how Blueprints can help you to build decoupled, reusable, maintainable, and testable Flask web applications.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>Understanding the benefits of modular architecture in web development</h1>
<p>Modular architecture is a software <a id="_idIndexMarker992"/>development approach that involves breaking down a large, complex system into smaller, independent, and reusable modules. In the history of web development, modular architecture became more apparent. The traditional monolithic architecture involved having all the components of a web application tightly coupled, resulting in a large, unwieldy code base that was difficult to maintain and scale.</p>
<p>As web applications became more complex and the need for scalability increased, developers began to seek alternative approaches that would allow them to break down a web application into smaller, independent components.</p>
<p>Modular architecture emerged as a solution to these limitations, as it allowed developers to create smaller, reusable components that could be combined to form a complete web application. This approach provided several benefits, including improved maintainability, easier scalability, and better separation of concerns.</p>
<p>With modular architecture, developers could work on individual components in isolation, which reduced the risk of breaking the entire application and made it easier to test and deploy changes independently. As a result, modular architecture quickly gained popularity among web developers, and many modern web development frameworks such as Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, and Angular have embraced this architectural style. The popularity of modular architecture has continued to grow over the years, and it remains a crucial component of modern web development practices.</p>
<p>Let’s explore some of <a id="_idIndexMarker993"/>the benefits of modular architecture in web development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: In a traditional monolithic architecture, as an application grows, it becomes more difficult to manage, maintain, and scale. With modular architecture, each module is independent and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, which makes it easier to scale individual components as needed.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Reusability</strong>: Modular architecture encourages code reuse, which leads to a more efficient development process. Modules can be reused across different projects, reducing the amount of time and effort required to develop new applications. Furthermore, modular architecture makes it easier to update and maintain existing code, as changes can be made to a single module without affecting the rest of the application.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Maintainability</strong>: With modular architecture, the application is divided into smaller, manageable components, making it easier to identify and resolve issues. The modular design makes it easier to isolate problems and debug issues, reducing the time and effort required to resolve them. Furthermore, modular architecture makes it easier to test individual components, ensuring that the application remains reliable and maintainable over time.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Flexibility</strong>: Modular architecture allows developers to easily modify or extend the functionality of an application without affecting the rest of the system. This makes it easier to add new features, make changes, or integrate new technologies into the application. With modular architecture, developers can work on individual modules, ensuring that the application remains flexible and adaptable over time.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Improved collaboration</strong>: Modular architecture enables developers to work on different parts of an application in parallel, improving collaboration and reducing the time required to complete projects. The modular design allows teams to divide the work into smaller, manageable components, making it easier to coordinate and integrate their efforts.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Better performance</strong>: Modular architecture can improve the performance of web applications by reducing the size of individual components and improving the load times of <a id="_idIndexMarker994"/>an application. With smaller, more focused components, the application can load faster, improving the user experience. Additionally, modular architecture allows for better resource allocation, ensuring that the application uses resources efficiently and effectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, modular architecture is <a id="_idIndexMarker995"/>becoming increasingly important in web development, as it provides several benefits over traditional monolithic architecture. With its ability to improve scalability, reusability, maintainability, flexibility, collaboration, and performance, modular architecture provides a compelling reason for developers to adopt this approach in their projects.</p>
<p>By embracing modular architecture, developers can create better, more efficient applications that are <a id="_idIndexMarker996"/>easier to manage and maintain over time.</p>
<p>Next, we will discuss the big elephant in the Flask community – Blueprint. Blueprint is a powerful organizational tool that facilitates the structuring of a web application into modular and reusable components.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Understanding Flask Blueprints</h1>
<p>As you may be aware, Flask is a simple and lightweight framework that allows developers to create web applications <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>quickly and easily. Flask Blueprints are an important feature of Flask that help developers organize their applications into reusable components.</p>
<p>Flask Blueprints are a way to organize <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>your Flask application into smaller and reusable components. Essentially, Blueprints are a collection of routes, templates, and static files that can be registered and used in multiple Flask applications. Blueprints allow you to split your Flask application into smaller, modular components that can be easily maintained and scaled. This modular approach to building web applications makes it easier to manage the code base and collaborate with other developers.</p>
<p>Let’s glance through some of the <a id="_idIndexMarker999"/>benefits of using Blueprints in your Flask application development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Modular design</strong>: Flask Blueprints allow developers to break down their applications into smaller, reusable components. This makes it easier to maintain and scale the code base over time.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Reusability</strong>: Once you create a Blueprint, you can reuse it across different Flask applications. This saves you time and effort. Indeed, using Flask Blueprints can greatly simplify the process of building complex web applications, allowing developers to quickly and easily create reusable components with just a few clicks of the mouse.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Flexibility</strong>: Flask Blueprints can be customized to suit the needs of your application. You can define your own URL prefixes for a Blueprint, which allows you to customize your application’s URL structure. This gives you more control over how your web application is structured and accessed.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Template inheritance</strong>: Blueprints can inherit templates from the main application, which allows you to reuse templates across multiple Blueprints. This makes it easier to create consistent and well-designed web applications.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Namespaces</strong>: Blueprints can define their own view functions, and these functions are namespaced <a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/>within the Blueprint. This helps prevent naming conflicts between different parts of your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flask Blueprints undoubtedly promote a clear separation of concerns within your application code base. By organizing your code into separate Blueprints, you can ensure that each component <a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/>of your application is responsible for a specific area of functionality. This can make it easier to understand and debug your code, as well as ensure that your application is more maintainable over time.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will delve into setting up a Flask application with Blueprints in mind.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>Setting up a Flask application with Blueprints</h1>
<p>Blueprints in Flask are a way to organize and structure a Flask application into smaller, reusable <a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/>components. To use Blueprints in a Flask application, you typically define your Blueprint in a separate Python file where you <a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/>can define your routes, templates, and any other necessary logic specific to that Blueprint. Once defined, you can register the Blueprint with your Flask application, which allows you to use the Blueprint functionality within your main Flask application.</p>
<p>With Blueprints, you can easily separate concerns between different parts of your application, making it <a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/>easier to maintain <a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/>and update over time.</p>
<p>Now, let’s dive deep into the heart of how you can set up Flask applications with Blueprints.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>Structuring Blueprint Flask applications</h2>
<p>In web application development, efficient organization and modularity of the code base are essential for building <a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/>robust and maintainable projects. One of the key structural elements in Flask is the concept of Blueprints. These Blueprints provide a structured way to compartmentalize and encapsulate various components of a web application.</p>
<p>The approach invariably promotes clarity, reusability, and scalability. We are going to examine the<a id="_idTextAnchor292"/> structure of the <code>attendees</code> Blueprint – a crafted, organizational structure designed to streamline the development of attendee-related features within our web<a id="_idTextAnchor293"/> application.</p>
<p>The <code>attendees</code> Blueprint is nestled within the <code>bizza\backend\blueprints\attendees</code> directory. Create a new directory inside the <code>bizza/backend</code> project directory for the Flask applications and name it <code>blueprints</code>. The Blueprints added to the project make the directory structure appear as follows:</p>
<p><strong class="bold">The </strong><strong class="bold">attendees Blueprint</strong>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">bizza\backend\blueprints\attendees-models
-templates
-static
-attendee_blueprint.py</pre>
<p><strong class="bold">Detailed structure</strong>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">bizza\backend\blueprints\attendees-models
- __init__.py
- attendee.py
-templates
- attendees/
- base.html
- attendee_form.html
- attendee_list.html
- attendee_profile.html
- attendee_profile_edit.html
-static
- css/
- attendees.css
- js/
- attendees.js
attendee_blueprint.py</pre>
<p>The preceding <code>attendees</code> Blueprint contains the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>models</code>: This is a subdirectory containing a Python module named <code>attendee.py</code> that defines the data model for attendees. The <code>__init__.py</code> file is a blank Python module that indicates to Python that this directory should be treated as a package.</li>
<li><code>Templates</code>: This is a subdirectory containing HTML templates for the attendee views. The <code>base.html</code> template is a base template that other templates inherit<a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/> from. The <code>attendee_form.html</code> template is used for creating or editing attendee profiles. The <code>attendee_list.html</code> template is used to display a list of all attendees. The <code>attendee_profile.html</code> template is used to display a single attendee’s profile. The <code>attendee_profile_edit.html</code> template is used to edit an attendee’s profile.</li>
<li><code>static</code>: This is a subdirectory containing static files used by the templates. The <code>css</code> directory contains an <code>attendees.css</code> file used to style the HTML templates. The <code>js</code> directory contains an <code>attendees.js</code> file used for client-side scripting.</li>
<li><code>attendee_blueprint.py</code>: This is a Python module containing the Blueprint definition and the routing for the attendee views. This Blueprint defines routes for displaying a list of attendees, displaying an individual attendee’s profile, creating a <a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/>new attendee profile, and updating an existing attendee profile. The Blueprint also contains database-related functions for handling attendee data, such as adding new attendees and updating attendee information.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/>Defining models and Blueprint modules</h2>
<p>Models serve as the foundation <a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/>of a web application’s data structure. Models represent the essential entities and relationships within web applications. They encapsulate data <a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/>attributes, business logic, and interactions, providing a coherent representation of real-world concepts.</p>
<p>When defining models within a Blueprint module, you create a self-contained unit that encapsulates data-related logic. With the integration of models into Blueprint modules, you achieve a harmonious synergy, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/>benefits such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Clear separation</strong>: Blueprint modules isolate various functionalities, while models encapsulate data handling. This separation simplifies code base maintenance and enhances readability.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Coherent structure</strong>: Blueprint modules provide a logical context for models, making it easier to navigate and understand data-related operations.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Reusability</strong>: Models defined within a Blueprint can be reused across other parts of the application <a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/>through Blueprint integration, promoting a <strong class="bold">Don’t Repeat Yourself</strong> (<strong class="bold">DRY</strong>) coding approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s delve<a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/> into the attributes of the attendee model in a Blueprint <a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/>module:</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Attendees Blueprint</strong>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">-models- __init__.py
- attendee.py</pre>
<p>The <code>attendee.py</code> model is defined as the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">from bizza.backend.blueprints import dbclass Attendee(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True,
        nullable=False)
    registration_date = db.Column(db.DateTime,
        nullable=False)
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'&lt;Attendee {self.name}&gt;'</pre>
<p>The preceding <code>Attendee</code> model represents attendees at the conference. It has columns for <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>registration_date</code>. The <code>__repr__</code> method specifies how instances of the model should be represented as strings.</p>
<p>The attendee Blueprint is defined as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">from bizza.backend.blueprints.attendees.models.attendee import Attendeefrom bizza.backend.blueprints.attendees.forms import AttendeeForm, EditAttendeeForm
from bizza.backend.blueprints.attendees import db
attendee_bp = Blueprint('attendee', __name__, template_folder='templates', static_folder='static')
@attendee_bp.route('/attendees')
def attendees():
    attendees = Attendee.query.all()
    return render_template('attendees/attendee_list.html',
        attendees=attendees)
@attendee_bp.route('/attendee/add', methods=['GET',
    'POST'])
def add_attendee():
    form = AttendeeForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        attendee = Attendee(name=form.name.data,
                            email=form.email.data,
                            phone=form.phone.data,
            ...
        return redirect(url_for('attendee.attendees'))
    return render_template('attendees/attendee_form.html',
        form=form, action='Add')
...</pre>
<p>The preceding snippet defines a Flask Blueprint for managing attendees. It imports the necessary modules, including the <code>Attendee</code> model, <code>AttendeeForm</code>, and <code>EditAttendeeForm</code> from the <code>attendees</code> package, and <code>db</code> from the <code>bizza.backend.blueprints</code> package.</p>
<p>The Blueprint has a route for the attendee list that requires the user to be logged in. It retrieves all attendees from the database using the <code>Attendee.query.all()</code> method and renders the <code>attendee_list.html</code> template with the list of attendees.</p>
<p>The Blueprint also <a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/>has a route for adding attendees that is accessible via <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests. It creates an instance of <code>AttendeeForm</code>, and if the form is <a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/>validated, it creates a new attendee object with the data submitted through the form, adds it to the database, and commits the changes. If successful, it flashes a message and redirects to the attendee list page. If the form is not valid, it re-renders the <code>attendee_form.html</code> template with the form and the <em class="italic">Add</em> action.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Registering the Blueprints</h2>
<p>When you create a Blueprint, you define its routes, views, models, templates, and static files. Once you <a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/>have defined your Blueprint, you need to register it with your Flask application using the <code>register_blueprint</code> method. This method tells Flask to include the views, templates, and static files of the Blueprint in the application.</p>
<p>So, when the <code>app.register_blueprint</code> method is called, it adds the routes and views defined in the Blueprint to the application. This makes the functionality provided by the Blueprint available to the rest of the application.</p>
<p>Let’s use a basic Flask application factory function to create and configure a Flask application:</p>
<pre class="source-code">from flask import Flaskfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
# initialize the db object
db = SQLAlchemy()
def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # load the config
    app.config.from_object('config.Config')
    # initialize the db
    db.init_app(app)
    # import the blueprints
    from .blueprints.speaker_blueprint import speaker_bp
    from .blueprints.presentation_blueprint import
        presentation_bp
    from .blueprints.attendee_blueprint import attendee_bp
    # register the blueprints
    app.register_blueprint(speaker_bp)
    app.register_blueprint(presentation_bp)
    app.register_blueprint(attendee_bp)
    return app</pre>
<p>The preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/>code does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Imports the <code>Flask</code> and <code>SQLAlchemy</code> modules.</li>
<li>Creates an instance of the Flask application.</li>
<li>Loads the configuration from a configuration file.</li>
<li>Initializes the <code>SQLAlchemy</code> object with the application.</li>
<li>Imports the Blueprints from the different parts of the application.</li>
<li>Registers the Blueprints <a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/>with the Flask application.</li>
<li>Returns the Flask application object.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we will shift our focus to how Blueprints and the React frontend can be integrated seamlessly. We need to get creative and discover exciting ways to blend Blueprints with a React frontend and take our development to the next level.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>Handling the React frontend with Flask Blueprints</h1>
<p>In the case of a React frontend and Flask backend, Blueprints can be used to organize the different API <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/>routes and views that the frontend <a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/>needs to communicate with the backend. The frontend can make requests to the backend API endpoints that are defined in the Blueprints, and the backend can respond with the appropriate data.</p>
<p>Additionally, using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend provides a flexible and powerful development environment. Flask is a lightweight and <em class="italic">easy-to-use</em> web framework that is ideal <a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/>for building <strong class="bold">RESTful</strong> APIs, while React is a popular and powerful frontend library that allows for the creation of complex and dynamic user interfaces. With these <a id="_idIndexMarker1023"/>technologies, you can create high-performance, scalable web applications that are easy to maintain and update.</p>
<p>It’s time to unleash our imagination and explore the limitless potential of combining a Blueprint with a React frontend. Integrating a Flask backend with a React frontend involves setting up the communication between the two using API endpoints. We set up a typical Flask Blueprint, for instance, the <code>attendees</code> Blueprint structure, as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">bizza\backend\blueprints\attendees-models
-attendee_blueprint.py</pre>
<p>This route should serve as the entry point to the React app. Modify the existing Flask routes in <code>attendees_blueprint.py</code> to return JSON data instead of HTML.</p>
<p>In the React <a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/>frontend, we will create an <code>attendee</code> component <a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/>and make API calls to the Flask routes using a library such as <code>axios</code> to retrieve the JSON data and render it in the UI.</p>
<p>The updated <code>attendee_blueprint.py</code> file is as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">from flask import Blueprint, jsonify, requestfrom bizza.backend.blueprints.attendees.models.attendee import Attendee
from bizza.backend.blueprints.attendees.forms import AttendeeForm, EditAttendeeForm
from bizza.backend.blueprints.attendees import db
attendee_bp = Blueprint('attendee', __name__, url_prefix='/api/attendees')
@attendee_bp.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def get_attendees():
    attendees = Attendee.query.all()
    return jsonify([a.to_dict() for a in attendees])
@attendee_bp.route('/&lt;int:attendee_id&gt;',
    methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_attendee(attendee_id):
    attendee = Attendee.query.get_or_404(attendee_id)
    db.session.delete(attendee)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(success=True)</pre>
<p>The preceding code defines a Flask Blueprint for managing attendees in the application. The Blueprint is registered at the <code>/api/v1/attendees</code> URL prefix. It includes routes for getting all attendees, adding a new attendee, getting a specific attendee, updating an existing attendee, and deleting an attendee.</p>
<p>The <code>get_attendees()</code> function is decorated with <code>@attendee_bp.route('/', methods=['GET'])</code>, which means it will handle <code>GET</code> requests to the <code>/api/v1/attendees/</code> URL. It queries the database for all attendees, converts them into a dictionary using the <code>to_dict()</code> method defined in the <code>Attendee</code> model, and returns a JSON representation of the list of attendees.</p>
<p>The <code>add_attendee()</code> function is decorated with <code>@attendee_bp.route('/', methods=['POST'])</code>, which means it will handle <code>POST</code> requests to the <code>/api/v1/attendees/</code> URL. It first creates an <code>AttendeeForm</code> object from the <code>POST</code> request <a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/>data. If the form data is valid, a new <a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/>attendee is created using the form data and added to the database.</p>
<p>The new attendee is then converted into a dictionary using the <code>to_dict()</code> method and returned as a JSON response. If the form data is not valid, the errors are returned as a JSON response.</p>
<p>The <code>get_attendee()</code> function is decorated with <code>@attendee_bp.route('/&lt;int:attendee_id&gt;', methods=['GET'])</code>, which means it will handle <code>GET</code> requests to the <code>/api/v1/attendees/&lt;attendee_id&gt;</code> URL, where <code>attendee_id</code> is the ID of the specific attendee being requested. It queries the database for the attendee with the specified ID, converts it into a dictionary using the <code>to_dict()</code> method, and returns a JSON representation of the attendee.</p>
<p>The <code>update_attendee()</code> function is decorated with <code>@attendee_bp.route('/&lt;int:attendee_id&gt;', methods=['PUT'])</code>, which means it will handle <code>PUT</code> requests to the <code>/api/v1/attendees/&lt;attendee_id&gt;</code> URL. It first queries the database for the attendee with the specified ID. It then creates an <code>EditAttendeeForm</code> object from the <code>PUT</code> request data, using the current attendee object as the default value.</p>
<p>If the form data is valid, the attendee object is updated with the new data and saved to the database. The updated attendee object is then converted into a dictionary using the <code>to_dict()</code> method and returned as a JSON response. If the form data is not valid, the errors are returned as a JSON response.</p>
<p>The <code>delete_attendee()</code> function is decorated with <code>@attendee_bp.route('/&lt;int:attendee_id&gt;', methods=['DELETE'])</code>, which means it will handle <code>DELETE</code> requests to the <code>/api/v1/attendees/&lt;attendee_id&gt;</code> URL. It queries the database for the attendee with the <a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/>specified ID, deletes it from the <a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/>database, and returns a JSON response indicating success.</p>
<p>The utilization of Flask Blueprints to handle the integration of a React frontend with a Flask backend offers numerous benefits in terms of code organization, modularity, scalability, and maintainability. This structured development approach facilitates seamless full stack development while maintaining a clear separation of concerns.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Summary</h1>
<p>As we come to the end of this chapter, let’s take a moment to reflect on the exciting journey we’ve been on. The chapter explores modular architecture in web development and how Flask Blueprints can help build decoupled, reusable, maintainable, and testable Flask web applications.</p>
<p>The benefits of modularity, separation of concerns, and encapsulation remain key elements of modular architecture.

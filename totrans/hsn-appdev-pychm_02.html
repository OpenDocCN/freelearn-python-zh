<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Installing and Configuring PyCharm</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at the most popular features of PyCharm and considered not only what makes PyCharm a great IDE but also what makes any IDE historically great. There is a base set of features we as developers need in order to be truly productive. In this chapter, we’ll turn our focus toward installing PyCharm. You may be thinking that you simply download and install it. You can do that, but there are different ways to install PyCharm that you might like better. There are also different options based on your operating system.</p>
<p>Aside from the simple act of downloading the installer, running it, and mashing the next button until the installer’s dialog boxes go away, there are other considerations for getting the tool properly installed and working. PyCharm is highly customizable, and you are presented with some of those customization options as soon as the program runs for the first time. Some of these options are interesting, and some of them can be troublesome if you’re just picking every option and every customization during the process.</p>
<p>Here’s what you can look forward to in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading JetBrains Toolbox and using it to install and manage PyCharm. This is my recommended method of installation because you get an easy way to handle upgrades and uninstall. You can even install and manage several versions of PyCharm should you ever need to.</li>
<li>We’ll run PyCharm for the first time and go through the customization options the software presents on the first run. Naturally, you can change these at any time, and we’ll cover that too.</li>
<li>We’ll clone this book’s repository from GitHub using PyCharm’s integrated <strong class="bold">version control system</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>) tools.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>To be successful in this chapter, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer. Just in case you missed this particular gag in <a href="B19644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, I pride myself on being complete and leaving nothing to chance! The computer should meet the following system requirements for PyCharm:<ul><li>64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows 8 or higher, macOS 10.14 or higher, or Linux running GNOME or KDE desktop.</li><li>The official system requirements list 4 GB RAM as the minimum and 8 GB as recommended. If you intend to do non-trivial work, and you’re thinking about specs on a new computer, I wouldn’t buy less than 16 GB RAM, and I’d prefer 32 GB. The lighter specs are just those needed to run PyCharm. Most developers run more than the IDE.</li><li>2.5 GB hard disk space; SSD recommended. Again, that’s PyCharm’s low-end recommendation. If you’re shopping, get an NVMe drive rather than an SSD. The performance is usually 10x greater and the cost is easily affordable.</li><li>1,024 X 768 minimum screen resolution. That’s the low-end specification, and it’s a joke. You won’t get much done on a screen that size, and even cheap computers today can easily support 1,920 X 1,080. For professional work, you really want 4K if possible, or failing that two (or more) 1,920 X 1,080 monitors. The more screen real estate you have, the more productive you will be with any IDE. On a 4K monitor, I can have PyCharm showing me my project explorer, two open code windows side by side, the database explorer, and a terminal session.</li></ul></li>
<li>An operating system. This works best if it is installed on your computer already since we don’t cover how to do that in this book. Windows, macOS, Linux—it’s all the same as far as this book is concerned because PyCharm works in all three environments, and the UI is nearly identical in each environment.</li>
<li>A connection to the internet.</li>
<li>An installation of Python 3. We’re going to be using Python 3 exclusively in this book. There are a few different “flavors” of Python 3, but for the most part, the plain old Python 3 from <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a> will be fine. We’ll get into those “flavors” later when we start talking about virtual environments in <a href="B19644_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Customizing Interpreters and Virtual Environments</em>. If revision numbers give you comfort, the latest release at the time I’m writing is 3.11.1. The Python revision I’m using in that production SaaS app I mentioned in <a href="B19644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a> is 3.8. If your Python 3 installation is older than that, you should update it.</li>
<li>At some point, a <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> account might become handy since I will be sharing the code from the book using a <strong class="bold">Git</strong> repository. Since you’ll be cloning some code, but not pushing, it isn’t strictly necessary to sign in—that is, unless you’d like to sign in, view the book’s repository, and give it a star. That’d be peachy and prove to the world that you’re a stand-up human being.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Downloading PyCharm the traditional way</h1>
<p>First, I’m going to show the<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> simplest, most direct, and most common way to install PyCharm. There’s a decent chance you’ve already done this before you bought this book, and there’s nothing wrong with that. After we cover this, I’ll show you my preferred way to install using a free app from JetBrains called Toolbox. You can choose any of the installation methods you’d like, knowing the choice won’t affect the outcome of anything we do in this book.</p>
<p>Note there is a 30-day free trial available for the Professional edition if you’d like to try it out. After 30 days, you’ll have to pay for it or downgrade to the Community edition. Furthermore, don’t get too hung up on the version number displayed in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.1</em>. JetBrains releases updates to PyCharm quite often, and the number will probably change several times before this book even hits the shelves. It’s hard to go wrong with the latest version.</p>
<p>To download and install PyCharm, direct your browser to <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm</a>. The <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>site will detect your operating system and attempt to present you with the correct download option.</p>
<p>The download page has<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> three main parts, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.1</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can select the operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). If you want to use Linux, make sure you’re running GNOME or KDE as those are supported window managers.</li>
<li>You can choose between the Professional edition or the Community edition.</li>
<li>Regardless of the first two options, make sure you take a look at the dropdown for the installer. Windows and Linux let you select between Intel and ARM. macOS lets you select between Intel and Apple Silicon:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.1: The download window on the JetBrains website; make sure the correct operating system and processor are selected" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.01.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1: The download window on the JetBrains website; make sure the correct operating system and processor are selected</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded the proper version, follow the regular installation procedure for your operating system. If you selected a Linux version, you aren’t downloading an installer—you’re downloading a gzipped <code>.tar</code> file. You can just extract it and run PyCharm from the resulting folder.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>JetBrains Toolbox</h1>
<p>I just presented <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>the most common way people install software, including PyCharm, to their development computer. There is a different way, which I prefer, involving installing a separate product called JetBrains Toolbox. Toolbox is especially useful if you have multiple JetBrains products, as I do. I have a subscription to all their tools, and I regularly use many of them. My preferred C# IDE is JetBrains Rider, which I used exclusively in my book <em class="italic">Real-World Implementation of Design Patterns in C#</em>, available from Packt Publishing.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t use multiple JetBrains products, Toolbox provides some useful features such as providing an easy way to install, uninstall, and update your PyCharm installation. You<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> can even use it to install multiple versions of PyCharm should you ever need to, including <strong class="bold">Early Access Program</strong> (<strong class="bold">EAP</strong>) releases. EAP releases give you access to the most cutting-edge features from JetBrains before they are generally available. As a development lead, I like to take the newest IDEs for a test drive before I give the <em class="italic">all-clear</em> to my development team. Toolbox makes that very easy.</p>
<p>Toolbox is a separate download, and it is free. Let’s start by revisiting the PyCharm download page. At the bottom, you’ll find a link to JetBrains Toolbox, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.2</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.2: Skip the usual download links we covered earlier and instead click the link to Toolbox" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.02.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2: Skip the usual download links we covered earlier and instead click the link to Toolbox</p>
<p>It is entirely <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>possible that JetBrains will re-arrange its website. If there is no link at the bottom, you can simply search for <em class="italic">Toolbox</em> and find the most current download. You’ll land on a page like the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.3</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.3: The Toolbox download screen" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.03.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3: The Toolbox download screen</p>
<p>As with the<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> normal PyCharm download we reviewed earlier, this web page will detect the operating system you are using. The options are a bit simpler, but if you’re using a Mac, be sure to click the format button to select Intel versus Apple Silicon, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.3</em>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Installing Toolbox in Windows</h2>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>process for installing Toolbox is straightforward. It’s a <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>case where you run the installer and smash the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button until the dialog goes away.</p>
<p>Note that when Toolbox is running, you can find it in the system tray in Windows.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Installing Toolbox in macOS</h2>
<p>As with<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> all things Mac, the macOS install is very easy. Having<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> verified you downloaded the right version of the <code>.dmg</code> file (Intel versus Apple Silicon), find the downloaded <code>.dmg</code> file in the <code>Downloads</code> folder within your <code>home</code> folder. Double-click <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>to <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>open the <code>.dmg</code> file. Drag the Toolbox icon to the <code>Applications</code> folder. You’re done!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Installing PyCharm with Toolbox</h2>
<p>Regardless<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> of how you got here—be it on a Mac, Windows, or Linux—you should now have Toolbox running. At this point, the experience is <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>almost universal. On macOS, Toolbox is just a regular app like any other. On Windows, though, it runs in the system tray.</p>
<p>Running Toolbox for the first time brings a pretty standard <strong class="bold">end user license agreement</strong> (<strong class="bold">EULA</strong>). You<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> know the drill. Read it and make sure that JetBrains isn’t demanding the surrender of your firstborn, then make your selection to agree or disagree with the EULA. Naturally, if you disagree, our time together is at an end, unless you’re tuning in for the occasional dad joke. I’ll operate on the assumption you agreed to the EULA.</p>
<p>With Toolbox installed, you can install IDEs. You’ll see a screen like the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.4</em>, which lists all the available JetBrains products:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.4: JetBrains Toolbox running in the Windows system tray" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.04.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4: JetBrains Toolbox running in the Windows system tray</p>
<p>Naturally, we’re <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>only interested in PyCharm. <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.4</em> shows <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>PyCharm Professional and PyCharm Community in the list. If you’re interested in the PyCharm Educational edition, it’s further down on the list.</p>
<p>To install an IDE, click the <strong class="bold">Install</strong> button and wait while Toolbox downloads and installs the IDE. Once it is installed, the Toolbox menu changes slightly to show you which tools you have installed. You can see mine after I installed PyCharm Professional in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.5</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.5: The Toolbox ﻿app after installation of PyCharm Professional" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.05.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5: The Toolbox app after installation of PyCharm Professional</p>
<p>You’ll notice<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> Toolbox lists the applications you <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>have installed at the top of the list, while those available for install are below. The advantage offered by Toolbox versus a normal install is the ability to launch, update, and uninstall your IDEs as well as easily experiment with different versions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Launching PyCharm using Toolbox</h2>
<p>After<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> you’ve installed PyCharm, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> launch it or any installed IDE by simply clicking the entry in the menu. Before we leave Toolbox, let me show you some more interesting features.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Installing an alternate version or uninstalling</h2>
<p>Next to <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>each installed IDE in the list, you’ll see <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>three dots, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.6</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.6: The three dots next to each app represent a menu" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.06.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6: The three dots next to each app represent a menu</p>
<p>The dots are a menu. If you click them, you’ll see some options. You can access the settings for PyCharm. We’re going to do this later inside PyCharm itself, so we don’t need to do that now. There’s an option for viewing the latest news by clicking <strong class="bold">What’s new</strong>. Below that, there is an option for installing different versions of PyCharm aside from the latest. You can easily roll back to the last install if you have problems with the latest. Finally, below the divider and rendered in a very intimidating red font is the option to uninstall. It even has a terrifying and mysterious ellipsis following the menu option. Hovering over the option usually instills a sense of foreboding in all who try it. You were warned.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Updating PyCharm using Toolbox</h2>
<p>Toolbox<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> will help you stay up to date with the latest <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>version of PyCharm and any other IDEs you use. Toolbox itself has its own settings and its own update mechanism.</p>
<p>To get to these settings, click the hexagonal icon in the top-right corner of the Toolbox screen, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.7</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.7: Use the hexagonal icon at the top of ﻿Toolbox to access its update options" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.07.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7: Use the hexagonal icon at the top of Toolbox to access its update options</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Log in</strong> option allows you to connect Toolbox to your JetBrains account. The <strong class="bold">About</strong> and <strong class="bold">FAQ</strong> options show information about the product. The latter takes you to a website where the product's <strong class="bold">frequently asked questions</strong> (<strong class="bold">FAQ</strong>) is maintained. The <strong class="bold">Quit</strong> option will close the Toolbox program.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Launching and registering PyCharm</h1>
<p>Launching PyCharm, regardless <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>of how you do it, shows you a splash screen, then takes you to a set of typical first-launch screens. If you installed the Professional edition, the <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>first thing you’ll see is the registration screen shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.8</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.8: The licensing screen in PyCharm Professional appears on the first run" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.08.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8: The licensing screen in PyCharm Professional appears on the first run</p>
<p>The most common way to proceed here is to log in to your JetBrains account. Clicking the button labeled <strong class="bold">Log In to JetBrains Account…</strong> will launch your browser. You can log in or create an account. If you have purchased a license, logging in will associate your copy with the license you purchased.</p>
<p>If you work for a company that owns many licenses, you might need to log in to a JetBrains license server. There is also an option for registering with a registration code. You’ll find this code in your store account. This can be useful if you don’t have good internet access.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Do you have more than one computer?</p>
<p class="callout">Note that it is legal to install on multiple computers so long as you aren’t running two copies concurrently with the same license. The IDE will detect that and demand you shut one copy down.</p>
<p>If you don’t have<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> a<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> license and you aren’t ready to commit, you can select the <strong class="bold">Start trial</strong> option. You will still have to log in to a JetBrains account in order to activate your trial.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Setting up PyCharm</h1>
<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> you launch PyCharm for the first time, and you make it past the license and registration, the very next thing you see is a smallish window representing PyCharm without a loaded project. You can see the light color scheme version of this screen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.9</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.9: PyCharm with no loaded project" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.09.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9: PyCharm with no loaded project</p>
<p>From this window, there are a few obvious options. I call them <em class="italic">obvious</em> because they are right in the <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>middle of a big open space in the middle of the window. You can create a project, open an existing project, or clone a project from a VCS such as Git<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> or <strong class="bold">Subversion</strong> (<strong class="bold">SVN</strong>). However, my first stop is in the gray area to the left on the screen where you’ll find the <strong class="bold">Customize</strong> menu option. Let’s go ahead and review your options for customizing PyCharm to fit your working style. Clicking <strong class="bold">Customize</strong> brings you to the preferences screen, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.10</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.10: A small window for setting some of the important preferences in PyCharm" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.10.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.10: A small window for setting some of the important preferences in PyCharm</p>
<p>This screen allows us to change the most frequently accessed settings. We can change our color theme, the IDE font, and our keymap.</p>
<p>At the bottom, we can import our settings. This is useful when your boss finally springs for that new laptop, and you don’t want to spend a bunch of time re-customizing your IDE. As we all know, a well-configured, personalized IDE is like your old couch. Everybody who tries to sit on it will be horribly uncomfortable. Also, it smells. Your friends won’t tell you, but it does. To you, though, it’s molded itself perfectly to your form via <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>potentially years of sedentary satisfaction. That’s your IDE. You might take years tweaking it to perfection only to be faced with having to start over every time you get a new machine. Not today, friends. Not with PyCharm. We can export, import, and even share our settings and easily bring them into new installations.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">I like big fonts and I don’t know why!</p>
<p class="callout">You might be noting my font sizes are gigantic in all these shots. I am from Texas, and everything is bigger in Texas. However, in this case, I did that for you. Screenshots are easy to read with exaggerated font sizes, so you’ll see crazy settings in my preferences throughout this book.</p>
<p>You might be thinking at this point that PyCharm has a rather paltry set of customization options. You’d be wrong. This deceptively simple window is meant to ease you in by presenting the most changed settings. Many users stop here. But not you. No, not you. You’re a Viking! Other developers see a deceptively diminutive <strong class="bold">All settings…</strong> button at the bottom of the screen and think <em class="italic">There be dragons!</em> You see a rich opportunity for adventure! So, click the <strong class="bold">All settings…</strong> button, if you dare, and we’ll explore this brave new world together.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Appearance and behavior</h2>
<p>Clicking the <strong class="bold">All settings…</strong> button <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>brings you to the screen shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.11</em>. I will mercifully not attempt to cover every available setting as the list of possibilities is extensive to the point of tedium. The takeaway as you move through the customization settings is that you can pretty much customize every pixel generated by the running IDE:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.11: The Settings screen in PyCharm lets you change every aspect of the user experience within PyCharm" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.11.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11: The Settings screen in PyCharm lets you change every aspect of the user experience within PyCharm</p>
<p>Perhaps the most <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>useful way to start is to point out there is a search box at the top of the settings categories list. It is usually more practical to search for the setting you want than it is to troll through all the screens trying to find it.</p>
<p>Before we go further, I want you to notice the arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.11</em> points to two items on the screen: <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> at the top (which we’ll talk about in just a moment) and a <strong class="bold">New UI</strong> setting. As this book is being written, the user experience for PyCharm is undergoing a complete overhaul. As the application has grown, the menus and toolbars have become increasingly crowded. To fix this, JetBrains is working on a simpler UI layout that will hopefully make the tool easier to learn and adopt. The classic UI will likely remain available through 2024, but the new UI will become the standard in late 2023, which should coincide with this book going to press. Everything I’m showing you in this book will be with the <strong class="bold">New UI</strong> setting turned on. It may even be that this option isn’t even on the screen in later editions of PyCharm.</p>
<p>The first thing most developers want to do with a new IDE is to tweak the appearance. We’ve already found the<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> setting for the color theme and the font size, but there are other settings you’ll want to visit. Let’s start by clicking on <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong>, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.11</em>. This will open a menu on the left and display the appearance settings screen.</p>
<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>Having<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> opened the <strong class="bold">Appearance</strong> settings, you’ll see a window resembling the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.12</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.12: The Appearance settings for PyCharm" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.12.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.12: The Appearance settings for PyCharm</p>
<p>We have seen a few of these settings before. We can set the theme as we could in the simpler settings dialog we saw earlier. This window, however, gives you a link, labeled <strong class="bold">Get more themes</strong>, which will let you explore the JetBrains Marketplace for themes beyond the<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> standard issue you have with the PyCharm install. We’ll cover plugins toward the end of the book, but there’s no harm in looking around if you’d like to find something a bit more unique.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Wait for it!</p>
<p class="callout">This is not where you set the font that appears in the code editor. This setting controls the fonts on the UI itself. It will affect the buttons, menu items, window titles, and so on rather than the editor, which is probably what you are wanting to change.</p>
<p>Don’t worry—we’ll customize the editor font in just a moment.</p>
<h3>Editor settings</h3>
<p>As with <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>most of the sections within the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> window, there are a lot of customization options. I’m just going to hit a few highlights. As we go through the screens, you’ll see just how much customization is possible. If it’s a pixel on your screen rendered by PyCharm, you can likely customize it in some way! <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.13</em> shows the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> settings section of the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> window:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.13: The Editor settings in PyCharm’s Settings window" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.13.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.13: The Editor settings in PyCharm’s Settings window</p>
<p>Go through <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>the options on the left side if you like, and see whether there’s anything that makes sense for you to change. The <strong class="bold">Color Scheme</strong> section lets you customize the way the IDE colors your syntax. I’m going to jump to what I think is the most useful setting to modify. Click the <strong class="bold">Font</strong> section, as I have in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.14</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.14: The Font settings for the editor in PyCharm" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.14.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.14: The Font settings for the editor in PyCharm</p>
<p>This screen <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>does one thing: it controls the appearance of text in the IDE’s editor window. The other font settings we’ve seen have generally applied to the whole IDE. This setting is the most important one for us as users of the tool. This is the setting for the part of the tool you’ll be staring at all day long. You can set the font, the size, and the line height. I have my font size set high because I need nice, big fonts for all these screenshots, but to be honest, my daily driver on my work laptop is set to around 16 or 18. Bigger font sizes are easier to read depending on how far away your monitor is. Ideally, that shouldn’t be much further than arm’s length. If your font size is too small, you’ll unknowingly squint at your monitor more often, and this could lead to fatigue.</p>
<p>There is a setting here for enabling font ligatures. These are enhancements to standard fonts that allow symbols that we use in our code to show up with a bit more elegance. For example, with font ligatures enabled, a conditional with a not equals sign such as <code>if a != b</code> will be rendered as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.15</em>:</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.15: Turning on font ligatures allows you to express certain symbols that are not normally available, such as the inequality symbol on line 5</p>
<p>In order for this<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> to work, you have to select a font that supports ligatures. PyCharm ships with the <em class="italic">Fira Code</em> font specifically because it’s a nice IDE font that supports ligatures. If you want to explore more fonts with ligatures, point your browser to <a href="https://nerdfonts.com">https://nerdfonts.com</a>. It has many fonts appropriate for editors, terminals, and consoles, many of which support ligatures.</p>
<p>Below the <strong class="bold">Font</strong> settings in the <strong class="bold">Editor</strong> settings lies <strong class="bold">the color scheme</strong>. You’ve seen this one before, but it’s nice to know where it is since the last time we saw it, it was in the setup window.</p>
<p>If you’d like more customizations for the color scheme, twirl down the caret next to the <strong class="bold">Color Scheme</strong> menu item and you’ll see, as I do in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.16</em>, that there are many more options:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.16: You can change the color of just about anything in PyCharm using the options in the Color Scheme settings menu" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.16.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.16: You can change the color of just about anything in PyCharm using the options in the Color Scheme settings menu</p>
<p>You can control <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>the colors for every window in the application in every context they are used. For example, you can have different color schemes for SQL files versus JavaScript files versus Python files.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most useful setting in this lot is the ability to customize the font that appears in PyCharm’s integrated terminal window. You can see that in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.17</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.17: You can customize the font that appears in PyCharm’s integrated terminal window" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.17.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.17: You can customize the font that appears in PyCharm’s integrated terminal window</p>
<p>By default, the <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>console uses the same font as the editor. If you’d like to change that, you can. You can further customize the appearance of the console using the <strong class="bold">Console Colors</strong> settings, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.18</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.18: Console Colors settings in PyCharm" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.18.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.18: Console Colors settings in PyCharm</p>
<p>Personally, I <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>spend a lot of time in the terminal, so I appreciate the level of customization available.</p>
<p>Close the <strong class="bold">Color Scheme</strong> menu and let’s jump to the <strong class="bold">Code Style</strong> menu. You can see the menu in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.19</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.19: The Code Style menu within PyCharm’s Settings window" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.19.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.19: The Code Style menu within PyCharm’s Settings window</p>
<p>This one I find a <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>little puzzling. The <em class="italic">PEP 8</em> standard states no Python line should be longer than 79 characters, yet the editor has a hard wrap set to 120. Thankfully, we can fix this. As I said, <em class="italic">PEP 8</em> says code lines should be limited to 79 columns or fewer. The standard goes on to recommend comment lines and docstrings should be limited to 72 columns. To make sure I follow these rules, I change my <strong class="bold">Code Style</strong> settings, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.20</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.20: These are my recommended settings for wraps and guides, which honor PE﻿P 8" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.20.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.20: These are my recommended settings for wraps and guides, which honor PEP 8</p>
<p>I change<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> the <code>79</code>, and I check the wrap by typing in the checkbox. Then, I add <code>72</code> and <code>79</code> to the <strong class="bold">Visual guides</strong> setting so that I’ll see lines in the right-hand gutter. Well-written Python code is always consistent with standards. Setting these visual guides helps me avoid those annoying red squiggly lines. I hate those.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what I mean, Python has a built-in linter that will warn you when you break <em class="italic">PEP 8</em> rules. After a while, it’s kind of like an annoying mother-in-law sitting in the backseat while you drive. Setting up the <strong class="bold">Code Style</strong> settings this way avoids code rage in a way that is unavoidable with actual backseat drivers, and perhaps mothers-in-law in general.</p>
<p>Applying these settings changes the look of the editor, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.21</em>. We can see two lines on the right side showing our guides at 72 and 79 columns respectively:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.21: Code style has been applied and we can see our two faint gray lines on the right in the editor" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.21.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.21: Code style has been applied and we can see our two faint gray lines on the right in the editor</p>
<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>remember, we also turned on a hard wrap at <em class="italic">line 79</em>. To demonstrate this, you’ll note that <em class="italic">line 10</em> in the code, which was typed in before I changed the settings, clearly runs past our guide at 79 columns. To test the hard-wrap setting, I typed the line again immediately below <em class="italic">line 11</em>. Once I reached the hard-wrap limit, PyCharm inserted a line continuation (<code>\</code>) and dropped me to the next line down with an appropriate indent. It is now impossible for me to type a line of code that violates the <em class="italic">PEP </em><em class="italic">8</em> standard.</p>
<p>Note that changing the settings doesn’t automatically re-format your code. There is a utility that does that. We will learn how to automatically format and re-format code in <a href="B19644_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor077"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>.</p>
<h3>Other settings</h3>
<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>more settings visible in the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> window, including <strong class="bold">Remote Development</strong> and <strong class="bold">Plugins</strong>. These will be covered in later chapters.</p>
<h3>Exporting customized settings</h3>
<p>Customized settings<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> are amazing! But it’s always rough when you must switch to a new computer. You’d hate to have to redo all your customizations. Or maybe you want to share your settings with other developers on your team. PyCharm makes this easy. Just click the <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu and find the <strong class="bold">Manage IDE Settings</strong> option, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.22</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.22: PyCharm lets you export and import your settings" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.22.jpg"/>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Working with projects</h1>
<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>we have seen all the configuration options and we’ve tweaked some of the more popular settings, let’s take PyCharm for a quick spin around the block. We’ll create a quick Python project and learn how to run our main script within the UI.</p>
<p>At this point, you’re going to need to have installed Python 3 on your computer. The Python documentation <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html">https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html</a> explains the installation. I find this documentation to be complete, but you have to wade through a lot to get to the good part. To make this easier for beginners, I’ll include some additional links in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section at the end of this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Creating a new project</h2>
<p>You’re <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>probably starting to realize that PyCharm is a pretty powerful and flexible tool. There are several ways to configure it and several places in the application where you can start the configuration process. There is similar flexibility in creating projects.</p>
<p>If you’ve never created a project in PyCharm before, which is likely the case right now, you’ll see a window like the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.23</em>. This window offers a button to create a new project:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.23: The opening screen for PyCharm has a button that can be used to create a new project" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.23.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.23: The opening screen for PyCharm has a button that can be used to create a new project</p>
<p>If you have <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>created a project in PyCharm already, the PyCharm window will open with the last project it had loaded. This is the case I’m showing in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.24</em>. Here, I have the demo project I’ve had open for our examples so far. A little later in this chapter, I’ll show you how to clone this code using PyCharm’s integrated Git client, but let’s get back to creating a new project. In <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.24</em>, I already have a project open. In this case, you can use the <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu to create a new project. Click <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">New Project…</strong>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.24: You can use the File menu to create a new project by clicking File | New Project…" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.24.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.24: You can use the File menu to create a new project by clicking File | New Project…</p>
<p>Regardless of <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>which vector you choose, the result is the same. You get the <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> window shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.25</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.25: The New Project window in PyCharm Professional" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.25.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.25: The New Project window in PyCharm Professional</p>
<p>Here is where <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>you will notice a big difference between the Professional edition and the Community edition. In <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.26</em>, you’ll see the <strong class="bold">New Project</strong> windows for the Professional edition (left) and the Community edition (right). Focus your attention on the left side of the Professional edition window. The Professional edition offers a lot more project types, versus only one option in the free edition. The Community edition only creates pure Python projects. It doesn’t even give you an option, since that’s all it can do:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.26: The project creation options in PyCharm Professional (left) side by side with the Community edition (right)" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.26.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.26: The project creation options in PyCharm Professional (left) side by side with the Community edition (right)</p>
<p>It is important <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>to note that it is not impossible to create projects of any type in the PyCharm Community edition. For example, if I wanted to create a Flask project to make a web application, I absolutely can do that in the Community edition. However, I’ll have to do it manually from scratch. The Professional edition speeds things up with better tooling, but it doesn’t prevent you from doing anything you couldn’t do in any other editor, free or otherwise.</p>
<p>I’m going to choose a project common to both editions: a pure Python project. This is the default in both editions.</p>
<p>The first option at the top of the screen allows you to set the name and location of your project. I’m going to leave the default at <code>pythonProject</code>. Beneath that, there are a bunch of options for creating a Python virtual environment. This is the topic of <a href="B19644_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, so I’ll leave them as default for now.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">If you have not yet installed Python 3, or if PyCharm cannot detect your Python 3 installation, you may be prompted to install Python 3 automatically. Be advised that PyCharm might not install the latest version of Python 3, nor will it give you any control over where it is installed. It will also considerably slow down the time needed to create your first project.</p>
<p>Make sure the checkbox titled <strong class="bold">Create a main.py welcome script</strong> is checked, and click the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button. If <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>you had a project open already when you began the process of creating this new project, you’ll see a dialog asking what you’d like to do with the currently open project, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.27</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.27: If you had a project open already, you have options on what you’d like to do with it when creating a new project" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.27.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.27: If you had a project open already, you have options on what you’d like to do with it when creating a new project</p>
<p>For now, let’s select the <strong class="bold">This Window</strong> button, which will close the project you have open and replace it with your new project. Naturally, your old project is still intact and can be re-opened using the <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Open</strong> menu option.</p>
<p>The result is a new Python 3 project with a single file. The file will contain a variant of the ubiquitous <em class="italic">Hello World</em> idiom, which spares me from having to include it in the book’s source code. See? We all win! Let’s take a look at our new project within the IDE in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.28</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.28: The new project is created; now, let’s look around!" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.28.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.28: The new project is created; now, let’s look around!</p>
<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>can see, PyCharm created a project structure for us in the project explorer (<strong class="bold">1</strong>). The project explorer allows you to see and interact with all the files in your project. You can see that it created a few folders for the virtual environment. We’ll cover this in depth in <a href="B19644_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>.</p>
<p>The editor is clearly seen in the middle (<strong class="bold">2</strong>). We’ll be spending a lot of time here, so let’s point out that PyCharm, as with most IDEs and editors, uses a tabbed interface (<strong class="bold">3</strong>). There is a toolbar (<strong class="bold">4</strong>) to run, debug, test, and profile your program, which we will use in just a moment.</p>
<p>On the bottom right (<code>\t</code>) character in PyCharm unless you customize it that way. But why in the world would you go and do a thing like that?</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">If PyCharm is unresponsive, look down at the bottom of the window near <em class="italic">area 6</em>, and you’ll probably see a progress bar indicating that PyCharm is performing some operation such as project file indexing. You might have to wait until it finishes before your IDE is fully responsive.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Running a PyCharm project</h2>
<p>I kind of feel<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> like an annoying car salesman who won’t shut up about the features of the car. All you want to do is drive it already. Let me get you those keys and tell my non-existent manager that we have a fish on the hook. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p>In the case of PyCharm, the keys are toward the top of the window: <em class="italic">area 4</em> shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.28</em>. You can easily find it by locating the blue button with an arrow on it. I’ll show you exactly which button in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.29</em>. You’ll have to trust me on the color. It’s blue. This is the <strong class="bold">Run</strong> button. Click it:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.29: Click the ﻿blue arrow to run the main script" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.29.jpg"/>

<p>Now, let out a big old Texas YEEEE-HAW! Or, you can just do whatever passes for a hoot and holler wherever you’re from. You just ran your program. We’ve taken a big step toward mastering a new IDE. The IDE window changes, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.30</em>:</p>

<p>In addition <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>to the run window itself, note that there are buttons on the tab that allow you to rerun the program or stop a program that is currently running.</p>
<p>In the next section, you’ll learn how to clone a code project from GitHub. Before we do that, let’s close the current project. Locate the <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu and click <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Close Project</strong>, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.31</em>:</p>

<p>Excellent! You’re<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> ready for your next adventure! Let’s go get the sample source code for the book from GitHub.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Cloning this book’s code from GitHub</h1>
<p>PyCharm has a robust set of features for working with VCSs such as Git, SVN, Mercurial, and Perforce. We’re going to work with Git and<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> GitHub throughout this book because they have <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>become the de facto standard in the industry. If you use one of the other supported VCSs, the process is mostly the same. In fact, the user experience is mostly the same except for differences in how some of the VCSs operate. For example, Git uses a four-step process to commit and push files:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stage your local changes (<code>git add</code>).</li>
<li>Commit your changes locally (<code>git commit</code>).</li>
<li>Pull from GitHub or your central repository to make sure you have the latest changes and fix any conflicts (<code>git pull</code>).</li>
<li>Push your changes to the central repository (<code>git push</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast, SVN only has two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull the latest and fix any conflicts (<code>svn update</code>).</li>
<li>Commit your local changes to the central repository (<code>svn commit</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>My point is, the <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>different VCSs might have different workflows that change the user experience in PyCharm. For this book, we’ll only use Git.</p>
<p>Since you closed your project at the end of the last section, you should see a window similar to the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.32</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 2.32: Locate the Get from VCS button" src="img/B19644_Figure_2.32.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.32: Locate the Get from VCS button</p>
<p>We’re going to accomplish two things in this section. First, we’re going to set up your GitHub account in<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> PyCharm. This isn’t strictly a requirement should you not currently have an account, but sooner or later in your career, you’re going to need a GitHub account. You might as well rip off the proverbial band-aid. I won’t cover <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>how to create a GitHub account here. You can find instructions for this at <a href="https://github.com/signup">https://github.com/signup</a>.</p>
<p>Locate and click the <strong class="bold">Get from VCS</strong> button. You’ll see a screen like the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.33</em>:</p>

<p>Note that <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>on the right side of the window, you can see all your accounts for GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, and JetBrains Space. I’m going to go ahead and set up my GitHub account. Click the <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> item on the left menu. You’ll see a screen like the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.34</em>:</p>

<p>Locate and click the <strong class="bold">Login via GitHub</strong> button. Before you click it, I recommend you go ahead and log in to GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/login">https://github.com/login</a> using your favorite browser. This process is more seamless if you’ve already logged in and cleared any <strong class="bold">two-factor authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">2FA</strong>) hurdles.</p>
<p>Once authorized, you <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>can close your browser and return to PyCharm. After a few minutes, you’ll see all your GitHub repositories in the window. This makes working with your own repositories very easy. However, the repository we’re going to clone isn’t on your list, so we’ve got a little more work to do.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Cloning the book’s repository</h2>
<p>To clone <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>a repository you don’t own, head back to the <strong class="bold">Repository URL</strong> option on the left menu, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2</em><em class="italic">.35</em>:</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Summary</h1>
<p>This chapter was all about the preliminaries. We installed and configured your new instance of PyCharm on your computer. There are several ways you can install PyCharm. You can go the traditional route of just downloading the installer. My preferred way is to install the JetBrains Toolbox app and use that to install and manage PyCharm, along with any other JetBrains tools I might need or want. Using the Toolbox app allows us an easy way to update PyCharm or even perform a clean uninstall should the need arise.</p>
<p>We learned the differences between the three versions of PyCharm. The free Community edition is limited in the types of projects PyCharm supports with integrated tooling. When we created a new project, we were not afforded any project template options. Only “pure Python” projects are supported. This doesn’t mean we can’t create any kind of project; it simply means that the tedious part of setting up different kinds of projects isn’t handled for you by the IDE.</p>
<p>The Professional edition supports a broader set of tools, including a full set of project templates and expanded tools for web development and scientific workloads. While the Professional edition isn’t free, there are licensing options for individuals and a separate price for corporate developers. There also exist options to obtain a free professional license through an application process. Examples include Microsoft MVPs and other recognized professionals, open source developers, and university professors. There are often discount deals on JetBrains’ website for start-ups, educational institutions, and others. Unfortunately, book authors aren’t listed.</p>
<p>The third version of PyCharm is the Educational edition. This is a special edition that allows for the creation and playback of interactive lessons right in the IDE. If you teach Python using PyCharm, you probably don’t want this. You should rather use the Community or Professional edition and take advantage of JetBrains’ offer of free software for teachers.</p>
<p>Once we got PyCharm installed, we set out to configure the application. A number of important configuration options were highlighted. We can customize nearly every aspect of the way PyCharm works. Popular settings include setting the IDE’s color theme, font size, and code development settings. In our case, we set up our editor to use a font with ligatures called Fira Code, which ships with PyCharm. We also configured our <strong class="bold">Code Style</strong> settings to perform a hard wrap at 79 characters to keep us compliant with <em class="italic">PEP </em><em class="italic">8</em> standards.</p>
<p>After we got everything set up, we kicked the proverbial tires by creating a simple pure Python project and running it using the IDE’s <strong class="bold">Run</strong> button.</p>
<p>Finally, we set up PyCharm with our GitHub account and cloned this book’s sample code repository. We’ve got a lot done in a short amount of time. At this point, you’re all set to develop software using PyCharm, and we’re only in <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>!</p>
<p>Stick with me as we dive deeper into working with Python virtual environments in the next chapter. Virtual environments are considered a best practice, and they provide a way to segregate the requirements of your projects in your local development environment. As you’ll see, PyCharm negates the need to remember a half-dozen or so commands as well as the installation of extra libraries to get your project up and running more quickly.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Questions</h1>
<ol>
<li>What are the benefits of using the JetBrains Toolbox app to install and manage PyCharm installations?</li>
<li>What are the main differences between the Community edition and the Professional edition of PyCharm?</li>
<li>What are the main limitations of PyCharm Community?</li>
<li>If you are using the PyCharm Community edition, can you still develop projects using frameworks such as Flask that are seemingly only supported in the Professional edition?</li>
<li>What are the benefits of linking your GitHub account to PyCharm?</li>
<li>Have you gone to the book’s repository and given it a star yet? If you fork the repository, you’ll be notified if I ever change anything. I doubt that will happen since, like yours, my code is often perfect on the first try. Nope. Couldn’t keep a straight face. I tried.</li>

<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll</strong></span>: So why did you become a <a id="id346" class="indexterm"/>programmer?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wesley Chun</strong></span>: I've been fascinated by the ability to write code to solve problems for a long time now. My interest probably started during the latter years of high school.</p><p>My programming teacher showed us how to write code implementing Gauss-Jordan elimination and have a computer solve systems of equations automatically. This demonstrated how code could be used to automate tedious work that previously required inefficient human power to compute.</p><p>While we were only using Commodore BASIC, being able to implement that algorithm and watch it work successfully, was one of the factors that motivated me to become a professional developer. Wanting to make people and processes more efficient has led to my multi-decade career as a <a id="id347" class="indexterm"/>software engineer.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So how did you come across the<a id="id348" class="indexterm"/> Python programming language?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: Finding Python was not by choice. I had experience with C/C++ programming, as well as popular shell languages such as Tcl and Perl. Then I began working at a start-up company where Python became the primary development language. I learned Python and helped to build what was eventually to become Yahoo! Mail in the late 1990s.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How was Yahoo! Mail created?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: In 1997, I was working at a start-up<a id="id349" class="indexterm"/> called Four11. True to its name, the first product released by the company was one of the first online versions of the telephone white pages directories.</p><p>The Four11 service, while being a web app, was written entirely in C++, a monolithic binary that was burdensome to build and cumbersome to maintain. The CTO and co-founder began to look for a way to develop more nimbly.</p><p>After researching a variety of scripting languages, the CTO discovered that if you left all of the hardcore work as C++, Python was a language that you could drop in as the front-end, as well as replace the middleware with.</p><p>Our next product, RocketMail, was developed<a id="id350" class="indexterm"/> with this modified stack. We created our own web framework before that term even existed. Using this framework, our core team was able to launch a successful mail service, which caused Yahoo! to acquire our company. RocketMail became Yahoo! Mail and the rest is history.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So how did you end up <a id="id351" class="indexterm"/>becoming an author?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: Becoming an author was also accidental. During one of my summer internships at college, I was given the task of writing a user manual for customers.</p><p>I learned how to write using Ventura Publisher and with that experience under my belt, my coding and writing have been paired together ever since.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wesley Chun: 'When I was exposed to Python in the workforce, there were only two Python books on the market.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>When I was exposed to Python in the workforce, there were only two Python books on the market. One was a large case study book, while the other was the first Python book, which was already somewhat outdated. The need for a book about Python, for developers coming from languages like C and shell scripts, drove me to craft the first <span class="emphasis"><em>Core Python Programming</em></span> book.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What have you learned from <a id="id352" class="indexterm"/>writing Python books?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: If I wasn't already a developer, then I could probably say that I learned Python from writing books. Any time that you write a book, you need to do some research into the subject matter.</p><p>You should learn more information about your subject than is really necessary. In order to take a thorough look at a programming language, you must become familiar with both commonly-used features and corner cases.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>:  How have your readers impacted your writing?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: Having readers <a id="id353" class="indexterm"/>come up to me and let me know that I was one of their primary sources for learning Python, always brings a smile to my face.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wesley Chun: 'Readers come up to me and let me know that I was one of their primary sources for learning Python.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Whenever possible, I ask for direct feedback from my readers so that I can make my books even better. Readers love the exercises after a chapter, which help to reinforce what they learned. They also appreciate the wide variety of topics covered.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>:  Could you explain the idea behind CyberWeb Consulting?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: Yes, my home business is meant to consolidate all of the freelance work that I perform for the Python community. CyberWeb Consulting<a id="id354" class="indexterm"/> incorporates magazine articles, the technical Python training courses that I teach and other Python-related consulting opportunities that come my way.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What projects<a id="id355" class="indexterm"/> are you working on now?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: To this day, I still help people to discover how mundane and laborious tasks, which were once performed by humans, can now be automated. This frees people up to have higher pursuits.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

</p></blockquote></div><p>I'm currently a developer advocate at Google. I show developers how to integrate Google technologies into their apps, web or mobile. I started by advocating Google Cloud Platform products, but have since moved to the familiar G Suite productivity applications: Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, Sheets, etc.</p><p>While people are familiar with these well-known apps, I focus on teaching programmers about the developer platforms and <a id="id356" class="indexterm"/>APIs behind each of those tools. You'll often find me on the G Suite Developers blog or<a id="id357" class="indexterm"/> hosting the G Suite Developer Show (<a class="ulink" href="http://goo.gl/JpBQ40">http://goo.gl/JpBQ40</a>).</p><p>On the Python side of the house, I'm working on the third edition of <span class="emphasis"><em>Core Python Programming</em></span>, which was my first book. Readers familiar with <span class="emphasis"><em>Core Python Programming</em></span> will know that the book is being broken up into two volumes. The third part of the second half, <span class="emphasis"><em>Core Python Applications Programming</em></span>, was published back in 2012. Now I'm writing the third edition of the first half. This latest book will be called <span class="emphasis"><em>Core Python Language Fundamentals</em></span>, to better reflect its content.</p><p>I also have a Python blog, which I've honestly been neglecting. Fortunately for me, work has provided content for the blog because any of my work on Google developer products features a good deal of Python code.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What most excites you about <a id="id358" class="indexterm"/>Python at the moment?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: Believe it or not, I'm most excited that people even know what Python is today. Back in the old days, nobody had ever heard of Python before. Python was such a great tool, so we hoped that the world would one day find out about it. I think we're there now.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wesley Chun: 'Python was such a great tool, so we hoped that the world would one day find out about it. I think we're there now.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I'm also excited that we are near the end of the crossroads of having both Python 2 and 3. Python 3 adoption has taken off and most packages are now available.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What do you think about the long life<a id="id359" class="indexterm"/> of Python 2?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: Soon Python 2 will be in the rear-view mirror. Those who are skeptical of Python 3.x may remain that way, but that group is slowly disappearing. Python moving from 2 to 3 is not the same as moving from Perl 5 to 6.</p><p>The long life of Python 2 was necessary because of the backwards incompatibility of Python 3. However, Python 2.6 and 2.7 are great migration tools. They are the only 2.x versions that have 3.x features backported to them, to help with the overall migration.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wesley Chun: 'I proclaimed that it would take a decade for the world to move to Python 3, due to its lack of compatibility with Python 2.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I have been writing and speaking about the longevity of Python 2 for some time. Back in 2008, when 3.0 launched, I proclaimed that it would take a decade for the world to move to Python 3, due to its lack of <a id="id360" class="indexterm"/>compatibility with Python 2.</p><p>Based on the momentum that I'm seeing today, I think that I'm going to be more accurate in my prediction than I thought was possible. My original statement was mostly a flippant and abstract one, which has gradually become more concrete and realistic over the past few years. But Python 3.6 is a great version to move over to!</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wesley Chun: 'I think that I'm going to be more accurate in my prediction than I thought was possible.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Python is being increasingly <a id="id361" class="indexterm"/>used today for AI and machine learning. Why <a id="id362" class="indexterm"/>do you think this is?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: Python makes a great language, regardless of the field that it is applied to. Python does not require its users to be computer scientists in order to be able to solve problems. The language syntax does not get in the way for those who want a tool to build solutions with. Python is also great at encouraging group collaboration because of its understandable syntax.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So how do you think that Python could be made a better language for AI and machine learning?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: The continued development of existing Python libraries and the creation of new libraries would make working in the AI field even easier. That would help everyone.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: What changes would you like to see in <a id="id363" class="indexterm"/>future Python releases?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Chun</strong></span>: I'd love to see fewer Python releases and fewer new features. I think what the language has today (Python 3.6) is great.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Wesley Chun: 'I'd love to see fewer Python releases and fewer new features.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Sure, we need to have bug and security fixes. Additional performance improvements would also be welcome, along with the solving of the Global Interpreter Lock issue. However, I'd like to see the release schedules stretched out.</p><p>Eventually, I'd like to see development mostly stop with Python, so that it could be recognized as a standard like C or C++. If further improvements need to be made, then they can come as revisions to the<a id="id364" class="indexterm"/> standard. Being recognized as a standard will bring about Python's legitimacy and its greater adoption, especially in larger corporations.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Thank you, Wesley Chun.</p></div></body></html>

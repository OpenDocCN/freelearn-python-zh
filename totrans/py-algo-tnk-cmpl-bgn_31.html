<h3 id="toc_1">21.1 Introduction</h3>
<p class="my_basic">This chapter is dedicated to teaching you some useful tips and tricks that can help you write “better” code. You should always keep them in mind when you design your own algorithms, or even your own Python programs.</p>
<p class="my_basic">These tips and tricks can help you increase your code's readability and help make the code shorter or even faster. Of course there is no single perfect methodology because on one occasion the use of a specific tip or trick may help, but on another occasion the same tip or trick may have exactly the opposite result. Most of the time, code optimization is a matter of programming experience.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Smaller algorithms are not always the best solution to a given problem. In order to solve a specific problem, you might write a very short algorithm that unfortunately proves to consume a lot of CPU time. On the other hand, you may solve the same problem with another algorithm which, even though it seems longer, calculates the result much faster.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_2">21.2 Choosing a Decision Control Structure</h3>
<p class="my_basic">The following diagram can help you decide which decision control structure is a better choice for a given problem depending on the number of variables checked.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width44" src="img/chapter21-01.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>This diagram recommends the best option, not the only option. For example, when there are more than two cases for one variable, it is not wrong to use a nested decision control structure instead. The proposed multiple-alternative decision structure, though, is more convenient.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_3">21.3 Streamlining the Decision Control Structure</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Look carefully at the following flowchart fragment given in general form.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width34" src="img/chapter21-02.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see, two identical statements or blocks of statements exist at the beginning and two other identical statements or blocks of statements exist at the end of both paths of the dual-alternative decision structure. This means that, regardless of the result of Boolean_Expression, these statements are executed either way. Thus, you can simply move them outside and (respectively) right before and right after the dual-alternative decision structure, as shown in this equivalent structure.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width30" src="img/chapter21-03.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The same tip can be applied to any decision control structure, as long as an identical statement or block of statements exists in all paths.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>There are cases where this tip cannot be applied. For instance, you cannot move a statement (or block of statements) right before the decision control structure if this statement affects the Boolean expression of the structure.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Are you still confused? Next, you will find some exercises that can help you to understand better.</p>
<h4 id="toc_4">Exercise 21.3-1 “Shrinking” the Algorithm</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Redesign the following flowchart using fewer statements.</p>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width22" src="img/chapter21-04.png"/></p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see, the statement y ← a * 2 exists in both paths of the dual-alternative decision structure. This means that, regardless of the result of the Boolean expression, this statement is executed either way. Therefore, you can simply move the statement outside and right before the dual-alternative decision structure, as follows.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width21" src="img/chapter21-05.png"/></p>
<h4 id="toc_5">Exercise 21.3-2 “Shrinking” the Python Program</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Rewrite the following Python program using fewer statements.</p>
<div><p>a = int(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; 0:</p>
<p>y = a * 4</p>
<p>print(y)</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>y = a * 3</p>
<p>print(y)</p>
</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see, the statement print(y) exists in both paths of the dual-alternative decision structure. This means that, regardless of the result of the Boolean expression, this statement is executed either way. Therefore, you can simply move the statement outside and right after the dual-alternative decision structure, as shown here.</p>
<div><p>a = int(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; 0:</p>
<p>y = a * 4</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>y = a * 3</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(y)</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_6">Exercise 21.3-3 “Shrinking” the Algorithm</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Redesign the following flowchart using fewer statements and then write the corresponding Python program.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width32" src="img/chapter21-06.png"/></p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">If you try to move the Write y statement outside of the multiple-alternative decision structure, the resulting flowchart that follows is definitely not equivalent to the initial one.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width33" src="img/chapter21-07.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">This is because of the last path on the right side which, in the initial flowchart, didn't include the Write y statement.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Examine both flowcharts to see whether they produce the same result. For example, suppose a user enters a wrong number. In both flowcharts, the flow of execution goes to the Write "Wrong Number" statement. After that, the initial flowchart executes no other statements whereas, the second flowchart executes an extra Write y statement.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>You cannot move a statement or block of statements outside of a decision control structure if it does not exist in all paths.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">You may now wonder whether there is any other way to move the Write y statement outside of the multiple-alternative decision structure. The answer is “yes”, but you need to slightly rearrange the flowchart. You need to completely remove the last path on the right and use a brand new decision control structure in the beginning to check whether or not the user-provided number is wrong. One possible solution is shown here.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width34" src="img/chapter21-08.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">and the Python program is</p>
<div><p>a = float(input())</p>
<p>if a &gt;= 30:</p>
<p>print("Wrong Number")</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>if a &lt; 10:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>y = a * 2</p></blockquote></div>
<p>elif a &lt; 20:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>y = a / 2</p></blockquote></div>
<p>else:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>y = a + 2</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>print(y)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_7">21.4 Logical Operators – to Use, or not to Use: That is the Question!</h3>
<p class="my_basic">There are some cases in which you can use a logical operator instead of nested decision control structures, and this can lead to increased readability. Take a look at the following flowchart fragment given in general form.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width44" src="img/chapter21-09.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see, the statement or block of statements 1 is executed only when both Boolean expressions evaluate to True. The statement or block of statements 2 is executed in all other cases. Therefore, this flowchart fragment can be redesigned using the AND logical operator.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width35" src="img/chapter21-10.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's take a look at another flowchart fragment given in general form.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width38" src="img/chapter21-11.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">In this flowchart fragment, the statement or block of statements 2 is executed when either Boolean_Expression_1 evaluates to True or Boolean_Expression_2 evaluates to True. Therefore, you can redesign this flowchart fragment using the OR logical operator as shown here.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width35" src="img/chapter21-12.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Obviously, these methodologies can be adapted to be used on nested decision control structures as well.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_8">Exercise 21.4-1 Rewriting the Code</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Rewrite the following Python program using logical operators.</p>
<div><p>today = input()</p>
<p>name = input()</p>
<div></div>

</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The print("Happy Birthday!!!") statement is executed only when both Boolean expressions evaluate to True. The statement print("No match!") is executed in all other cases. Therefore, you can rewrite the Python program using the and logical operator.</p>
<div><p>today = input()</p>
<p>name = input()</p>

</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The y += 1 statement is executed when either variable a is greater than 10 or variable b is greater than 20. Therefore, you can rewrite the Python program using the or logical operator.</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">21.5 Merging Two or More Single-Alternative Decision Structures</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Sometimes, you may design an algorithm that contains two or more single-alternative decision structures in a row, each of which evaluates the same Boolean expression. An example is shown here.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width31" src="img/chapter21-13.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">When a situation like this occurs, you can just merge all single-alternative decision structures to a single one, as follows.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width24" src="img/chapter21-14.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>The single-alternative decision structures need to be adjacent to each other. If any statement exists between them, you can't merge them unless you are able to move this statement to somewhere else in your code.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_11">Exercise 21.5-1 Merging the Decision Control Structures</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">In the following Python program, merge the single-alternative decision structures.</p>
<div><p>a = int(input())</p>

<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; 0:</p>
<p>print("Hermes")</p>
</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The first and second decision control structures are evaluating exactly the same Boolean expressions, so they can simply be merged into a single one.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The Python program becomes</p>

<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; 0:</p>
<p>print("Hello")</p>
<p>print("Hermes")</p>

<h4 id="toc_12">Exercise 21.5-2 Merging the Decision Control Structures</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">In the following Python program, merge as many single-alternative decision structures as possible.</p>
<div><p>a = int(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>y = 0</p>

<p>if a &gt; 0:</p>
<p>print("Hallo Welt")</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(y)</p>
</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Upon closer examination, it's evident that the first and second decision control structures are evaluating exactly the same Boolean expression. Specifically, negating a &gt; 0 gives a &lt;= 0, and a second negation of a &lt;= 0 (using the not operator this time) yields not(a &lt;= 0). Thus, a &gt; 0 is in fact equivalent to not(a &lt;= 0).</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Two negations result in an affirmative.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">However, between the first and second decision control structures there is the statement b = int(input()), which prevents you from merging them into a single one. Fortunately, this statement can be moved to the beginning of the program since it doesn't really affect the rest of the flow of execution.</p>
<p class="my_basic">On the other hand, between the second and third decision control structures there is the statement a += 1, which also prevents you from merging; unfortunately, this statement cannot be moved anywhere else because it does affect the rest of the flow of execution (the second and third decision control structures are dependent upon this statement). Thus, the third decision control structure cannot be merged with the first and second ones!</p>
<p class="my_basic">The final Python program looks like this.</p>
<div><p>a = int(input())</p>
<p>b = int(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>y = 0</p>
<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; 0:</p>

<div></div>
<p>print(y)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_13">21.6 Replacing Two Single-Alternative Decision Structures with a Dual-Alternative One</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Take a look at the next example.</p>
<div><p>if x &gt; 40:</p>
<p>#Do something</p>
<div></div>
<p>if x &lt;= 40:</p>
<p>#Do something else</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The first decision control structure evaluates variable x to test if it is bigger than 40, and right after that, a second decision control structure evaluates the same variable again to test if it is less than or equal to 40!</p>
<p class="my_basic">This is a very common “mistake” that novice programmers make. They use two single-alternative decision structures even though one dual-alternative decision structure can accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The previous example can be rewritten using only one dual-alternative decision structure, as shown here.</p>
<div><p>if x &gt; 40:</p>
<p>#Do something</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>#Do something else</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Even though both examples are absolutely correct and work perfectly well, the second alternative is better. The CPU needs to evaluate only one Boolean expression, which results in faster execution time.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The two single-alternative decision structures must be adjacent to each other. If any statement exists between them, you can't “merge” them (that is, replace them with a dual-alternative decision structure) unless you can move this statement to somewhere else in your code.</p>

Therefore, the first and second decision control structures can be merged!</p>

<h3 id="toc_15">21.7 Put the Boolean Expressions Most Likely to be True First</h3>
<p class="my_basic">The multiple-alternative decision structure often needs to check several Boolean expressions before deciding which statement or block of statements to execute. In the next decision control structure,</p>
<div><p>if Boolean_Expression_1:</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements 1</p></div>
<p>elif Boolean_Expression_2:</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements 2</p></div>
<p>elif Boolean_Expression_3:</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements 3</p></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">the program first tests if Boolean_Expression_1 is True. If not, it tests if Boolean_Expression_2 is True, and if not, it tests Boolean_Expression_3. However, what if Boolean_Expression_1 is False most of the time and Boolean_Expression_3 is True most of the time? This means that time is wasted testing Boolean_Expression_1, which is usually False, before testing Boolean_Expression_3, which is usually True.</p>
<p class="my_basic">To make your programs more efficient, you can put the Boolean expressions that are most likely to be True at the beginning, and the Boolean expressions that are most likely to be False at the end, as follows.</p>
<div><p>if Boolean_Expression_3:</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements 3</p></div>

<p>3)Rewrite the following Python program using fewer statements.</p>
<div><p>a = float(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>if a &lt; 1:</p>
<p>y = 5 + a</p>
<p>print(y)</p>
<p>elif a &lt; 5:</p>
<p>y = 23 / a</p>
<p>print(y)</p>
<p>elif a &lt; 10:</p>
<p>y = 5 * a</p>
<p>print(y)</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print("Error!")</p>
</div>
<p>4)Rewrite the following Python program using logical operators.</p>
<div><p>day = int(input())</p>
<p>month = int(input())</p>
<p>name = input()</p>
<div></div>
<p>if day == 16:</p>
<p>if month == 2:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>if name == "Loukia":</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>print("Happy Birthday!!!")</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>else:</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>print("No match!")</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<p>else:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>print("No match!")</p></blockquote></div>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print("No match!")</p>
</div>
<p>5)A teacher asks her students to rewrite the following Python program without using logical operators.</p>
<div><p>a = float(input())</p>
<p>b = float(input())</p>
<p>c = float(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; 10 and c &lt; 2000:</p>
<p>d = (a + b + c) / 12</p>
<p>print("The result is:", d)</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print("Error!")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">One student wrote the following Python program:</p>
<div><p>a = float(input())</p>
<p>b = float(input())</p>
<p>c = float(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; 10:</p>
<p>if c &lt; 2000:</p>

</div>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">Determine if the program operates the same way for all possible paths as the one provided by the teacher. If not, try to modify it and make it work the same way.</p>
<p>6)Rewrite the following Python program using only single-alternative decision structures.</p>
<div><p>a = float(input())</p>
<p>b = float(input())</p>
<p>c = float(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; 10:</p>
<p>if b &lt; 2000:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>if c != 10:</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>d = (a + b + c) / 12</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>print("The result is:", d)</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print("Error!")</p>
</div>
<p>7)In the following Python program, replace the two single-alternative decision structures by one dual-alternative decision structure.</p>
<div><p>a = int(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>y = 3</p>
<p>if a &gt; 0:</p>
<p>y = y * a</p>
<p>b = int(input())</p>
<p>if not(a &lt;= 0):</p>
<p>print("Hello Zeus")</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(y, b)</p>
</div>
<p>8)Rewrite the following Python program, using only one dual-alternative decision structure.</p>
<div><p>a = float(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>y = 0</p>
<p>if a &gt; 0:</p>
<p>y = y + 7</p>
<p>b = float(input())</p>
<p>if not(a &gt; 0):</p>
<p>print("Hello Zeus")</p>
<p>if a &lt;= 0:</p>
<p>print(abs(a))</p>
<p>print(y)</p>
</div>
<p>9)According to research from 2013, the most popular operating system on tablet computers was iOS, with Android being in second place and Microsoft Windows in last place. In the following Python program, rearrange the Boolean expressions to make the program run more efficiently for most of the cases.</p>
<div><p>os = input("What is your tablet's OS? ")</p>
<div></div>
<p>if os == "Windows":</p>
<p>print("Microsoft")</p>
<p>elif os == "iOS":</p>
<p>print("Apple")</p>
<p>elif os == "Android":</p>
<p>print("Google")</p>

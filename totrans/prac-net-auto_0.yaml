- en: This book starts by providing an introduction to network automation, SDN, and
    various applications of network automation, which include integrating DevOps tools
    to automate the network efficiently. It then guides you through different network
    automation tasks and covers various data digging and reporting methodologies,
    such as IPv6 migration, DC relocations, and interface parsing, all the while retaining
    security and improving data center robustness. The book then moves on to the use
    of Python and the management of SSH keys for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication,
    all followed by practical use cases. It also covers the importance of Ansible
    for network automation, including best practices in automation, ways to test automated
    networks using different tools, and other important techniques.

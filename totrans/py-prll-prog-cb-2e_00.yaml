- en: The computing industry is characterized by the search for ever-increasing and
    efficient performance, from high-end applications in the sectors of networking,
    telecommunications, avionics, to low-power embedded systems in desktop computers,
    laptops, and video games. This development path has led to multicore systems,
    where two-, four-, and eight-core processors represent only the beginning of an
    upcoming expansion to an ever-increasing number of computing cores.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This expansion, however, creates a challenge, not only in the semiconductor
    industry but also in the development of applications that can be performed with
    parallel calculations.

- en: '**Parallel computing**, in fact, represents the simultaneous use of multiple
    computing resources to solve a processing problem, so that it can be executed
    on multiple CPUs, breaking a problem into discrete parts that can be processed
    simultaneously, where each is further divided into a series of instructions that
    can be executed serially on different CPUs.'

- en: 'Computing resources can include a single computer with multiple processors,
    an arbitrary number of computers connected via a network, or a combination of
    both approaches. Parallel computing has always been considered the extreme apex
    or future of computing, and up until a few years ago, it was motivated by numerical
    simulations of complex systems and situations concerning various sectors: weather
    and climate forecasts, chemical and nuclear reactions, human genome mapping, seismic
    and geological activity, the behavior of mechanical devices (from prostheses to
    space shuttles), electronic circuits, and manufacturing processes.'

- en: Today, however, ever more commercial applications are increasingly demanding
    the development of ever-faster computers to support the processing of large amounts
    of data in sophisticated ways. Applications for this include data mining and parallel
    databases, oil exploration, web search engines, and services networked business,
    computer-aided medical diagnoses, the management of multinational companies, advanced
    graphics and virtual reality (especially in the video game industry), multimedia
    and video network technologies, and collaborative work environments.

- en: Last but not least, parallel computing represents an attempt to maximize that
    infinite, but at the same time, increasingly precious and scarce resource of time. This
    is why parallel computing is shifting from the world of very expensive supercomputers,
    reserved for a select few, to more economic and solutions based on multiple processors,
    **Graphics Processing Units** (**GPUs**), or a few interconnected computers that
    can overcome the constraints of serial computing and the limits of single CPUs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To introduce the concepts of parallel programming, one of the most popular programming
    languages ​​has been adopted—**Python**. Python's popularity is partly due to
    its flexibility since it is a language used regularly by web and desktop developers,
    sysadmin and code developers, and more recently, by data scientists and machine
    learning engineers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From a technological point of view, in Python, there is no separate compilation
    phase (as happens in C, for example) that generates an executable file starting
    from the source. The fact that it is pseudo-interpreted makes Python a portable
    language. Once a source is written, it can be interpreted and executed on most
    of the platforms currently used, whether they are from Apple (macOS X) or PC (Microsoft
    Windows and GNU/Linux).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another strength of Python is its *ease of learning*. Anyone can learn to use
    it over a couple of days and write their first application. In this context, the
    open structure of the language plays a fundamental role, without redundant declarations
    and thus extremely similar to a spoken language. Finally, Python is free software:
    not only are the Python interpreter and the use of Python in our applications
    available for free, but Python can also be freely modified and thus redistributed
    according to the rules of a fully open source license.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Python Parallel Programming Cookbook, Second Edition*, contains a wide variety
    of examples that offer to the reader the opportunity to solve real problems. It
    examines the principles of software design for parallel architectures, insisting
    on the importance of clarity of the programs, and avoids the use of complex terminology
    in favor of clear and direct examples.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each topic is presented as part of a complete, working Python program, always
    followed by the output of the program in question. The modular organization of
    the various chapters provides a proven path along which to move from the simplest
    arguments to the most advanced, but it is also suitable for those who want to
    learn only a few specific issues.

    Parallel Computing and Python*, provides an overview of parallel programming architectures
    and programming models. The chapter introduces the Python programming language,
    discussing how the characteristics of the language, its ease of learning and use,
    its extensibility, and the richness of the available software libraries and applications
    all make Python a valuable tool for any application, and especially, of course,
    for parallel computing.'

    learn, through full programming examples, how to synchronize and manipulate threads
    to implement in their multithreading applications.'

    the reader through the process-based approach to parallelizing a program. A complete
    set of examples will show readers how to use the `multiprocessing` Python module.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](2f51ac2f-43a6-411a-86b4-4ca1362f9a41.xhtml), *Asynchronous Programming*, explains
    the asynchronous model for concurrent programming. In some ways, it is simpler
    than the threaded one because there is a single instruction stream, and tasks
    explicitly relinquish control instead of being suspended arbitrarily. The chapter
    shows readers how to use the `asyncyio` module to organize each task as a sequence
    of smaller steps that must be executed in an asynchronous manner.'

    the reader to distributed computing, which is the process of aggregating several
    computing units to collaboratively run a single computational task in a transparent
    and coherent way. In particular, the example applications provided in the chapter
    describe the use of the `socket` and Celery modules to manage distributed tasks.'

    programming language.  The **PythonAnywhere** platform is very useful for deploying
    Python applications on the cloud, and will be examined in this chapter. This chapter
    also contains example applications demonstrating the use of **containers** and

    at the modern GPUs that are providing breakthrough performance for numerical computing
    at the cost of increased programming complexity. In fact, the programming models
    for GPUs require that the coder manually manage the data transfer between the
    CPU and GPU.  This chapter will teach the reader, using programming examples and
    use cases, how to exploit the computing power provided by GPU cards using the
    powerful Python modules of **PyCUDA**, **Numba**, and **PyOpenCL**.'

    engineering: debugging and testing. In particular, the following Python frameworks
    will be described: `winpdb-reborn` for debugging, and `unittest` and `nose` for

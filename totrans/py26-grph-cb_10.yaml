    user interfaces of the graphical kind. These are known as **GUI** or **Graphic
    User Interface**. The commonly-used term for GUI components is **Widget**. The
    word Widget has no particular meaning other than "general sort of gadget". If
    you used the example from [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Animation Principles"),
    *Animation Principles* on a color-mixing palette, then you would have used the
    slider or scale widget which will be explained in this chapter. We will also demonstrate
    that it is not too difficult to create our own widgets.

    When there are a group of widgets inside a window, only one widget can react to
    an event like the click of the mouse button. In this example, the button underneath
    the mouse cursor has focus and therefore is the one that will respond to a click
    of the mouse. As the cursor moves over another button, then *that button has focus*.
    In this example, the button that has focus changes its color, on a Linux-operating
    system. On MS Windows, the buttons do not change color but the mouse cursor changes.

    only one of them can be given attention or listened to at a time. Each button
    is programmed to respond to the click of a mouse but when the mouse is clicked,
    only one button should respond. The widget responding is the one that the program
    focuses on. In our example, you actually see the focus being given to the button
    when the mouse pointer moves across it the focus is used to change the button's
    coloring in a Linux operating system. It is like the chairman offering the floor
    to someone wanting to address a meeting group. The aspirant talker can only do
    so when the chairman offers them the floor (gives them focus). When this happens,
    everyone else is expected to be quiet and listen courteously.

- en: The drop-down menu has its own button. The `callback()` function that gets called
    when this button is clicked is named `grab_and_assign` in this particular recipe
    and one of the instructions in this event service routine is to assign the value
    of the menu item selected to the variable `chosen_option`. The instruction that
    does this is `chosen_option = var.get()`.

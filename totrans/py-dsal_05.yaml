- en: Queues are used to implement a variety of functionalities in computer land.
    For instance, instead of providing each computer on a network with its own printer,
    a network of computers can be made to share one printer by queuing what each printer
    wants to print. When the printer is ready to print, it will pick one of the items
    (usually called jobs) in the queue to print out.

    Upon hitting the play button, all the songs in the main playlist are played one
    after the other. The sequential playing of the songs can be implemented with queues
    because the first song to be queued is the first song that is played. This aligns
    with the FIFO acronym. We shall implement our own playlist queue that plays songs
    in the FIFO manner.

    and a way to play all the tracks in the queue. In a full-blown music player, threads
    would be used to improve how the queue is interacted with, while the music player
    continues to be used to select the next song to be played, paused, or even stopped.

    the song. The length is a random number between 5 and 10\. The random module provides
    the `randint` method to enable us generate the random numbers. The class represents
    any MP3 track or file that contains music. The random length of a track is used
    to simulate the number of seconds it takes to play a song or track.

    data structures, namely stacks and queues. We have seen how these data structures
    closely mimic stacks and queues in the real world. Concrete implementations, together
    with their varying types, have been shown. We later applied the concept of stacks
    and queues to write real-life programs.

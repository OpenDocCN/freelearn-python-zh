<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Introduction to PyCharm – the Most Popular IDE for Python</h1>
<p>Welcome to the second edition of <em class="italic">Hands-On Application Development with PyCharm</em>! Most programmers have the objective to build robust, high-quality software that can stand the test of time. The most important step to reach this goal is choosing the correct language. With so many languages out there, which is the best one to choose? A stellar programmer will take many things about the language into consideration. One of the most important aspects of the programming language to consider is the support tools that are necessary for the development stages. The <strong class="bold">Python</strong> programming language<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> is rumored to enable great productivity compared to many other languages. Python’s famous <em class="italic">batteries included</em> philosophy embodies this idea by bundling a powerful standard library, a code editor, and a debugger. Everything is built into the language’s normal installer, which is available from <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a>. There’s <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>just one small problem, at least for me – Microsoft.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking. You’ve just mentally prepared yourself for a protracted rant from one of those <strong class="bold">Unix</strong>/<strong class="bold">Linux</strong> guys complaining about the big, bad evil that is Microsoft. I’m not going to do that because I’m not sure I’m a Linux guy. I mean, I do have an awful lot of cargo pants in my closet. I can’t help it. They’re just so roomy and you can carry all of your stuff without dragging a bag around with you. I’ll also admit to having a great many T-shirts with emblems, logos, or statements that maybe only 5% of the people I encounter will understand. These T-shirts are very funny, but the only grins I get are from my colleagues. The more I think about it, I’m not a Linux guy. To me, Linux is a tool. Sometimes, it’s the right one, but sometimes, it isn’t. Since I’m not a Linux fanboy, that can’t be the reason for my statement that Microsoft is the problem. The real reason is quite the opposite. About 30 or so years ago, Microsoft did something massively right. They created the first really good <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>commercially available <strong class="bold">integrated development </strong><strong class="bold">environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>).</p>
<p>In truth, it may have been more than 30 years ago, and there may have been others before it. However, many “senior developers” in the software business today got their start with a Microsoft product <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>called <strong class="bold">Visual Basic</strong> (<strong class="bold">VB</strong>). OK; this is the part where the language snobs sneer and hold their noses as though they were just presented with a plate of Brussels sprouts, or maybe a dirty diaper, but let’s reel it back in. 30 years ago, most people rocking home computers only had a handful of options. <strong class="bold">Beginners All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code</strong> (<strong class="bold">BASIC</strong>) shipped with just about every computer made from 1978<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> forward. It was an age when <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>not even Apple had a <strong class="bold">graphical user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUI</strong>) on their <strong class="bold">operating system</strong> (<strong class="bold">OS</strong>). That didn’t happen until 1983 when Apple released Lisa. We had mice, and we could create programs capable of working with pointing devices, but the OS didn’t have a windowing system. They didn’t need a windowing system because back then, computers could only run one program at a time.</p>
<p>Writing desktop <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>software for computers that lacked OS-level support for Windows was hard. There were no <strong class="bold">software development kits</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDKs</strong>) or <strong class="bold">application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>) to handle any of the heavy lifting. Writing <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>software was mostly an exercise in tedium. You had to write hundreds of lines of box-drawing boilerplate code in a tool that was barely better than Notepad. Then, one day in 1991, the year I graduated from the University of Oklahoma, it all changed.</p>
<p>Microsoft released a version of <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>BASIC that included the ability to create <strong class="bold">desktop GUIs</strong> right there in the development <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>environment. They called it <em class="italic">Visual Basic</em>. The first versions ran in <strong class="bold">Microsoft’s Disk Operating System</strong> (<strong class="bold">MS-DOS</strong>), but later, we<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> got support for Windows, Windows 2, and then Windows 3.1. Windows 3.1 was significant because that’s when we got true multitasking if our PC was equipped with an 80386 processor. PCs were no longer limited to running one program at a time, and the Windows OS made mouse-driven interaction ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Things got interesting with VB. Instead of coding an interface, you drew the interface. The IDE included a palette of components and a window. You could draw buttons, text boxes, and anything else you needed, directly onto the window. After you drew them, you would then “wire them together” with event handlers. What you drew was what showed up when you ran the program. The VB <strong class="bold">user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">UI</strong>) was ultimately carried over into Microsoft’s <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>Visual Studio. Even today, Visual Studio 2022 continues with the same features that were so groundbreaking in 1991. <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.1</em> shows the toolkit used to draw visual UIs for Windows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.1: The Visual Studio IDE originated as a product called Visual Basic in 1991. It defined the standards for what a good IDE should be" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.01.jpg"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1: The Visual Studio IDE originated as a product called Visual Basic in 1991. It defined the standards for what a good IDE should be</p>
<p>The VB3 IDE<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> that began my career introduced even more ground-breaking features that my smug, cargo-pants-wearing Unix colleagues could only dream of. They were still fighting over vi’s superiority over Emacs, or vice versa, depending on whom you asked. Meanwhile, VB3 had colored syntax highlighting, support for editing multiple files, a graphical interface editor for drawing buttons and other screen widgets, and a visual programming tool that tied code, events, and GUI elements together. It had a debugging system you could use by simply clicking a line number. Doing so would create a red dot – a breakpoint in the code where the execution would stop during a test run, allowing the developer to inspect the state of the running program. It was pure coder nerd-vana! Love them or hate them, Microsoft’s VB IDEs defined what IDEs are supposed to be today. Nobody who has learned to code using a Microsoft IDE, whether it be a legacy language or a modern one, is willing to accept anything less than that experience.</p>
<p>With every language that I’ve learned since, the first thing I always do is find the very best IDE available that offers those features I can’t live without. When I started working with Python 3 about six years ago, I found <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>PyCharm. I used it to perform a full re-write on a complex <strong class="bold">software-as-a-service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) product, which took me about 18 months to complete. It was trial by fire. In this book, I intend to share what I learned, complete with scorch marks.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, we will be learning about the general interface of the PyCharm IDE, along with customizations and extensions to help you adapt your tools to the kind of work you’ll be doing with Python. This first chapter discusses the merits of IDEs in general. I’ll provide a comparison of the most common tools used for Python development. Some of them are very good while others, despite being widely used, are fairly primitive.</p>
<p>We’ll cover the following main topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of PyCharm as a Python IDE and some notable details on its developing company, JetBrains</li>
<li>The usage of PyCharm within the community and a breakdown of which professions tend to utilize PyCharm the most</li>
<li>A comprehensive outline regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using PyCharm, in comparison to other Python editors/IDEs</li>
<li>The differences between the Professional and Community editions of PyCharm and the additional functionalities that the paid edition offers</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, if you have already decided that PyCharm is the Python IDE for you, feel free to jump to <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Installing and Configuring PyCharm</em>, to go through the installation and registration process. If you have already downloaded and successfully set up PyCharm on your system, you might want to begin at the second section of this book, starting from <a href="B19644_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Customizing Interpreters and </em><em class="italic">Virtual Environments</em>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>This chapter is introductory, so we won’t be coding yet and the technical requirements are nil. It’s <a href="B19644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a> and I know you’re all fired up and ready to go and nil is boring. So, let’s get moving!</p>
<p>First, here is what you will need to be successful with this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer. I know! It’s obvious, but I pride myself on being complete and leaving nothing to chance!</li>
<li>An OS. This works best if it is installed on your computer already since we won’t cover how to do that in this book. Windows, macOS, Linux – it’s all the same as far as this book is concerned because PyCharm works in all three, and the UI is nearly identical in each environment.</li>
<li>An installation of Python. We’re going to be using Python 3 exclusively in this book. There are a few different “flavors” of Python 3 but for the most part, the plain old Python 3 from <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a> will be fine. We’ll get into those “flavors” later when we start talking about virtual environments in <a href="B19644_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor052"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Customizing Interpreters and Virtual Environments</em>. If revision numbers give you comfort, the latest release at the time I’m writing this book is 3.11.1. The Python revision I’m using in that production SaaS app I mentioned earlier is 3.8. If your Python 3 installation is older than that, you should update it.</li>
<li>At some point, a <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> account might come in handy since I will be sharing the code from the book using a <strong class="bold">Git</strong> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>The continued success of Python</h1>
<p>In the first edition of this<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> book, the author titled this section <em class="italic">The recent rise of Python</em>. Time has passed and I’m picking up where he left off. I think it’s important to point out that the <em class="italic">recent</em> rise has more or less continued since the first edition of this book was published. Python has continued to be one of the most popular and widely adopted languages for some very good reasons. One of those reasons is that Python stresses readability and uses a simple syntax. This allows newcomers to the language, and indeed to the field of software development, a quick path to success. Contrast that with the previously normal experience of forcing college and university students to learn C or C++ as their first language. These languages are terse and complicated and generally have a poor track record when it comes to developer productivity. Sure, C<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> and C++ are powerful<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> languages and can produce the most performant software available. However, in my experience, a language that can take you from “Hello World” to being able to produce useful software in a short period trumps the performance gains in all but the most extreme cases. <strong class="bold">Guido van Rossum</strong>, the creator of Python, compares the quickness of Python to other languages in his paper <em class="italic">OMG-DARPA-MCC Workshop on Compositional Software Architecture</em>. In the paper, van Rossum states that development in Python is estimated to be 3-5 times faster than that in Java, and 5-10 times faster than that in C/C++. Keeping this difference in mind, we can easily understand why<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> Python is being so widely adopted. After all, time is money. You can find Guido van Rossum’s complete essay here: <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/omg-darpa-mcc-position/">http://www.python.org/doc/essays/omg-darpa-mcc-position/</a>.</p>
<p>The comparison between Python and Java or C/C++ is a weak one since these languages are designed and used for different applications. C and C++ are used when very high performance is required. Most OSs are written in C++, as are real-time systems such as those you’d find in a Tesla automobile or modern spacecraft. It isn’t necessarily fair to compare specific productivity between Python and C++ because they aren’t used to make the same types of applications.</p>
<p>Java, on the other hand, is used to<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> develop the same types of applications for which you might use Python: enterprise and web applications. Java, though, requires a lot of boilerplate. This means a developer has to create a lot of code and structures just to support the application’s existence before they can even think about writing code for the application itself. This boilerplate is largely absent from Python. Furthermore, Java relies on a very rigid, static object-oriented paradigm. Python, in contrast, is far more flexible, offering a dynamic programming model. Even though the two languages are used to make the same type of application, Python gives you some serious shortcuts, owing to its more flexible paradigm.</p>
<p>These factors that comprise Python’s strengths, along with many others, have coalesced to form a very accessible development language supported by a community of raving fans. That community is still growing by introducing coding to a gamut of fields and professions distinct from those of us who historically focus solely on traditional application development. At the time of writing, the <strong class="bold">TIOBE Index</strong>, a <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>ranking system for the popularity of programming languages, ranks Python as the number one language, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.2</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.2: TIOBE rankings show Python to be the most popular language" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.02.jpg"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2: TIOBE rankings show Python to be the most popular language</p>
<p>Python<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> has a huge standard library that provides anything you might need to build any kind of software you can imagine. If that statement proves false for your specific project, there is a vast third-party and largely open source ecosystem consisting of hundreds of thousands of libraries upon which you can build. You can find a catalog of these libraries<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> at <a href="https://pypi.org">https://pypi.org</a>. Taking all this together, a new software developer can go from idea and zero Python experience to a production application very quickly. This process can be greatly accelerated by a good IDE.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>The philosophy of IDEs</h1>
<p>Back when I was your age, things <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>were different. That is, of course, unless we are the same age, in which case everything was the same. We didn’t have the internet. When we wanted to learn new coding languages and techniques or understand the history of our craft, we were required to take a sacred pilgrimage. One year, I smuggled in a Polaroid. You can see the pictures I took in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.3</em>. You should understand that all of what I am about to tell you is both true and a closely guarded industry secret. Just so we’re clear, you didn’t hear this from me.</p>
<p>Hidden somewhere in a mystic range of mountains, seekers of great coding wisdom would ascend the 10,000 stairs by the light of the full moon in search of the Master. The journey was not easy, and the wisdom imparted had to be hard-earned. It was on one such crusade that I learned why good<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> IDEs are so important. The Master said, “If you know the language, and you know the IDE, you need not fear the result of a hundred deployments.”</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.3: High in the sacred mountains, up the 10,000 stairs﻿,﻿ lies the monastery where I learned to code" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.03.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3: High in the sacred mountains, up the 10,000 stairs, lies the monastery where I learned to code</p>
<p>The Master often speaks in riddles, so let me explain. <em class="italic">Deployment</em> refers<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> to a published iteration or an <strong class="bold">increment</strong> of your software. In most professional circumstances, the objective is to publish your software. If our objective is to publish, the next sticking point is that we must know a programming language. I assume you have at least a tacit understanding of programming in Python. That just leaves the Master’s reference to the<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> IDE.</p>
<p>There are several classes of tools a developer might use to develop Python code. The Python<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> language can be considered an interpreted language. We could argue that when it runs, some of the code is optimized into C code and cached, but at this stage, we aren’t worried about that level of detail. The point is that a Python program exists as simple plain text files and can be executed in that form. Contrast this with statically compiled languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, or Go. Those and many other languages require the code in the text files to undergo a compilation phase where a new executable file is produced. In C#, you can’t simply execute a <code>.cs</code> file. You need to compile it into a binary, then<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> execute the binary. Since Python executes its code directly via the Python interpreter, the level of tooling needed to work on Python can be very simple. Essentially, any text editor will do. There are three levels of editor capability to choose from.</p>
<p>The first is a simple text editor. Simple text editors <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>are generally limited to opening, editing, and saving text. They are generic tools designed to work with any kind of text file, from <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>grocery lists to <code>systemd</code> configurations. In Windows, you might know it as <em class="italic">Notepad</em>. On a Mac, you might use <em class="italic">TextPad</em>, and if <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>you are rocking a Linux desktop such<a id="_idIndexMarker031"/> as <code>systemd</code> configuration is, don’t sweat it; it’s a system administration file on Linux. I just needed something that sounded complicated to characterize the more complex end of the text file gamut.</p>
<p>The second evolution of programming editors<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> is <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>called <em class="italic">enhanced editors</em>. These editors are purposefully designed to work with technical files. Some popular <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>examples include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>Atom</li>
<li>Notepad++</li>
<li>UltraEdit</li>
<li>Sublime Text</li>
<li>JetBrains Fleet</li>
<li>Bluefish Editor</li>
<li>IDLE (the editor<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> that ships with Python)</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools are designed to<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> work with a wide range of programming languages and can generally be easily customized to add support for emerging languages. Enhanced editors<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> offer some common features that make a developer’s life a little nicer, such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax highlighting, which color codes keywords and other semantic elements in your code.</li>
<li>Macros, which allow the developer to record and play back common keystrokes</li>
<li>Project and file organization to allow easy switching between multiple files that make up a project</li>
<li>Rudimentary code completion to reduce the amount of typing needed to write your code</li>
<li>Plugin support for other niceties such as linters, spell checkers, file previews for your code, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, some of these enhanced editors have become very robust because you can customize and expand their capabilities. When you consider these tools as they are right out of the box, they are more useful and specialized than general text editors, but they fall short of qualifying as IDEs.</p>
<p>At the top of the code editor food chain is <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>the <strong class="bold">IDE</strong>. If you were to look inside the cockpit of a fighter plane from the World War I era, you’d see a few simple controls and nothing more. If that’s a text editor, the IDE is the cockpit of a Boeing 747 aircraft. Every tool a developer could ever desire or need is crammed into a comparably complex UI. IDEs contain all the features of an enhanced text editor, but usually offer the following additional enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some easy ways to run your code right from the editor.</li>
<li>Tooling to help manage <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>your source code repository, such <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>as <strong class="bold">Git</strong> or <strong class="bold">Subversion</strong>.</li>
<li>An integrated, easy-to-use debugger, which allows you to pause the execution of a running program and inspect or alter its current state.</li>
<li>Tools to help you write automated tests such as unit tests and run and visualize the results.</li>
<li>Complex code completion is based on the introspection or indexing of the code in your project. In modern IDEs, this is enhanced using <strong class="bold">artificial </strong><strong class="bold">intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>).</li>
<li>Profiling tools to help you find execution bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Integrated tooling to help with supplementary systems, such as databases.</li>
<li>Tools for deploying your code to a server or cloud environment right from the IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some popular examples of<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> IDEs include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio (this is different from Visual Studio Code)</li>
<li>PyCharm</li>
<li>IntelliJ IDEA</li>
<li>NetBeans</li>
<li>Apple Xcode</li>
<li>Xamarin Studio</li>
<li>Eclipse</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the IDE is<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> the most powerful weapon in your coding arsenal. It is important to use the best one available to you. If you are new to software development, or maybe even not-so-new, you might wonder why the enhanced editors are so popular. At the time of writing, roughly 50% of developers use Visual Studio Code, which is not on my list of IDEs.</p>
<p>Many developers prefer a more “lightweight” development environment. This is especially true of frontend web developers who swear by Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code. In truth, they need all the features of the IDE, and they use them, but they are spread out across different tools they use throughout the day. A frontend developer relies on profilers and debuggers that run in web browsers and they don’t need those tools in an IDE. Instead, they can get a simpler editor that downloads quickly, installs simply, and runs instantly when they click the icon in their OS.</p>
<p>I submit that if you are doing full stack web development or mobile development, or you need to work servers or containers, an <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>IDE is a better choice.</p>
<p>There exists a certain class of software developer who swears you should never use anything other than the simplest possible tools. They believe that reliance on a tool to do coding and related hard work diminishes the overall mastery and accomplishment needed to be considered proficient. I couldn’t disagree more. One year, while at the monastery, the Master told me a story of a great swordsman from Japan named Miyamoto Musashi. In his day, every samurai knew of Musashi as the greatest living swordsman and all the samurai wanted to take a shot at defeating him. Back then, duels were usually fought to the death. One day, a dueling challenger met Musashi as he was getting off a boat. Musashi was unarmed. The challenger waited until Musashi could fashion a wooden sword, called a <em class="italic">bokken</em>, from one of the boat’s oars, which he intended to use in the dual. Legend has it Musashi made a fool of that challenger and left him alive, much to the challenger’s disgrace. Musashi, the Master said, was the finest warrior who ever lived, and his skill with a sword has never since been matched. However, if the objective were simply to defeat him, I could have easily done so with a machine gun.</p>
<p>In my opinion, limiting the tools you use owing to a sense of pride in your capability, or lack thereof, is foolish. The objective of a software developer is to ship software, usually on an unforgiving deadline. It isn’t to waste time trying to prove yourself to someone else’s standards, unless, of course, you’re a degree-seeking student. I’m sure there are a few of you reading this book. Play the game and do what your professors say. You should realize that once you graduate, everything changes. You will be expected to produce code quickly, accurately, and consistently. This is best achieved via the automation available in a good IDE. You should choose the best tool for the job at hand. I found PyCharm helped me to become productive while I was learning the Python language. When you start, and you’re not using an editor that corrects your line spacing and indents, you’re going to make a lot of silly mistakes. It’s frustrating. I’d think to myself, “If I were using C#, I’d be done by now.” I was even tempted to abandon Python and PyCharm for something more comfortable. However, that’s not what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>PyCharm<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> will underline all those silly mistakes for you and correct them with the touch of a button! I learned, after seeing those mistakes underlined over and over, what to do when I’m using an editor without code inspection. Today, when I am working in other languages, I still use Python rules. Having learned Python with the help of PyCharm, I was able to ship faster, learn faster, and improve my code in other languages and tools. Do me a favor and never let anybody tell you you’re not a <em class="italic">real developer</em> because you didn’t do something their way. If they persist, tell them nano is better than vi or Emacs, and just walk away. Such a statement will probably cause their head to explode.</p>
<p>I’d like to make one more comment about Visual Studio Code. This editor has evolved through plugins to the point where it can compete with a fully featured IDE. However, this comes at a cost compared to a professionally developed IDE such as PyCharm. To get the identical features you’d find in PyCharm in Visual Studio Code, you’d need to install a large number of plugins. These plugins are all written by the community, which means they are all independent development efforts. These plugins will never work as cohesively as the base features you will find in an IDE such as PyCharm. This is also true when comparing Visual Studio with Visual Studio Code. Try creating a C# project in Visual Studio versus Visual Studio Code and you’ll find the process is dreamy and smooth in Visual Studio. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, requires a lot of command-line work and lots of weird plugin installations. The experience just isn’t the same. The same observation holds with other editors such as vim, which can be heavily customized. You’ll spend a week messing with plugins and open source scripts to achieve, at best, partial parity with an IDE’s out-of-the-box functionality.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>PyCharm as a Python IDE</h1>
<p>It’s all well and good to talk about tool comparisons common to other languages. But we don’t care about that, do we? We want to know our options for Python! The best IDEs are typically specialized. PyCharm<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> is specialized in working with Python. That’s it. When you create a new project in PyCharm, you’ll see options for Python projects and nothing else. Contrast this experience with Visual Studio. In my opinion, Visual Studio is the only close competitor to PyCharm when it comes to working with Python projects. When a project is created in Visual Studio, you will most likely spend a good five minutes trying to wade through the myriad of options. The IDE supports dozens of languages, and that is compounded by a dozen project types such as web, desktop, and others. Visual Studio is trying to be all things to all developers. PyCharm only wants to play with Python developers.</p>
<p>PyCharm itself was created with a few design goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligent coding assistance</li>
<li>Streamlined programming tools</li>
<li>Web development options</li>
<li>Scientific computing support</li>
<li>Visual debugging and performance profiling</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll take a look at each of these design goals in turn, but first, I need to point something out. At the time I’m writing this, PyCharm<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> is about to go through a big change. JetBrains is working on a brand-new user experience. By the time this book is published, there is a strong chance that this new UI will be the default. If you’re new to PyCharm, you should understand that you’re going to see it in two different ways for a while. The classic UI will continue to be available in the product for a time, allowing us to ease into the new experience. I’ve decided I’m going to embrace the new UI given the time between the first edition and this one is a few years. That said, it bears mentioning that you’re going to see the classic UI alongside the new UI until probably late 2024 when the old UI is no longer maintained. It will become deprecated and one day will disappear into the sands of time like Shelley’s fabled statue of Ozymandias:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4: The new UI (top) compared to the classic UI (bottom)</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.4</em> shows the two UIs side by side. The design objective of the new UI is to reduce the clutter in the interface. They’re not wrong on that point. As the tool has grown over the years, more and more features have been crammed into the menus, making the UI a little bit daunting for new users. The biggest thing to realize is that most of the things you’d find in the menu are still there, but the menu system itself is hidden beneath the hamburger icon in the top-left corner of the screen. Don’t worry; I’ll cover this in detail later. As I write this, there is a setting we’ll review in <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Installing and Configuring PyCharm</em>, that allows you to toggle between the classic and new UIs.</p>
<p>I wanted to point this out now because you’re about to see some screenshots, and if you’ve seen the old UI, you might think you’ve picked up the wrong book. You haven’t. Just the opposite. If I time this right, you’ll be the only one with the right book.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Intelligent coding assistance</h2>
<p>I’m going to tell you something my wife<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> says all the time. I’m very lazy. Wait. That <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>came out wrong. She is saying that I’m lazy. I’m not saying that she is saying she is lazy. Sheesh. Writing is hard! I almost dug a hole there, didn’t I?</p>
<p>She’s not wrong. As a developer, I am essentially very lazy. I refuse to spend hours or even minutes doing something the long way. The Greeks had a legend about a guy named Sisyphus who was cursed to push a stone up a steep hill. As soon as he reached the top, the stone would roll back down the hill. Sisyphus was stuck in an infinite loop with no <em class="italic">Cmd</em>/<em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">C</em> option on his keyboard.</p>
<p>Here’s one thing I know: Sisyphus was not a software developer! Any software developer would have rolled that stone exactly twice, after which they would have spent eternity devising a system of pulleys and cranes controlled by an IoT device. Naturally, the microcontroller would be running a Python script. I digress.</p>
<p>What <em class="italic">some</em> (I say in my head looking in my unsuspecting wife’s direction) might call lazy, I call <em class="italic">efficient</em>! As a developer, I want to create maximum effect with minimal effort in everything I do. Writing code is complicated. You are writing instructions for the most stubborn and unintelligent object ever devised. Coding is worse than trying to teach a 2-year-old to tie their shoes. Trust me, I’ve done both! Coders must be extremely specific and verbose in their explanation of any operations they want to perform. Furthermore, things are made worse by the language developers out there who tend to want to force users to write a bunch of boilerplate code. I’m talking about the excise code that has nothing to do with the code you want to write or the problem you want to solve. Python generally avoids this, so let me give an example of possibly the worst offender: Java.</p>
<p>Back in the day when I was a wee lad, Java was all the rage. There was this caste of corporate programmers involved with Java who thought up something called <strong class="bold">Enterprise Java Beans</strong> (<strong class="bold">EJBs</strong>). EJBs were <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>supposed to be the epitome of module programming with reusable objects. It was an absolute beating to implement. Rather than simply making a class, which is all you need, you had to create a special file structure with various folders and manifest files to expose what was in the bean, and it was all compiled into a special format. It turned out that the special format was nothing more than a ZIP file. It took a lot of work just to make an EJB, which meant developers had to make a ton of files and write a lot of code just to get started on the functionality they needed to express to get their work done. That’s what we mean by <em class="italic">boilerplate</em>. Boilerplate is generally useless but necessary because, without it, the code doesn’t work.</p>
<p>All IDEs have evolved because of this phenomenon. PyCharm evolved from JetBrains’ Java IDE, IntelliJ. Python doesn’t usually have a lot of boilerplate required for your code to work, but it does come up. There are two kinds of boilerplate. The boilerplate needed to make old-school EJBs work is the bad kind. The boilerplate generated as a means to jumpstart your project is the good kind. As we’ll see, PyCharm, as with most IDEs, generates a folder structure, a set of files, and some basic code to get you started. That can be considered boilerplate. But in this case, that code isn’t retained. It is replaced by the real code for your project. The code generated by the IDE is just a mental prompt to get you going. It prevents you from having to create your project’s starting point by hand.</p>
<p>All this is great, but boilerplate <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>code generation isn’t what we usually<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> think about when we hear “intelligent coding assistance.” We usually think of the feature pioneered by Microsoft called <strong class="bold">IntelliSense</strong>. If you’ll allow me to anthropomorphize the IDE for a moment, this feature <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>watches as you type your code. All the while, the IDE is thinking about what you’re trying to do. When it sees a way it can help, such as by completing a word or line for you automatically, it presents that as an option. I have an intelligent person completing all my sentences for me: she’s my wife. When she completes my sentences for me, they are usually more organized and intelligent than they would have been if I were on my own. (This might be another reason she thinks I’m lazy.)</p>
<p>I want to point out that not all tools with an IntelliSense-like feature are created equally. When you see this feature in an enhanced editor, it usually works differently than it would in an IDE. In enhanced editors, they use keyword lists to highlight and autocomplete the elements of a language. Really good enhanced editors might index your code and recognize variable and function names and use statistics to give you the most likely completion first. That option is generally followed by a long list of noise comprising every possibility that exists for a given completion. Code completion is becoming very advanced with the introduction of AI tools, and this makes the difference between IDEs and enhanced editors a little muddier, at least on this point. Tools such as GitHub’s Copilot can not only autocomplete variable names and keywords but also write entire sections of your code automatically.</p>
<p>It is important to remember, at least as I write this, that those AI features are not part of the IDE or enhanced editor. They are implemented as plugins. Since this is true, I’ll continue espousing the merits of IDEs, and PyCharm in particular, based solely on the merits of the software by itself. We’ll discuss plugins in <a href="B19644_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor401"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">More Possibilities with </em><em class="italic">PyCharm Plugins</em>.</p>
<p>While enhanced editors might present you with a long list of possibilities for your code completion, PyCharm can analyze your code and perform more intelligent autocompletion. You also get code analysis, such as duplicate code warnings. A common antipattern in software development is copying and pasting code across or even within the same project. It’s a terrible but common thing to see. PyCharm will spot duplicate code and flag it for you so that you can be reminded to refactor the duplicated code into a function or module that can be reused and maintained in one location.</p>
<p>PyCharm can also perform a <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>static analysis of your code. This type of analysis <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>is looking for antipatterns within the code itself; for example, PyCharm will detect dead code like that shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.5</em>. Concerning Python development, PyCharm will automatically format your indentations and give you critical feedback on how your code conforms to <strong class="bold">PEP-8</strong> conventions, which are <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>stylistic requirements you must meet to be considered <em class="italic">pythonic</em> (that’s a good thing).</p>
<p>For example, if you were to type the following code into a new file in PyCharm, you’d see PyCharm’s warning that you have created unreachable code on line 13. The text on that line is highlighted. Hovering your mouse over this highlighted line reveals what is wrong:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
def print_hi(name):
  print(f'Hi, {name}')
  for x in range(25):
    print(str(x))
    if x == 12:
      return
<strong class="bold">      print("You'll never make it here")</strong>
if __name__ == '__main__':
  print_hi('PyCharm')</pre> <p>The <code>print_hi</code> function starts innocuously enough by printing to the console whatever is passed into the function within the <code>name</code> argument. After that, we create a loop that will run 25 times. On each run of the loop, we print out <code>x</code>, which contains the current iteration. When the counter variable, <code>x</code>, reaches 12, the loop exits via the <code>return</code> function, which, as luck has it, is on line 12. I assure you, this is purely a coincidence. Since the loop returns on<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> line 12, the<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> code on line 13 will never be reached:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.5: PyCharm will highlight many common coding mistakes such as this one. The code on line 13 is unreachable, which is indicated when you hover your mouse over the highlighted code" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.05.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.5: PyCharm will highlight many common coding mistakes such as this one. The code on line 13 is unreachable, which is indicated when you hover your mouse over the highlighted code</p>
<p>PyCharm also allows you to navigate between files in a complex project by helping you find where functions, variables, and classes are defined, as well as where they are used. Over time, you’ll learn a set of keystrokes that will allow you to move anywhere in your project without your fingers leaving the keyboard.</p>
<p>In essence, PyCharm’s <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>intelligent coding assistance allows you to worry<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> less about mistakes and more about your logic and requirements, which allows you to complete your code more quickly with fewer mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Streamlined programming tools</h2>
<p>Writing <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>code is but one activity a developer performs each<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> day in pursuit of a project deadline. Great developers also spend time debugging, testing, and profiling their products to produce the best possible result. We also need to deal with pushing code to testing servers, refactoring (other people’s) bad code, working with databases, and dealing with containers. There is tooling in PyCharm for each of these processes and more. When I write complicated web applications in PyCharm, the only tools I usually have open are PyCharm and a web browser: two tools each on their own monitor.</p>
<h3>The PyCharm debugger</h3>
<p>My favorite feature and the one that got <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>me excited the first time I used PyCharm is the debugger. PyCharm’s debugger is great. It is much better than the standard debugger you get with Python itself. Python ships with a debugger called <strong class="bold">Python Debugger</strong> (<strong class="bold">pdb</strong>). In my humble<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> opinion, I’d rather eat bugs off the sidewalk than use this tool. I alluded to this earlier in this chapter. I grew up using Microsoft debuggers and simply nothing else will do. PyCharm’s debugger works exactly as I would expect. Click your mouse at the line where you want execution to stop to make a breakpoint and click the debug button in the IDE, and the program runs and stops at the indicated line. You will get a screen where you can inspect both the state of the stack as well as the terminal output. It’s very simple to use, and I’ll be showing you how to do so in <a href="B19644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Seamless Testing, Debugging, </em><em class="italic">and Profiling.</em></p>
<h3>Running tests with the graphical test runner</h3>
<p>Testing tools are<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> integrated <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>in the form of test runners. PyCharm supports all the major testing frameworks, including <strong class="bold">pytest</strong>, <strong class="bold">nose</strong>, and <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>the regular unit test features from the standard library. Again, I’m coming from experiencing some very good IDEs, and in this case, I’m remembering Eclipse and Visual Studio, which both include graphical test runners. The adage <em class="italic">If the bar is green, the code is clean</em> is visually implemented in PyCharm. You can see an example in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.6</em>. You can run your tests and see a list display showing what passed and what failed, though it is a list rather than a bar. You can then rerun your failing tests until they work.</p>
<p>I’ll give you a simple example. In <code>main.py</code> within this chapter’s source code, I have one file called <code>main.py</code> and another called <code>test_main.py</code>. The content of <code>main.py</code> is a simple function that adds two numbers together:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
def add_two_numbers(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:
  return a + b</pre> <p>Within the <code>test_main.py</code> file, there is a simple unit test:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
from unittest import TestCase
from main import add_two_numbers
class Test(TestCase):
  def test_add_two_numbers(self):
    self.assertTrue(add_two_numbers(a=5, b=6) == 11, \
      "Should be 11")
  def test_show_a_fail(self):
    self.fail()</pre> <p>The <code>Test</code> class contains<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> two tests: one that will pass and one that will automatically fail. I usually make the automatically failing test first just to make sure I have my test class set up properly. Then, later, I remove the fail because of my dopamine addiction, which is only satisfied by green checkmarks in the test runner, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.6</em>. If I right-click on <code>test_main.py</code>, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, I’ll get an option to run the tests within the file:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.6: Right-click the test_main.py file and click Run ‘Python tests in test…’ to run the unit tests contained within the file" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.06.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6: Right-click the test_main.py file and click Run ‘Python tests in test…’ to run the unit tests contained within the file</p>
<p>Look to the <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>lower-left corner in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.7</em>, which shows the test run’s completion, and you’ll see a list of tests that passed or failed with either a green check or a yellow X showing failure. Like all figures in this book, which are printed in black and white, you won’t see the colors. Color ink is expensive, and your father is right, money doesn’t grow on trees:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.7: PyCharm’s built-in test runner shows a traditional pass/fail list (lowe﻿r-left pane) to indicate passing and failing tests" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.07.jpg"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.7: PyCharm’s built-in test runner shows a traditional pass/fail list (lower-left pane) to indicate passing and failing tests</p>
<h3>PyCharm’s profiling tools</h3>
<p>Similarly, code profiling is built in <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>and easy to use. You can click the <strong class="bold">Profile</strong> button to run the<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> code. When the program exits, you will get a graph of each function call, along with the time and resources consumed by the call. This makes it easy to spot unrealized opportunities for improvement concerning the speed of execution and resource consumption.</p>
<p>Consider the possibility that you have an algorithm in your program that might not be performing as you’d like. I know, I know, it would never happen to you, so supposed you just got hired, and the person they fired wrote this horribly performing algorithm. Maybe pretend it is 1956, and the guy who got fired from your new employer, New York Life Insurance Company, was one <strong class="bold">Edward Harry Friend</strong>. Friend wrote a paper titled <em class="italic">Sorting on Electronic Computer Systems</em>, which is likely the first published instance of an algorithm we know today<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> as <strong class="bold">bubble sort</strong>. If Friend had written his algorithm in Python 3, it might look a little like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
def bubble_sort(input_array):
  length_of_array = len(input_array)</pre> <p>Friend has just created a function that accepts a list as an argument, which in our case will be an array of integers. The objective is to sort these numbers. To do this, let’s create two loops, one inside the other:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
  for i in range(length_of_array):
    for j in range(0, length_of_array - i - 1):
      if input_array[j] &gt; input_array[j + 1]:
        input_array[j], input_array[j + 1] = \
        input_array[j + 1], input_array[j]</pre> <p>Within these loops, each number is compared with the number before it. If it is determined those two numbers are out of order, they are swapped. In the next run of the loop, this happens again with the next two numbers, and this continues until it reaches the end of the list.</p>
<p>If you’ve studied<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> algorithms at all, you’ve probably heard of bubble sort, and you’ve been<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> warned as to why it is not used. It is very slow. We have a <code>for</code> loop within another <code>for</code> loop, which is fine if the size of your unsorted list is small. But this algorithm slows down at a logarithmic rate as the list of numbers grows. Algorithm performance is measured<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> using <strong class="bold">big O notation</strong>. I don’t want to turn this into an algorithm book, so I’ll just tell you that a loop inside another loop will scale poorly in terms of performance. In big O notation, we classify this algorithm as <em class="italic">O</em>(<em class="italic">n</em>2). That’s bad.</p>
<p>In plain English, this means that if you double the count of numbers to sort (<em class="italic">n</em>), then your algorithm will take 22 or 4 times longer to process. If you multiply your count’s size by 5, then it becomes 52 or 25 times slower. The bigger the list, the slower it sorts.</p>
<p>To show off the performance tool, we’re going to give this test run a list of 100,000 numbers to sort. Now is a good time to point out I’m running an Intel i9 processor. If you’re a student or some other budget-constrained consumer rocking an i3 processor (or worse), you might want to take the list of numbers down a few zeros if you want to try this out. It takes a good while on my i9:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
test_array = []
for x in range(100000):
  test_array.append(random.randint(1, 10000))</pre> <p>Let’s finish the test code by calling the function and printing the results:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
bubble_sort(test_array)
print("The result of the sort is:")
for i in range(len(test_array)):
  print(test_array[i])</pre> <p>We’ll cover the profiling <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>tool extensively in <a href="B19644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Seamless Testing, Debugging, and Profiling</em>, but for now, let’s just run this code with the profiler and review <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>the result. To run the profiler on the <code>performance.py</code> file, simply right-click the file and click <strong class="bold">More Run/Debug</strong>, then <strong class="bold">Profile ‘performance’</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.8</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.8: Right-click the file you’d like to profile and click More Run/Debug | Profile ‘performance’ to see a performance profile" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.08.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.8: Right-click the file you’d like to profile and click More Run/Debug | Profile ‘performance’ to see a performance profile</p>
<p>Remember, if you use <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>the same code I did, this will take a long time to run, especially <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>on a slower computer. Feel free to adjust the size of the list downward if it’s taking too long to run. The result is a <code>.pstat</code> file that displays as a table in PyCharm. Again, we’ll cover this more extensively in <a href="B19644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Seamless Testing, Debugging, and Profiling</em>. You can see the performance report in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.9</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.9: PyCharm’s resource profiler shows the performance bottlenecks in a running program" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.09.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.9: PyCharm’s resource profiler shows the performance bottlenecks in a running program</p>
<p>As you can see, 84.4% of the program’s time is spent in the <code>bubble_sort</code> function, which is the bottleneck. PyCharm has told you where to concentrate your refactoring efforts to improve the performance of your program.</p>
<h3>Publishing from the IDE</h3>
<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>need to publish your code to a testing server, and you aren’t using a continuous integration system for that, you can use PyCharm. To be clear, you should use a continuous integration system, but I often use the PyCharm features early in a project before the continuous integration system is operational to get code up for stakeholders to play with. You can deploy<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> using <strong class="bold">file transfer protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">FTP</strong>) or <strong class="bold">secure file transfer protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">SFTP</strong>), or <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>copy directly to a network share for a quick and easy way to share your progress with anyone who might want to review it.</p>
<h3>Refactoring tools</h3>
<p>PyCharm has robust <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>refactoring tools <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>you’d expect from a proper IDE. If you want to change a variable name, or even a method signature on a function, right-click and select the <strong class="bold">Refactor</strong> tool. Rest assured the changes you make will carry over to all related instances in your project, not just in the file you are editing. <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.10</em> shows an example of this in action:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.10: PyCharm has a full ﻿selection of refactoring tools available" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.10.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.10: PyCharm has a full selection of refactoring tools available</p>
<p>In addition to renaming a variable or function, there are other actions you can perform, such as changing the method signature and changing the structure of your object-oriented classes.</p>
<h3>Working with databases in PyCharm</h3>
<p>If you work with <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>databases, the<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> Professional edition of PyCharm includes a graphical table editor and SQL support for dozens of popular databases. Check it out in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.11</em>. I’ll talk more about the Professional edition of PyCharm a little later in this chapter; we’ll have a whole chapter on the database features in <a href="B19644_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor266"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Understanding Database Management </em><em class="italic">with PyCharm</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 1.11: PyCharm has a robust and complete set of tools for working with relational databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, Postgres, and many more" src="img/B19644_Figure_1.11.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.11: PyCharm has a robust and complete set of tools for working with relational databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, Postgres, and many more</p>
<p>As you can see, a <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>great many <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>relational and NoSQL databases are directly supported.</p>
<h3>Remote development, containers, and virtual machines</h3>
<p>Finally, but not<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> exhaustively, PyCharm <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>has features for working with remote <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>systems via <strong class="bold">SSH</strong>, local virtual machines using HashiCorp’s <strong class="bold">Vagrant</strong>, and<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> extensive <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>support <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>for <strong class="bold">Docker</strong> containers.</p>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of what PyCharm can do for you, but by now, you get the point. Every tool you might need is integrated into the development environment. That’s probably why they called it an <em class="italic">integrated </em><em class="italic">development environment</em>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Web development options</h2>
<p>I’d wager that more than half<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> the developers working in Python need, at some<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> point, a web project. Whether you’re like me and you’re making a SaaS offering as a fully realized web application, or you are doing rocket science and you need a way to visualize and interactively share your latest fast-Fourier transform on deep space radio emissions data, web projects are usually inevitable. I’m not a scientist and I made that up. If the last sentence made sense to anyone, it was pure coincidence.</p>
<p>Working with web projects offers a new and separate layer of complexity. Most use three-tier designs commonly expressed with<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> the <strong class="bold">model-view-controller</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVC</strong>) pattern. If you’re not sure what this means, stay tuned because there’s a whole section of this book dedicated to web development. For now, this means the application has a frontend where the user can interact, a middle tier containing connective logic, and a database tier for structured data storage and retrieval. Only the middle tier is done in Python. We’ll extensively cover web development in later chapters, but for now, I want to tell you about the level of tooling you get with PyCharm.</p>
<p>The company that made PyCharm, JetBrains, makes a variety of IDEs targeted at different languages. One of their IDEs is specifically targeted toward web development. It is called <strong class="bold">WebStorm</strong>. I said<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> earlier that good IDEs target one language. WebStorm targets JavaScript; specifically, we’re talking about full stack JavaScript. Modern JavaScript execution occurs in two places. Traditionally, JavaScript was always executed in the browser. About 10 years ago, <strong class="bold">Node.js</strong> was <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>released and JavaScript was released from the confines of the browser window and allowed to run on the backend.</p>
<p>Earlier, I alluded to a robust set of features in PyCharm for working with databases. JetBrains also has an IDE that targets SQL database developers<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> called <strong class="bold">DataGrip</strong>. As it happens, the Professional edition of PyCharm includes the entire feature set available in WebStorm and DataGrip. When you buy the Professional edition, you’re getting three JetBrains products in one package: PyCharm, WebStorm, and DataGrip. When you use PyCharm to work on web projects, you need all three feature sets and they are there for you in the Professional edition.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Scientific computing support</h2>
<p>The growth of the data science field<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> has played an important role in the <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>growth of Python itself, and Python is now the most common programming tool used in scientific projects (even more common<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> than <strong class="bold">R</strong>). Notable functionalities included in PyCharm that facilitate data science work are the integration <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>of <strong class="bold">IPython</strong>, <strong class="bold">Jupyter</strong> notebooks, and <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>an interactive console. The support for scientific computing in PyCharm is detailed in section four of this book, starting from <a href="B19644_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Turning On Scientific Mode</em>. PyCharm also provides a customized view that optimally organizes workspaces in a scientific project called <strong class="bold">SciView</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.12</em>:</p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Understanding the Professional, Community, and Educational editions</h2>
<p>There are three editions<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> to PyCharm. I’ve alluded to two, because the third is a special <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>version that is only useful to teachers, and the focus of this book is application development, not software development instruction. I’ll tell you about each, but I know what you want is a feature comparison chart. You’ll find it in <em class="italic">Figure 1</em><em class="italic">.13</em>:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.13: A feature comparison chart showing the features contained in the free Community edition versus the paid Professional version</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Community edition</strong> is free <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>but only offers a limited set of features compared to the Professional edition. It is perfect for working on projects that only entail <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>working with Python. The product I work on has a set of Python scripts <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>that batch-process large amounts of data. Everything happens in Python and this is the perfect use case for the Community edition. If all you need is a terrific Python IDE, use the free version. The Community edition is also perfect if you are just working on automation scripts, such as graphics pipelines for 3D computer graphics, or general IT task automation.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Professional edition</strong> has all<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> the features of the free version but adds web<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> development, database, remote development, containerization, and scientific project types. This is aimed at professionals who produce publishable software projects. While it is not free, JetBrains is pretty good about keeping it affordable with several pricing options, depending on how you are using the tool. Solo developers may obtain licenses at a lower price point than corporate developers. There are also ways to get the Professional edition free of charge, such as proving that you are using PyCharm<a id="_idIndexMarker114"/> on a <strong class="bold">fully open source software</strong> (<strong class="bold">FOSS</strong>) project. Start-up companies might be eligible for a 50% discount, and if you’re teaching in a code boot camp or a university setting, you may also qualify for free professional licenses. Since these things can fluctuate over time, you should check the JetBrains website for full details at <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/</a>.</p>
<p>I said earlier there are three editions of PyCharm, and we’ve only covered two. The <strong class="bold">Educational edition</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>aimed at teachers and university professors developing <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>curricula to teach Python. This edition can create and play back interactive lessons right in the IDE. It is only valuable to teachers, instructors, and content creators.</p>
<p>In this book, I will focus on the features present in the Community edition and the Professional edition.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we introduced the Python language itself, as well as the background behind Python IDEs in general and, specifically, PyCharm.</p>
<p>We also discussed the usability of PyCharm for Python programmers. Specifically, to be able to take full advantage of all the features and functionalities that PyCharm offers without becoming too dependent on the IDE, a programmer should first master the fundamentals of the Python language and its core syntax. We also looked at comparisons between PyCharm itself and various other Python editors/IDEs and the reason why PyCharm is considered the best development environment of them all.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared the two editions of PyCharm that are available for download: the paid Professional edition and the free Community edition. If you are working with large, complex projects with many moving parts, including database management, web development languages, and viewability in scientific reports, then you will most likely benefit from using the Professional edition.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you will learn how to download PyCharm, set it up on your system, and configure its environment for your Python projects. This will serve as the first step in getting started with PyCharm, after which we will start discussing the specific features PyCharm offers that this book covers.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Questions</h1>
<p>Answer the following questions to test your knowledge of this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programmers typically develop their code with an editor or an IDE. What is the difference between the two, and which one is PyCharm?</li>
<li>Why might some think that an IDE for Python development might be inappropriate or unnecessary?</li>
<li>What are some key features of PyCharm? Of those features, which give PyCharm an edge over other editors/IDEs?</li>
<li>What advantage does PyCharm have over editors such as Visual Studio Code or vim, which can be configured to perform many of the same features offered by PyCharm?</li>
<li>What are the three editions of PyCharm? What are the key differences between them?</li>
</ol>

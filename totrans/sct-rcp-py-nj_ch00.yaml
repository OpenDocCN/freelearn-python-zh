- en: Many readers might feel that they have mastered the Python language and know
    everything it takes to write applications that utilize the best features of the
    language. This book aims to delve into aspects of Python and related technology
    that some developers have never experienced.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book will unveil little-known or misunderstood aspects of Python related
    to the implementation of the standard library and provide understanding of how
    the modules actually work. The book shows the proper implementation of collections
    and the math module, along with numbers such as decimals and fractions that will
    help readers expand their horizons. Readers will learn about decorators, context
    managers, coroutines, and generator functions before learning about internal special
    methods in detail. The book explores the CPython interpreter, covering command
    options that can change how the environment functions as well as alternative interactive
    shells that improve on the normal Python experience. Readers will take a tour
    of the PyPy project, where they will be exposed to several new ways to improve
    speed and concurrency of their applications. Several Python Enhancement Proposals
    of the latest versions are reviewed to see what will be coming in the future of
    Python. Finally, it provides information on the different ways to document Python
    code.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intermediate knowledge of Python is required though many topics are covered
    in a way that even beginners should have an understanding of the basic principles
    being covered. Specifically, the experience of using both the interactive Python
    interpreter and writing Python files, how to import modules, and how to work with
    object-oriented principles is assumed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book uses Python 3.6 for the examples, unless otherwise indicated. While
    alternative implementations are briefly discussed, the book assumes the basic
    CPython implementation is being used.

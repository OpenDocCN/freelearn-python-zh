- en: Multimedia applications are used in a broad spectrum of fields. Writing applications
    that work with images, videos, and other sensory effects is great. Not every application
    gets to make full use of audio/visual effects, but a certain amount of multimedia
    makes any application very appealing.

- en: This book is all about multimedia processing using Python. This step by step
    guide gives you a hands-on experience with developing exciting multimedia applications.
    You will build applications for processing images, creating 2D animations and
    processing audio and video.

- en: There are numerous multimedia libraries for which Python bindings are available.
    These libraries enable working with different kinds of media, such as images,
    audio, video, games, and so on. This book introduces the reader to some of these
    (open source) libraries through several implausibly exciting projects. Popular
    multimedia frameworks and libraries, such as GStreamer, Pyglet, QT Phonon, and
    Python Imaging library are used to develop various multimedia applications.

    teaches you a few things about popular multimedia frameworks for multimedia processing
    using Python and shows you how to develop a simple interactive application using
    PyGame.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Working with Images"), *Working with Images*
    explains basic image conversion and manipulation techniques using the Python Imaging
    Library. With the help of several examples and code snippets, we will perform
    some basic manipulations on the image, such as pasting an image on to another,
    resizing, rotating/flipping, cropping, and so on. We will write tools to capture
    a screenshot and convert image files between different formats. The chapter ends
    with an exciting project where we develop an image processing application with
    a graphical user interface.'

    how to add special effects to an image using Python Imaging Library. You will
    learn techniques to enhance digital images using image filters, for example, reducing
    ''noise'' from a picture, smoothing and sharpening images, embossing, and so on.
    The chapter will cover topics such as selectively changing the colors within an
    image. We will develop some exiting utilities for blending images together, adding
    transparency effects, and creating watermarks.'

    introduces you to the fundamentals of developing animations using Python and Pyglet
    multimedia application development frameworks. We will work on some exciting projects
    such as animating a fun car out for a ride in a thunderstorm, a ''bowling animation''
    with keyboard controls, and so on.'

    teaches you how to get to grips with the primer on GStreamer multimedia framework
    and use this API for audio and video processing. In this chapter, we will develop
    some simple audio processing tools for ''everyday use''. We will develop tools
    such as a command-line audio player, a file format converter, an MP3 cutter and
    audio recorder.'

- en: While you’re reading this, you’ve already been introduced to Odoo, one of the
    fastest-growing open-source ERP Business suites. Odoo is a full-featured open-source
    platform that assists in building solutions for various industries. If you’re
    a developer, you’re sitting on a goldmine. If you’re an end user, you’re gifted
    with an amazing tool to simplify your business processes, covering everything
    from pre-sales to sales, inventory, and accounting.

    a nice dough (mmm, does it remind you of mouthwatering pizza?) that can be molded
    according to your requirements. Technically, it’s a very flexible ORM-controller
    (Object Relational Mapping) driven application development framework built with
    extensibility in mind. Following the rule of inheritance, features/extensions,
    and modifications can be implemented as modules categorized as Apps. With ORM
    mentioned here, Odoo exhibits a monolithic architecture.

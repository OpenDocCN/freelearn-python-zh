    which you will use your imagination and creativity to create things. If you know
    how to program, your possibilities will be endless.

    your life. Maybe you want to become a professional programmer, and then you will
    use your skills to work in teams with others to create solutions that will be
    used by many people for a long time.

    professions. Your job title will not be that of a software developer. Instead,
    programming will be a tool that you can use.

    of all ages, from beginners to senior professional developers. During this time,
    I have seen patterns, especially among beginners.

- en: It took some time before I realized what made so many of my beginner students
    struggle with grasping programming. The problem was that they had to learn two
    things at once. First, they needed to understand the very concepts of programming.
    There are so many concepts and words, both new ones and some that they already
    know, but that have a slightly different meaning. Secondly, they will also need
    to learn a programming language. Taking in all this at the same time will become
    overwhelming for many people. For some, it will be so much that they give up programming
    for good.

- en: The idea of this book is to focus on one of the two things you need to learn.
    This book will not focus on any language, but instead, teach you the concepts
    you need to know and understand to become a programmer. After you have read this
    book, you can learn any programming language you want, and when you do, you can
    focus on just learning the language, as the rest you will already know.

- en: With this book, I also want to put things into context, so there will be a bit
    of history, and some parts will be rather technical. I believe that if you are
    going to learn something, you cannot just scratch the surface. You need to dive
    into it and see how things work.

    programming and wants to know more about the topic, or is about to learn their
    first programming language and wants a solid introduction to the topic. It doesn't
    matter whether your goal is to create small hobby applications or whether you
    want to be well prepared for your university programming courses.

    understanding of some fundamental programming concepts.'

    and How We Organize Our Code*, covers how, when writing programs that are beyond
    the most trivial level, we will need to organize our code into several code files.
    In this chapter, we look at how this can be done efficiently. We will also see
    how we can incorporate code written by others into our software projects.'

    The Basic Building Block of a Computer Program*, outlines how a computer program
    is, at the most fundamental level, built by putting statements in the correct
    sequence. We will see how this is done and how the computer will execute these
    statement sequences when our programs run.'

    of data we will work with when programming and what types of operations we can
    perform on them.'

    of control structures that we can use to accomplish this.'

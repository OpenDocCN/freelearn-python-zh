    now it's the time to make something to which we can hand over some of our daily

    whenever they need it. So technically, once it is set up, you don't really have
    to worry ever about watering your green creatures. Whether you are at your home,
    at the office, or on a vacation, this will keep doing its job no matter what.

    for every problem in this world, there exists a solution. In our case, that solution
    is called a solenoid valve. What it essentially does is switch the flow of liquids.
    There are various solenoid valves available in the market; some of the identifying
    features are as follows:'

    it is open, it will allow the liquid to flow from the inlet to the outlet. However,
    there can be other types of valve such as a three-way valve which might have two
    outlets and one inlet. It would regulate where the flow of the liquid would happen.'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There can be some more specifics in terms of the valves as well, but for now
    that's all we need to know. One thing to notice about the solenoid valve is that
    these valves can either be opened or closed. Achieving any state in between or
    controlling flow via these valves is not possible. For this we can use a servo
    valve or motor valve. But as of now, we don't need it.

    which is normally closed. When you look closely at this valve you will see that
    it operates at 12 volts and the current consumption is close to 1 amp. This is
    a lot of current for Raspberry Pi. The upper limit of current that Raspberry Pi
    can provide per pin is about 50 milliamp. So if we connect this valve to Raspberry
    Pi then it's surely not going to work.

    a relay is to re-lay the circuits. Basically, it's an electronically controlled
    switch. The basic job of a relay is to switch devices that have a higher current/voltage
    consumption than what can be given by a controlling unit on and off. This is a
    fairly simple device, as you can see in the diagram. There are two circuits. One
    is depicted in blue, which is a low voltage and low current circuit. This circuit
    is powering up a coil. The other circuit is depicted in red and black. This circuit
    is a high voltage, high current circuit.

    thing to remember is that there will be two separate ratings for AC and DC voltage
    and current. As our solenoid will be working at 12V, we will only be considering

    it noticed that the moisture value was low, it suddenly pumped water and made
    sure that the humidity of the soil was always more than 20%. However, this is
    not required. In general, we water the garden once or twice a day. If we water
    it more then it might not be good for the plants.

    cheap at a rate of around $2.

    you would be wrong. It has its own data transfer methodology. It is good to have
    one single protocol for all the sensors, but often you will also find that there
    are various sensors or devices which work on a different or an altogether new
    protocol. DHT11 is one such sensor. In this case, we have the choice of either
    understanding the entire methodology of communication or to simply get the library
    from the manufacturer and use it at our disposal. At present we will be opting
    for the latter.

    just for soldering or for future use. This sensor works on a 5V supply and only

<p class="my_basic">Following are some explanations on the conventions used in this book. “Conventions” refer to the standard ways in which certain parts of the text are displayed.</p>
<p class="strong">Python Statements</p>
<p class="my_basic">This book uses plenty of examples written in Python language. Python statements are shown in a typeface that looks like this.</p>
<div><p>This is a Python statement</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Keywords, Variables, Functions/Methods, and Arguments Within the Text of a Paragraph</p>
<p class="my_basic">Keywords, variables, functions/methods, and arguments are sometimes shown within the text of a paragraph. When they are, the special text is shown in a typeface different from that of the rest of the paragraph. For instance, firstName = 5 is an example of a Python statement within the paragraph text.</p>
<p class="strong">Words in Italics</p>
<p class="my_basic">You may notice that some of the special text is also displayed in italics. In this book, italicized words are general types that must be replaced with the specific name appropriate for your data. For example, the general form of a Python statement may be presented as</p>
<div><p>def name(arg1, arg2):</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In order to complete the statement, the keywords name, arg1, and arg2 must be replaced with something meaningful. When you use this statement in your program, you might use it in the following form</p>
<div><p>def displayRectangle(width, height):</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Three dots (…): an Ellipsis</p>
<p class="my_basic">In the general form of a statement you may also notice three dots ( … ), also known as an “ellipsis”, following a list in an example. They are not part of the statement. An ellipsis indicates that you can have as many items in the list as you want. For example, the ellipsis in the general form of the statement</p>
<div><p>displayMessages(arg1, arg2, … )</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">indicates that the list may contain more than two arguments. When you use this statement in your program, your statement might be something like this.</p>
<div><p>displayMessages(message1, "Hello", message2, "Hi!")</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Square Brackets in Italics</p>
<p class="my_basic">The general form of some statements or subprograms may contain “square brackets” [ ] in italics, which indicate that the enclosed section is optional. For example, the general form of the statement</p>
<div><p>range(initial_value, final_value [, step])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">indicates that the section [, step] can be omitted.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For example, the following two statements produce different results but they are both syntactically correct.</p>
<div><p>range(0, 10)</p>
<p>range(0, 10, 2)</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">The Dark Header</p>
<p class="my_basic">Most of this book's examples are shown in a typeface that looks like this.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.2-3</div>
<div><p>a = 2</p>
<p>b = 3</p>
<div></div>
<p>c = a + b</p>
<p>print(c)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The header  <img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.2-3  on top indicates the filename that you must open to test the program. All the examples that contain this header can be downloaded free of charge from my website. </p>
<p class="strong">Notices</p>
<p class="my_basic">Very often this book uses notices to help you better understand the meaning of a concept. Notices look like this.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>This typeface designates a note.</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Something Already Known or Something to Remember</p>
<p class="my_basic">Very often this book can help you recall something you have already learned (probably in a previous section or chapter). Other times, it will draw your attention to something you should memorize. Reminders look like this.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>This typeface designates something to recall or something that you should memorize.</p>
</div>

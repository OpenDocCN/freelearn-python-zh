    in Python programming and wish to leverage the PyCharm integrated development
    environment (IDE) to enhance their coding experience. Here are the primary groups
    of people for whom this book is tailored:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Beginner Programmers**: If you are new to programming or have limited coding
    experience, this book provides a gentle introduction to Python and PyCharm. By
    its very nature, PyCharm makes Python easier to learn by providing a great deal
    of help in setting up project templates, providing auto-completion, and automatic
    PEP-8 formatting for your code.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Intermediate Python Developers**: If you already have some experience with
    Python but want to deepen your knowledge and proficiency, this book along with
    PyCharm can help. PyCharm’s configurable linter and code analysis technology will
    hold your work to the highest standards. Refactoring, a practice that is too often
    neglected, becomes trivial owing to PyCharm’s indexing and refactoring tools.
    You’ll learn to use integrated testing, coverage, and profiling tools to ensure
    your code runs swiftly and reliably.'

- en: '**Experienced Developers from Other Languages**: If you are an experienced
    programmer in another language and want to transition to Python or incorporate
    Python into your skillset, this book will help you bridge the gap and master Python
    programming using PyCharm. This is especially true if you’ve used other PyCharm
    IDEs. If you normally use IntelliJ Idea, WebStorm, Rider, or PHP Storm, you’ll
    be right at home since you’ll be using the same keyboard shortcuts. If you use
    Visual Studio, you can easily configure PyCharm to use the keyboard shortcuts
    you are used to, and we think you’ll find common workflows, like working with
    Git, to be superior and more intuitive in PyCharm.'

    skills for your favorite operating system. One thing to remember throughout is
    that we are covering PyCharm rather than deep development tutorials of frameworks
    mentioned in various chapters. For example, [*Chapter 8*](B19644_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor203)
    covers the PyCharm features designed for Flask development. It isn’t meant to
    be a full tutorial on Flask.

- en: This book is intended for anyone who wants to build software applications or
    hardware projects using the Raspberry Pi. The book gradually introduces text classification,
    creating games, 3D graphics, and sentiment analysis. We also move towards more
    advanced topics, such as building computer vision applications, robots, and neural
    network applications. It would be ideal to have basic understanding of Python;
    however, all programming concepts are explained in detail. All the examples are
    written using Python 3, with clear and detailed explanations of how everything
    works so that you can adapt and use all the information in your own projects.
    By the end of the book, you will have the skills you need to build innovative
    software applications and hardware projects using the Raspberry Pi.

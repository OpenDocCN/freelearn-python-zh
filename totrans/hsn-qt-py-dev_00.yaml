- en: Qt is one of the most widely used and flexible frameworks for GUI application
    development. This book will introduce you to the development of Python-based Qt
    GUI applications with Python bindings such as PyQt and PySide. We will start by
    describing PyQt and PySide GUI elements, and this will be used as a reference
    for the rest of the book. On completion of the book, you will be able to create
    beautiful Python GUI applications from scratch.

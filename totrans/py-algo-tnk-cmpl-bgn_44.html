<h3 id="toc_1">30.1 Introduction</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Variables are a good way to store values in memory but they have one limitation—they can hold only one value at a time. There are many cases, however, where a program needs to keep a large amount of data in memory, and variables are not the best choice.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For example, consider the following exercise:</p>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter three numbers. It then displays them sorted in ascending order.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Consider the following code fragment. It lets the user enter the three numbers.</p>
<div><p>for i in range(3):</p>
<p>number = float(input())</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">When the loop finally finishes iterating, the variable number contains only that last number that was provided. Unfortunately, all the previous two numbers have been lost! Using this code fragment, it is not quite possible to display them sorted in ascending order.</p>
<p class="my_basic">One possible solution would be to use three individual variables, as follows.</p>
<div><p>num1 = float(input())</p>
<p>num2 = float(input())</p>
<p>num3 = float(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>if num1 &lt;= num2 &lt;= num3:</p>
<p>print(num1, num2, num3)</p>
<p>elif num1 &lt;= num3 &lt;= num2:</p>
<p>print(num1, num3, num2)</p>
<p>elif num2 &lt;= num1 &lt;= num3:</p>
<p>print(num2, num1, num3)</p>
<p>elif num2 &lt;= num3 &lt;= num1:</p>
<p>print(num2, num3, num1)</p>
<p>elif num3 &lt;= num1 &lt;= num2:</p>
<p>print(num3, num1, num2)</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print(num3, num2, num1)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Not a perfect solution, but it works! However, what if the wording of this exercise asked the user to enter 1,000 numbers instead of three? Think about it! Can you write a similar Python program for all those numbers? Of course not! Fortunately, there are data structures!</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In computer science, a data structure is a collection of data organized so that you can perform operations on it in the most effective way.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">There are several data structures available in Python, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, frozensets, and strings. Yes, you heard that right! Since a string is a collection of alphanumeric characters, it is considered a data structure.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Beyond strings (for which you have already learned enough), lists and dictionaries are the most commonly used data structures in Python. The following chapters will analyze both of them.</p>
<h3 id="toc_2">30.2 What is a List?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">A list is a type of data structure that can hold multiple values under one common name. It can be thought of as a collection of elements where each element is assigned a unique number known as an index position, or simply an index. Lists are mutable (changeable), which means that once a list is created, the values of its elements can be changed, and new elements can be added to or removed from the list.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Lists in computer science resemble the matrices used in mathematics. A mathematical matrix is a collection of numbers or other mathematical objects, arranged in rows and columns.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In many computer languages, such as Java, C++, and C# (to name a few),  there are no lists. These languages support another kind of data structure that is called an “array”. Lists, however, are more powerful than arrays.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>There are one-dimensional and multidimensional lists. A multidimensional list can be two-dimensional, three-dimensional, four-dimensional, and so on.</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">One-Dimensional Lists</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following example presents a one-dimensional list that holds the grades of six students. The name of the list is grades. For your convenience, the corresponding index is written above each element. By default, in Python, index numbering always starts at zero.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width44" src="img/chapter30-01.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Since index numbering starts at zero, the index of the last element of a list is 1 less than the total number of elements in the list. In the list grades, the index of the last element is 5 while the total number of elements is 6.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">You can think of a list as if it were six individual variables—grades0, grades1, grades2, ... grades5—with each variable holding the grade of one student. The advantage of the list, however, is that it can hold multiple values under one common name.</p>
<p class="strong">Two-Dimensional Lists</p>
<p class="my_basic">In general, multidimensional lists are useful for working with multiple sets of data. For example, suppose you want to hold the daily high temperatures for California for the four weeks of April. One approach would be to use four one-dimensional lists, one for each week. Furthermore, each list would have seven elements, one for each day of the week, as follows.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width31" src="img/chapter30-02.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">However, this approach is a bit awkward because you would have to process each list separately. A better approach would be to use a two-dimensional list with four rows (one for each week) and seven columns (one for each day of the week), as follows.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width34" src="img/chapter30-03.png"/></p>
<p class="strong">Three-Dimensional Lists</p>
<p class="my_basic">The next example shows a three-dimensional list that holds the daily high temperatures for California for the four weeks of April for the years 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width38" src="img/chapter30-04.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that four-dimensional, five-dimensional, or even one-hundred–dimensional lists can exist. However, experience shows that the maximum list dimension that you will need in your life as a programmer is probably two or three.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_3">Exercise 30.2-1 Designing a List</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Design a list that can hold the ages of 8 people, and then add some typical values to the list.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">This is an easy one. All you have to do is design a list with 8 elements (indexes 0 to 7). It can be a list with either one row or one column, as follows.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width38" src="img/chapter30-05.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Keep in mind, however, that there are no lists with one row or one column in Python. These concepts may exist in mathematical matrices (or in your imagination!) but not in Python. The lists in Python are one-dimensional—end of story! If you want to visualize them having one row or one column, that is up to you.</p>
<h4 id="toc_4">Exercise 30.2-2 Designing Lists</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Design the necessary lists to hold the names and the ages of seven people, and then add some typical values to the lists.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">This exercise can be implemented with two lists. Let's design them with one column each.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width34" src="img/chapter30-06.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in the list names and those in the list ages. The first of the seven people is John Thompson, and he is 17 year old. The name “John Thompson” is stored at index 0 of the list names, and at exactly the same index in the list ages, his age is stored. The next person's name (Ava Miller) and her age (25) are stored at index 1 of the lists names, and ages, respectively, and so on.</p>
<h4 id="toc_5">Exercise 30.2-3 Designing Lists</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Design the necessary lists to hold the names of ten people as well as the average weight (in pounds) of each person for January, February, and March. Then add some typical values to the lists.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, you need a one-dimensional list for names, and a two-dimensional list for people's weights, having a one-to-one correspondence between their elements.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width38" src="img/chapter30-07.png"/></p>
<h3 id="toc_6">30.3 Creating One-Dimensional Lists in Python</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Python has many ways to create a list and add elements (and values) to it. Depending on the given problem, it's up to you which one to use.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's try to create the following list using the most common approaches.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width26" src="img/chapter30-08.png"/></p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">To create a list and directly assign values to its elements, you can use the next Python statement, given in general form.</p>
<div><p>list_name = [ value0, value1, value2, …, valueM ]</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►list_name is the name of the list.</p>
<p>►value0, value1, value2, … , valueM are the values of the list elements.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For this approach, you can create the list ages using the following statement:</p>
<div><p>ages = [12, 25, 9, 11]</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Indexes are set automatically. The value 12 is assigned to the element at index position 0, value 25 is assigned to the element at index position 1, and so on. Index numbering always starts at zero by default.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In <a href="chapter05.html#toc_4">Section 5.4</a> you learned about the rules that must be followed when assigning names to variables. Assigning names to lists follows exactly the same rules!</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">You can create a list of size empty elements in Python using the following statement given in general form:</p>
<div><p>list_name = [None] * size</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where size can be any positive integer value, or it can even be a variable that contains any positive integer value.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The next statement creates the list ages with 4 empty elements.</p>
<div><p>ages = [None] * 4</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The statement ages = [None] * 4 reserves four locations in main memory (RAM).</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">To assign a value to a list element, you can use the following statement, given in general form:</p>
<div><p>list_name[index] = value</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where index is the index position of the element in the list.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The next code fragment creates the list ages (reserving four locations in main memory) and then assigns values to its elements.</p>
<div><p>ages = [None] * 4</p>
<div></div>
<p>ages[0] = 12</p>
<p>ages[1] = 25</p>
<p>ages[2] = 9</p>
<p>ages[3] = 11</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The size of the list ages is 4.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Of course, instead of using constant values for index, you can also use variables or expressions, as follows.</p>
<div><p>ages = [None] * 4</p>
<div></div>
<p>k = 0</p>
<div></div>
<p>ages[k] = 12</p>
<p>ages[k + 1] = 25</p>
<p>ages[k + 2] = 9</p>
<p>ages[k + 3] = 11</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Third approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, you can create a totally empty list (without elements) and then add elements (and values) to it using the append() method, as shown in the following Python statements, given in general form.</p>
<div><p>list_name = []</p>
<div></div>
<p>list_name.append(value0)</p>
<p>list_name.append(value1)</p>
<p>list_name.append(value2)</p>
<p>…</div>
<div>list_name.append(valueM)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Using this approach, you can create the list ages using the following code fragment:</p>
<div><p>ages = []</p>
<p>ages.append(12)</p>
<p>ages.append(25)</p>
<p>ages.append(9)</p>
<p>ages.append(11)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that in this approach as well, index numbering starts at zero by default, meaning that the value 12 is stored at index position 0, the value 25 at index position 1 and so forth.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The statement ages = [] does not reserve any locations in main memory (RAM). It just states that the list ages is ready to accept new elements.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_7">30.4 How to Get Values from a One-Dimensional List</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Getting values from a list is just a matter of pointing to a specific element. Each element of a one-dimensional list can be uniquely identified using an index. The following code fragment creates a list and displays “A+” (without the double quotes) on the screen.</p>
<div><p>grades = ["B+", "A+", "A", "C-"]</p>
<p>print(grades[1])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Of course, instead of using constant values for index, you can also use variables or expressions. The following example creates a list and displays “Aphrodite and Hera” (without the double quotes) on the screen.</p>
<div><p>gods = ["Zeus", "Ares", "Hera", "Aphrodite", "Hermes"]</p>
<p>k = 2</p>
<p>print(gods[k + 1], "and", gods[k])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">A negative index accesses an element by starting to count from the end of the list. In the following list grades, the index position of each element (using negative indexes) is as follows.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width26" src="img/chapter30-09.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The following example</p>
<div><p>grades = ["B+", "A+", "A", "C-"]</p>
<p>print(grades[-1] , "and", grades[-3])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">displays “C− and A+” (without the double quotes) on the screen.</p>
<p class="my_basic">If you wish to display all the elements of a list, you can do the following</p>
<div><p>grades = ["B+", "A+", "A", "C-"]</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(grades)        #It displays: ['B+', 'A+', 'A', 'C-']</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>In Python, you can define a string using either single or double quotes.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Just like in strings, you can get a subset of a list, called a “slice”, as shown here.</p>
<div><p>grades = ["B+", "A+", "A", "C-"]</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(grades[1:3])        #It displays: ["A+", "A"]</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Slicing in Python is a mechanism to select a range of elements from a list (or from a sequence, in general).</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The slicing mechanism can also have a third argument, called step, as shown here.</p>
<div><p>grades = ["B+", "A+", "A", "C-", "A-", "B-", "C", "B", "C+"]</p>
<p>print(grades[1:7:2])        #It displays: ['A+', 'C-', 'B-']</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">A negative step returns a subset of a list in reverse order</p>
<div><p>gods = ["Ares", "Hera", "Aphrodite", "Hermes"]</p>
<p>print(gods[2:0:-1])   #It displays: ['Aphrodite', 'Hera']</p>
<p>print(gods[::-1])     #It displays: ['Hermes', 'Aphrodite', 'Hera', 'Ares']</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>The slicing mechanism uses the notation</p>
<p class="notice center">list[[beginIndex] : [endIndex] [: step]]</p>
<p class="notice">and returns a portion of list. Specifically, it returns the sublist starting from position beginIndex and running up to, but not including, position endIndex or up to the end of list, whichever comes first. Both arguments beginIndex and endIndex are optional. If beginIndex is omitted, the sublist starting from position 0 and running up to, but not including, position endIndex is returned. If endIndex is omitted, the sublist starting from position beginIndex until the end of list is returned. The last argument step is optional as well. If omitted, its default value is 1. If supplied, it defines the number of elements you want to move forward after each element is retrieved from the original list.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_8">Exercise 30.4-1 Creating the Trace Table</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Create the trace table for the next code fragment.</p>
<div><p>a = [None] * 4</p>
<div></div>
<p>a[3] = 9</p>
<p>x = 0</p>
<p>a[x] = a[3] + 4</p>
<p>a[x + 1] = a[x] * 3</p>
<p>x += 1</p>
<p>a[x + 2] = a[x - 1]</p>
<p>a[2] = a[1] + 5</p>
<p>a[3] = a[3] + 1</p>
</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Don't forget that you can manipulate each element of a list as if it were a variable. Thus, when you create a trace table for a Python program that uses lists, you can have one column for each element as follows.</p>

<p>print(grades[100])</p>

<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Two properties are not satisfied by this Python program. The first one is obvious: there is no data input. The second one is the property of definiteness. You must never reference a non-existing element of a list. In this exercise, since there is no element at index position 100, the last statement throws a runtime error.</p>
<h3 id="toc_10">30.5 How to Alter the Value of a List Element</h3>
<p class="my_basic">To alter the value of an existing list element is a piece of cake. All you need to do is use the appropriate index and assign a new value to that element. The example that follows shows exactly this.</p>
<div><p>#Create a list</p>
<p>tribes = ["Navajo", "Cherokee", "Sioux"]</p>
<p>print(tribes)    #It displays: ['Navajo', 'Cherokee', 'Sioux']</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">30.6 How to Iterate Through a One-Dimensional List</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Now comes the interesting part. A program can iterate through the elements of a list using a loop control structure (usually a for-loop). There are two approaches you can use to iterate through a one-dimensional list.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach refers to each list element using its index. Following is a code fragment, written in general form</p>
<div><p>for index in range(size):</p>
<div><p>process structure_name[index]</p></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">in which, process is any Python statement or block of statements that processes one element of the list structure_name at each iteration.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following Python program displays all elements of the list gods, one at each iteration.</p>
<div><p>gods = ["Zeus", "Ares", "Hera", "Aphrodite", "Hermes"]</p>
<p>for i in range(5):</p>
<p>print(gods[i])</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The name of the variable i is not binding. You can use any variable name you want, such as index, ind, j, and many more.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that since the list gods contains five elements, the for-loop must iterate from 0 to 4 and not from 1 to 5. This is because the indexes of the four elements are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, correspondingly.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Since lists are mutable, you can use a loop control structure to alter all or some of its values. The following code fragment doubles the values of some elements of the list b.</p>
<div><p>b = [80, 65, 60, 72, 30, 40]</p>
<p>for i in range(3):</p>
<p>b[i] = b[i] * 2</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach is very simple but not as flexible as the previous one. There are cases where it cannot be used, as you will see below. Following is a code fragment, written in general form</p>
<div><p>for element in structure_name:</p>
<div><p>process element</p></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">in which process is any Python statement or block of statements that processes one element of the list structure_name at each iteration.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following Python program, displays all elements of the list grades, one at each iteration.</p>
<div><p>grades = ["B+", "A+", "A", "C-"]</p>
<div></div>
<p>for grade in grades:</p>
<p>print(grade)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In the first iteration, the value of the first element is assigned to variable grade. In the second iteration, the value of the second element is assigned to variable grade and so on!</p>

<div><p>gods = ["Hera", "Zeus", "Ares", "Aphrodite", "Hermes"]</p>
<p>for god in gods[::-1]:</p>
<p>print(god)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Keep in mind, though, that this approach cannot be used to alter the values of the elements in a list. For example, if you want to double the values of all elements in the list numbers, you cannot do the following:</p>
<div><p>numbers = [5, 10, 3, 2]</p>
<div></div>
<p>for number in numbers:</p>
<p>number = number * 2</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>number is a simple variable where, at each iteration, each successive value of the list numbers is assigned to. However, the opposite never happens! The value of number is never assigned back to any element!</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>If you want to alter the values of the elements in a list, you should use the first approach.</p>

<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">You learned two approaches to iterate through the list elements. Let's use both approaches and see the differences. You will find an extra third approach below, which is the Pythonic way to calculate the sum of the elements of a one-dimensional list.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">The solution is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_30.6-1a</div>
<div><p>values = [56, 12, 33, 8, 3, 2, 98]</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">30.7 How to Add User-Entered Values to a One-Dimensional List</h3>
<p class="my_basic">There is nothing new here. Instead of reading a value from the keyboard and assigning that value to a variable, you can directly assign that value to a specific list element. The next code fragment prompts the user to enter the names of four people, and assigns them to the elements at index positions 0, 1, 2, and 3, of the list names.</p>
<div><p>names = [None] * 4    #Pre-reserve 4 locations in main memory (RAM)</p>
<div></div>
<p>names[0] = input("Enter name No 1: ")</p>
<p>names[1] = input("Enter name No 2: ")</p>
<p>names[2] = input("Enter name No 3: ")</p>
<p>names[3] = input("Enter name No 4: ")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Using a for-loop, this code fragment can equivalently be written as</p>
<div><p>ELEMENTS = 4</p>
<div></div>
<p>names = [None] * ELEMENTS   #Pre-reserve 4 locations in main memory (RAM)</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>names[i] = input("Enter name No " + str(i + 1)  + ": ")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">You can, of course, do the same, using the append() method instead, as shown in the code fragment that follows.</p>
<div><p>ELEMENTS = 4</p>
<div></div>
<p>names = []    #Create a totally empty list</p>
<p>for i in range(ELEMENTS):</p>
<p>name = input("Enter name No " + str(i + 1)  + ": ")</p>
<p>names.append(name)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>When the append() method is used, elements are appended to a list (added at the end of the list).</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>A very good tactic for dealing with list sizes is to use constants. However, unlike some other programming languages (such as C# or C++), Python does not inherently support constants. Instead, you can use a variable to achieve similar results. It is advisable, though, to use only uppercase letters. This helps you to visually distinguish those variables that are used as constants from regular variables.</p>

<h4 id="toc_14">Exercise 30.7-1 Displaying Words in Reverse Order</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter 20 words. The program must then display them in the exact reverse of the order in which they were provided.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Lists are perfect for problems like this one. The following is an appropriate solution.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_30.7-1a</div>

<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Since index numbering starts at zero, the index of the last list element is 1 less than the total number of elements in the list.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Keep in mind that in Python you can iterate in reverse order through the list elements using the slicing mechanism and a value of −1 for step. The following program creates a totally empty list and then uses the append() method to add elements to the list. Finally, the slicing mechanism is used to display them in the exact reverse of the order in which they were provided.</p>

<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Sometimes the wording of an exercise may say nothing about using a data structure. However, this doesn't mean that you can't use one. Use data structures (lists, tuples,  dictionaries etc.) whenever you find them necessary.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>A “tuple” is almost identical to a list. The main difference is that tuples are immutable (unchangeable).</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>An “immutable” data structure is a structure in which the value of its elements cannot be changed once the data structure is created. Obviously, you cannot add new elements to an immutable data structure or remove existing elements from it.</p>

<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, the program must accept all values from the user and store them into a list. However, within the for-loop that is responsible for displaying the list elements, a nested decision control structure must check for and display only the positive values.

<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">To find the average value of the user-provided numbers the program must first find their sum and then divide that sum by 20. Once the average value is found, the program must check whether to display the corresponding message.</p>

<p class="my_basic">But let's clarify something! Even though many processes can be performed inside just one for-loop, it is simpler to carry out each individual process in a separate for-loop. This is probably not so efficient but, since you are still a novice programmer, try to adopt this programming style just for now. Later, when you have the experience and become a Python guru, you will be able to “merge” many processes in just one for-loop!</p>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's see a more Pythonic approach using the fsum() function.</p>

<h3 id="toc_20">30.8 More about the Concatenation and Repetition Operators</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In <a href="chapter07.html#toc_7">Section 7.5</a>, you learned how to concatenate and how to repeat strings using the string operators ( + ) and ( * ) correspondingly. The same operators, as well as their corresponding assignment operators ( += ) and ( *= ), can also be used in lists. To be more specific, the concatenation operator ( + ) and the concatenation assignment operator ( += ) can be used to join two (or more) lists, whereas the repetition operator ( * ) and the repetition assignment operator ( *= ) can be used to repeat the same list multiple times. Let's see some examples.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following code fragment creates list x, which, in the end, contains the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].</p>
<div><p>a = [1, 2]</p>
<p>b = [3, 4]</p>
<p>x = a + b    #List x contains the values [1, 2, 3, 4]</p>
<p>x += [5, 6]  #List x contains the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">You have already used the repetition operator ( * ) in <a href="#toc_6">Section 30.3</a> to create a list with empty elements using the following statement given in general form:</p>
<div><p>list_name = [None] * size</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">What this statement actually did was to repeat a list of one empty element (this is the [None] list) size times. For example, the following code fragment iterates the list [None] 3 times.</p>
<div><p>x = [None] * 3   #List x contains the values [None, None, None]</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The following code fragment creates list x, which, in the end, contains the values [5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6].</p>

<h3 id="toc_21">30.9 What is a Dictionary?</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In computer science, the main difference between a dictionary and a list is that the dictionary elements can be uniquely identified using a key and not necessarily an integer value. Each key of a dictionary is associated (or mapped, if you prefer) to an element. The keys of a dictionary can be of type string, integer, float, or tuple.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following example presents a dictionary that holds the names of a family. The name of the dictionary is family and the corresponding keys are written above each element.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width35" src="img/chapter30-10.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The keys of dictionary elements must be unique within the dictionary. This means that in the dictionary family, for example, you cannot have two keys named father.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The values of dictionary elements can be of any type.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toc_22">30.10 Creating Dictionaries in Python</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Let's try to create the following dictionary using the most common approaches.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width30" src="img/chapter30-11.png"/></p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">To create a dictionary and directly assign values to its elements, you can use the next Python statement, given in general form.</p>
<div><p>dict_name = {key0: value0, key1: value1, key2: value2, …, keyM: valueM }</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">where</p>
<p>►dict_name is the name of the dictionary.</p>
<p>►key0, key1, key2, … , keyM are the keys of the dictionary elements.</p>
<p>►value0, value1, value2, … , valueM are the values of the dictionary elements.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Using this approach, the dictionary pupil can be created using the following statement:</p>
<div><p>pupil = {"firstName": "Ann", "lastName": "Fox", "age": 8, "class": "2nd"}</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Each key is separated from its value by a colon ( : ), the elements are separated by commas, and everything is enclosed within curly brackets { }.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>In <a href="chapter05.html#toc_4">Section 5.4</a> you learned about the rules that must be followed when assigning names to variables. Assigning names to dictionaries follows exactly the same rules!</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, you can create a totally empty dictionary using the following statement, given in general form</p>
<div><p>dict_name = {}</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">and then add an element (key-value), as shown in the following Python statement, given in general form.</p>
<div><p>dict_name[key] = value</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Using this approach, the dictionary pupil can be created using the following code fragment:</p>
<div><p>pupil = {}</p>

<h4 id="toc_25">Exercise 30.11-2 Using a Non-Existing Key in Dictionaries</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">What is wrong in the following Python program?</p>
<div><p>family = {"father": "John", "mother": "Maria", "son": "George"}</p>
<p>print(family["daughter"])</p>
</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Similar to lists, this code does not satisfy the property of definiteness. You must never reference a non-existing dictionary element. Since there is no key “daughter”, the last statement throws a runtime error.</p>
<h3 id="toc_26">30.12 How to Alter the Value of a Dictionary Element</h3>
<p class="my_basic">To alter the value of an existing dictionary element you need to use the appropriate key and assign a new value to that element. The example that follows shows exactly this.</p>
<div><p>#Create a dictionary</p>
<p>tribes = {"Indian": "Navajo", "African": "Zulu"}</p>
<p>print(tribes) #It displays: {'Indian': 'Navajo', 'African': 'Zulu'}</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Alter the value of an existing element</p>
<p>tribes["Indian"] = "Apache"</p>
<p>print(tribes) #It displays: {'Indian': 'Apache', 'African': 'Zulu'}</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_27">Exercise 30.12-1 Assigning a Value to a Non-Existing Key</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Is there anything wrong in the following code fragment?</p>
<div><p>tribes = {0: "Navajo", 1: "Cherokee", 2: "Sioux"}</p>
<p>tribes[3] = "Apache"</p>
</div>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">No, this time there is absolutely nothing wrong in this code fragment. At first glance, you might have thought that the last statement tries to alter the value of a non-existing key and it will throw an error. This is not true for Python's dictionaries, though. Since tribes is a dictionary and key “3” does not exist, the last statement adds a brand new fourth element to the dictionary!</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>The keys of a dictionary can be of type string, integer, float, or tuple.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Keep in mind though, if tribes were actually a list, the last statement would certainly throw an error. Take a look at the following code fragment</p>
<div><p>tribes = ["Navajo", "Cherokee", "Sioux"]</p>
<p>tribes[3] = "Apache"</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In this example, since tribes is a list and index 3 does not exist, the last statement tries to alter the value of a non-existing element and obviously throws an error!</p>
<h3 id="toc_28">30.13 How to Iterate Through a Dictionary</h3>
<p class="my_basic">To iterate through the elements of a dictionary you can use a for-loop. There are two approaches actually. Let's study them both!</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">Following is a code fragment, written in general form</p>
<div><p>for key in structure_name:</p>
<div><p>process structure_name[key]</p></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">in which process is any Python statement or block of statements that processes one element of the dictionary structure_name at each iteration.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following Python program displays the letters A, B, C, and D, and their corresponding Morse<sup><a href="footnotes.html#Endnote_23" id="Link_To_Endnote_23">[23]</a></sup> code.</p>
<div><p>morseCode = {"A": ".-", "B": "-...", "C": "-.-.", "D": "-.."}</p>
<div></div>
<p>for letter in morseCode:</p>
<p>print(letter, morseCode[letter])</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The next example gives a bonus of $2000 to each employee of a computer software company!</p>
<div><p>salaries = {</p>
<div><p>"Project Manager": 83000,</p></div>
<div><p>"Software Engineer": 81000,</p></div>
<div><p>"Network Engineer": 64000,</p></div>
<div><p>"Systems Administrator": 61000,</p></div>
<div><p>"Software Developer": 70000</p></div>
<p>}</div>
<div></p>
<p>for title in salaries:</p>
<p>salaries[title] += 2000</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">Following is a code fragment, written in general form</p>
<div><p>for key, value in structure_name.items():</p>
<div><p>process key, value</p></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">in which process is any Python statement or block of statements that processes one element of the dictionary structure_name at each iteration.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following Python program displays all elements of the dictionary grades, one at each iteration.</p>
<div><p>grades = {"John": "B+", "George": "A+", "Maria": "A", "Helen": "A-"}</p>
<div></div>
<p>for name, grade in grades.items():</p>
<p>print(name, "got", grade)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Unfortunately, this approach cannot be used to alter the values of the elements of a dictionary. For example, if you want to double the values of all elements of the dictionary salaries, you cannot do the following:</p>
<div><p>salaries = {</p>
<div><p>"Project Manager": 83000,</p></div>
<div><p>"Software Engineer": 81000,</p></div>
<div><p>"Network Engineer": 64000,</p></div>
<div><p>"Systems Administrator": 61000,</p></div>
<div><p>"Software Developer": 70000</p></div>
<p>}</div>
<div></p>
<p>for title, salary in salaries.items():</p>
<p>salary *= 2</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>salary is a simple variable that, at each iteration, each successive value of the dictionary salaries is assigned to. However, the opposite never happens! The value of salary is never assigned back to any element!</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>If you want to alter the values of the elements of a dictionary, you should use the first approach.</p>

<h3 id="toc_29">30.14 More about the Membership Operators</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In <a href="chapter15.html#toc_7">Section 15.5</a>, you learned about Python's membership operators in and not in. You can, as well, use the same operators to evaluate whether or not an operand exists in a specified data structure. Let's see some examples.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The following example displays “It exists!”</p>
<div><p>x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p>
<p>if 3 in x:</p>
<p>print("It exists!")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The following example looks for “George” in list y.</p>
<div><p>y = ["John", "Maria", "Anna", "George", "Tes"]</p>
<p>if "George" in y:</p>
<p>print("I found George!!!!")</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that the in operator checks whether an operand exists in a data structure. It cannot find the index position where the operand is found!</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The following example prompts the user to enter a name and then checks whether it does not exist in the list y.</p>
<div><p>y = ["John", "Maria", "Anna", "George", "Tes"]</p>
<p>name = input("Enter a name to search: ")</p>
<p>if name not in y:</p>
<p>print(name, "not found!!!!")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The following example checks whether key “Son” exists in dictionary family.</p>
<div><p>family = {"Father": "John", "Mother": "Maria", "Son": "George"}</p>
<div></div>

<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">Each Roman numeral is a combination of tens and ones digits. For example, the Roman numeral representation of the number 45 is XLV (4 tens represented by XL and 5 ones represented by V). Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter an integer between 1 and 99 and displays the corresponding Roman numeral. Assume that the user enters a valid value.</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">Hint: Avoid checking each integer individually, as this would require a multiple-alternative decision structure with 99 cases. Try to find a more efficient and clever approach instead!</p>

<p><em class="italic">FastAPI Cookbook</em> is a vital resource for Python developers who want to master the FastAPI framework to build APIs. Created by Sebastián Ramírez Montaño, FastAPI was first released in December 2018. It quickly gained popularity and became one of the most widely used Python frameworks for building APIs.</p>
<p>The book starts by introducing FastAPI, showing its advantages, and it will help you set up your development environment. It then moves on to data handling, showing database integration and <strong class="bold">create, read, update and delete</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRUD</strong>) operations, to help you manage data effectively within your APIs.</p>
<p>As the book progresses, it explores how to create <strong class="bold">RESTfu</strong>l APIs, covering advanced topics such as complex queries, versioning, and extensive documentation. Security is also important, and the book has a chapter on implementing authentication mechanisms such as <strong class="bold">OAuth2</strong> and <strong class="bold">JWT </strong>tokens to secure FastAPI applications.</p>
<p>Testing is an essential part of development, and the book offers strategies to ensure the quality and reliability of FastAPI applications. Deployment strategies are discussed, highlighting best practices for production environments. For applications with high traffic, the book examines scaling techniques to improve performance.</p>
<p>Extending FastAPI’s functionality is possible through middleware, and the book also demonstrates how to boost FastAPI’s capabilities by integrating it with other Python tools and frameworks to accommodate machine learning models and expose <strong class="bold">LLM </strong><strong class="bold">RAG</strong> applications.</p>
<p>Real-time communication is handled with a chapter on <strong class="bold">WebSockets</strong>, and advanced data handling techniques are provided to manage large datasets and file management.</p>
<p>The book ends with a focus on serving real-world traffic with FastAPI, stressing deployment strategies and packaging shipping. Each chapter is carefully designed to build your expertise, making the <em class="italic">FastAPI Cookbook</em> a valuable guide for professional-grade API development.</p>

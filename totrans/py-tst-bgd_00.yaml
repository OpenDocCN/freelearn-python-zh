  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like any programmer, you need to be able to produce reliable code that conforms
    to a specification, which means that you need to test your code. In this book,
    you'll learn how to use techniques and Python tools that reduce the effort involved
    in testing, and at the same time make it more useful—and even fun.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll learn about several of Python's automated testing tools, and you'll learn
    about the philosophies and methodologies that they were designed to support, like
    unit testing and test-driven development. When you're done, you'll be able to
    produce thoroughly tested code faster and more easily than ever before, and you'll
    be able to do it in a way that doesn't distract you from your "real" programming.

    of the 2.6 version series. You'll also need a source code editor, and occasional
    access to the internet. You will need to be comfortable enough using your operating
    system's textual interface—your DOS prompt or command shell—to do basic directory
    management and to run programs.

  zh: 前言
- en: In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), it has become very important to
    rapidly develop and test prototypes of your hardware products while also augmenting
    them using software features. The Arduino movement has been the front-runner in
    this hardware revolution, and through its simple board designs it has made it
    convenient for anyone to develop DIY hardware projects. The great amount of support
    that is available through the open source community has made the difficulties
    that are associated with the development of a hardware prototype a thing of the
    past. On the software front, Python has been the crown jewel of the open source
    software community for a significant amount of time. Python is supported by a
    huge amount of libraries to develop various features, such as graphical user interfaces,
    plots, messaging, and cloud applications.

  zh: 在物联网（IoT）时代，快速开发和测试你的硬件产品的原型，同时使用软件特性对其进行增强，变得非常重要。Arduino运动在这一硬件革命中一直处于领先地位，通过其简单的板设计，它使任何人都能方便地开发DIY硬件项目。开源社区提供的巨大支持使得与硬件原型开发相关的困难已成为过去。在软件方面，Python已经很长时间一直是开源软件社区的瑰宝。Python拥有大量的库来开发各种特性，如图形用户界面、图表、消息和云应用。
- en: This book tries to bring you the best of both hardware and software worlds to
    help you develop exciting projects using Arduino and Python. The main goal of
    the book is to assist the reader to solve the difficult problem of interfacing
    Arduino hardware with Python libraries. Meanwhile, as a secondary goal, the book
    also provides you with exercises and projects that can be used as blueprints for
    your future IoT projects.

  zh: 本书旨在将硬件和软件世界的最佳结合带给您，帮助您使用Arduino和Python开发令人兴奋的项目。本书的主要目标是帮助读者解决将Arduino硬件与Python库接口的难题。同时，作为次要目标，本书还提供了可以用于您未来物联网项目的练习和项目。
- en: The book has been designed in such a way that every successive chapter has increasing
    complexity in terms of material that is covered and also more practical value.
    The book has three conceptual sections (getting started, implementing Python features,
    and network connectivity) and each section concludes with a practical project
    that integrates the concepts that you learned in that section.

  zh: 本书的设计方式是，每一章在涵盖的材料复杂性和实用性方面都有所增加。本书分为三个概念部分（入门、实现Python特性、网络连接），每个部分都以一个实际项目结束，该项目整合了你在该部分学到的概念。
- en: The theoretical concepts and exercises covered in the book are meant to give
    you hands-on experience with Python-Arduino programming, while the projects are
    designed to teach you hardware prototyping methodologies for your future projects.
    However, you will still need extensive expertise in each domain to develop a commercial
    product. In the end, I hope to provide you with sufficient knowledge to jump-start
    your journey in this novel domain of the IoT.

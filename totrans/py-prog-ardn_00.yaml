- en: In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), it has become very important to
    rapidly develop and test prototypes of your hardware products while also augmenting
    them using software features. The Arduino movement has been the front-runner in
    this hardware revolution, and through its simple board designs it has made it
    convenient for anyone to develop DIY hardware projects. The great amount of support
    that is available through the open source community has made the difficulties
    that are associated with the development of a hardware prototype a thing of the
    past. On the software front, Python has been the crown jewel of the open source
    software community for a significant amount of time. Python is supported by a
    huge amount of libraries to develop various features, such as graphical user interfaces,
    plots, messaging, and cloud applications.

- en: This book tries to bring you the best of both hardware and software worlds to
    help you develop exciting projects using Arduino and Python. The main goal of
    the book is to assist the reader to solve the difficult problem of interfacing
    Arduino hardware with Python libraries. Meanwhile, as a secondary goal, the book
    also provides you with exercises and projects that can be used as blueprints for
    your future IoT projects.

- en: The book has been designed in such a way that every successive chapter has increasing
    complexity in terms of material that is covered and also more practical value.
    The book has three conceptual sections (getting started, implementing Python features,
    and network connectivity) and each section concludes with a practical project
    that integrates the concepts that you learned in that section.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The theoretical concepts and exercises covered in the book are meant to give
    you hands-on experience with Python-Arduino programming, while the projects are
    designed to teach you hardware prototyping methodologies for your future projects.
    However, you will still need extensive expertise in each domain to develop a commercial
    product. In the end, I hope to provide you with sufficient knowledge to jump-start
    your journey in this novel domain of the IoT.

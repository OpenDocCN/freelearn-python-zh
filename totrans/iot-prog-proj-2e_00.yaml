- en: '*Internet of Things Programming Projects* is a comprehensive hands-on guide,
    designed to walk you through a series of progressively advanced **Internet of
    Things** (**IoT**) projects using Raspberry Pi and associated peripherals.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the initial stages, you will be introduced to the foundational concepts and
    components surrounding the Raspberry Pi, including a detailed exploration of various
    models, accessories such as hardware attached on top (HAT), and compatible operating
    systems. You will begin your journey into IoT by engaging in projects that demonstrate
    the Raspberry Pi’s capacity to interface with real-time data and control physical
    devices, setting the stage for more advanced undertakings.

- en: As you proceed, you will immerse yourself in the development of web services
    and IoT applications, creating real-time data displays and innovative solutions
    such as a weather indicator application. These applications not only provide Python
    programming and data acquisition skills but also venture into the physical world,
    utilizing hardware components to create tangible outcomes.

- en: In the middle portion of the book, emphasis is laid on building a home security
    system from scratch. You will learn about the general-purpose input/output (GPIO)
    pins of the Raspberry Pi, sensor integrations, and hands-on alarm system development,
    using protocols such as message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT). A pivotal
    point will be reached when we create an MQTT-based standalone IoT alarm module
    and its associated peripherals.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Toward the latter part of the journey, the narrative progresses to more advanced
    and autonomous IoT projects. You will construct a LoRa-enabled IoT monitoring
    station capable of measuring various environmental factors, including air quality.
    This station, powered by a battery, communicates data through LoRa to a LoRaWAN
    network, illustrating the integration of IoT devices with wider network infrastructures
    and emphasizing sustainable, battery-operated solutions.

- en: Culminating the series of projects is the creation of an IoT robot car, leveraging
    the Robot Operating System (ROS). This advanced endeavor guides you in building
    a robot car equipped to send sensory information over the internet through MQTT,
    facilitating remote control via a web browser or other applications. This project
    represents a pinnacle of IoT mastery, incorporating robotics, network communications,
    and remote control functionalities into a unified system.

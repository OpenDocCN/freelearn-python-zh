    Anyone can prop up some studs and build a garden shed, but a house or skyscraper
    takes careful planning and engineering. Software is no different; simple scripts
    can get away with shortcuts such as global variables or manipulating class properties
    directly, but as the program grows, our code needs to isolate and encapsulate
    different functionalities in a way that limits the amount of complexity we need
    to understand at any given moment.

    but also the various ways data can be queried or manipulated. Ideally, the model
    is not concerned with or affected by how the data will be presented (that is,
    what GUI widgets will be used, how the fields will be ordered, and so on), but
    rather presents a high-level interface that only minimally concerns other components
    with its inner workings. In theory, if you decided to completely change the user
    interface of the program (say, from a Tkinter application to a web application),
    the model should be totally unaffected.

    access to the model; if they do, they generally have read-only access, sending
    write requests through the controller.

    before handing it off to the model, but `_vars` shouldn''t be defining our data
    record from here on out — that''s the model''s job. To implement MVC, we''ll need

    requests from the user and takes care of routing data between the views and the
    model. Most variations of MVC change the role (and sometimes the name) of the
    controller, but the important thing is that it acts as the intermediary between
    the view and the model. Our controller object will need to hold references to
    the views and models used by our application and be responsible for managing interactions
    between them.

    though it has some view and model logic in it as well. Unfortunately, the `Tk`
    object in Tkinter combines both the central point of control and the `root` window,
    so it's not entirely possible to separate the controller from the application's
    main view. Our `Application` object will therefore contain a little of both, but
    in the interest of implementing a more MVC design, we'll need to move some of
    its presentation logic into the views and some of its data logic into the models.
    Ideally, though, we want the `Application` object focused mainly on connecting
    code between the models and views.

    write more code to do exactly the same thing. Why would we do this?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Put simply, we're doing it to make expansion manageable. As the application
    grows, the complexity will also grow. Isolating our components from one another
    limits the amount of complexity that any one component has to manage; for example,
    if we wanted to restructure the layout of the Data Record Form, we should not
    have to worry if doing so will change the structure of the data in the output
    file.

- en: The bottom line is, without some guiding architectural strategy, our program
    is in danger of becoming a hopeless tangle of spaghetti logic. Even without adhering

    the logical complexity of each component, physically breaking the code into multiple
    files helps us keep the complexity of each file manageable. It also reinforces
    more isolation between components; for example, you can't share global variables
    between files, and you know that if your `models.py` file imports `tkinter`, you're
    doing something wrong.

    Notice it's in lowercase. This is going to be a Python package that will contain
    all the code for the application; it should always be given a fairly unique and
    descriptive name so that it won't be confused with existing Python packages. Normally,
    you wouldn't have a different casing between the application root and this main
    module, but it doesn't hurt anything either; we're doing it here to avoid confusion.

    widget inside a `Notebook` or `Frame` widget, rather than directly under the `Application`

    this, create a file in your project root called `.gitignore` and put the following

    files, Git allows you to stage as many files as you wish to be part of a single
    commit. Note that we can specify directories rather than individual files; in
    this case, all the files currently inside the directory will be staged for our
    next commit.

    reset** the state of the repository to the last commit. If you don't want to reset
    your repository, you can also use `git checkout` to switch to an old commit temporarily,
    or use `git branch` to create a new branch using a particular commit as the base.
    As you can see already, this gives us a powerful safety net for experimentation;
    no matter how much you tinker with the code, any commit is just a command away!

    where you can learn about advanced features like branching and setting up remote
    repositories. For now, the important thing is to commit changes as you go, so
    that you maintain your safety net and document the history of changes.

- en: In this chapter, you learned to prepare your simple script for some serious
    expansion. You learned how to divide your application's areas of responsibility
    into separate components using the model-view-controller model. You reimplemented
    the ABQ application as a Python package, splitting the code into multiple modules
    to further enforce separation of concerns and provide an organized framework for
    later expansion. Finally, you set up a Git repository for your code so that you
    can track all your changes with version control.

    a main menu. You'll also learn how to provide configurable settings for your application
    and save them to disk.

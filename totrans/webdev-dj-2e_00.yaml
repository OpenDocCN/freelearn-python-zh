- en: Do you want to develop reliable and secure applications that stand out from
    the crowd, rather than spending hours on boilerplate code? If so, the Django framework
    is where you should begin. Often referred to as a "batteries included" web development
    framework, Django comes with all the core features needed to build a standalone
    application.

    knowledge and confidence to build real-world applications using Python.'

- en: Starting with the essential concepts of Django, you'll cover its major features
    by building a website called Bookr – a repository for book reviews. This end-to-end
    case study is split into a series of bitesize projects that are presented as exercises
    and activities, allowing you to challenge yourself in an enjoyable and attainable
    way.

    static files to add CSS, JavaScript, and images to your application, how to implement
    forms to accept user input, and how to manage sessions to ensure a reliable user
    experience. Throughout this book, you'll cover key daily tasks that are part of
    the development cycle of a real-world web application.

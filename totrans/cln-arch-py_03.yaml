    how it separates concerns into distinct layers, from core business logic to external
    interfaces, promoting independence and testability. Now, we’ll dive deeper into

    Over-applying SRP can lead to an explosion of tiny classes and functions, which

    SRP *as a class or module that should do only one thing* can lead to the creation
    of too many tiny classes. The principle is about single reasons to change, not

    code more maintainable and understandable. If splitting a class or function makes

    states that source code dependencies should only point inwards, with inner circles
    containing high-level policies and outer circles containing implementation details.
    DIP offers a concrete strategy for adhering to this rule, allowing us to structure
    our code so that high-level modules are independent of low-level modules. Let’s

    Python systems that truly embody the principles of Clean Architecture and respect

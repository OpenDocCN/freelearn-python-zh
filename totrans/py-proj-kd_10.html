In the final chapter of this book, we will review all that you learned from the beginning of this journey, and then explore some other ideas that you can try with your new coding skills. Many of these ideas will be games, but some ideas will involve other ways in which Python can be used.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec79"/>What we learned and your next steps</h1></div></div></div><p>At the beginning of this book, you started out by learning about your computer. You learned how to install Python and use different free tools such as text editors, the Python shell, and a terminal/command line to run your games. Also, you learned how to navigate to your desktop directory and save your work so that you could work through each project. The next steps included the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Navigating to other folders and directories on your computer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learning more terminal/command prompt commands</li></ul></div><p>We then started our coding journey by making functions and variables, and using different data types. We created some functions to do mathematics, and then we put those functions together to create a calculator. You learned how to get information from someone by giving them a prompt using the <code class="literal">input()</code> command.</p><p>We used logic such as <code class="literal">if</code> and <code class="literal">else</code> to teach the computer how to make decisions based on what the user decided to do. We also used loops to help us perform different jobs in games. The steps after this would include the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Looking up and trying to understand nested <code class="literal">if</code> statements</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using loops to work with large text or datasets</li></ul></div><p>You learned about the different ways to use and store data in Python, such as dictionaries and lists. It is helpful to know how things are stored in Python, and one of the fastest features of Python is its capacity to store and retrieve data very quickly.</p><p>Throughout <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Welcome! Let's Get Started">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Welcome! Let's Get Started</em>, and <a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Tiny Tennis">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Tiny Tennis</em>, we built several projects to show how you could use the skills that you learned. It is important to understand how to use the great features of Python to solve problems. Knowing about each tool means that you can better imagine how to solve a problem using your coding skills. For the remainder of the chapter, let's take a look at some of the problems we can solve that will expand our Python skills.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec80"/>Classes and objects – very important next steps!</h1></div></div></div><p>Immediately, you <a id="id364" class="indexterm"/>will need to start learning about classes and objects. These are great ways to simplify what would otherwise be repeated code. For example, there is a class in pygame called <code class="literal">Sprites</code>. The <code class="literal">pygame.Sprites</code> module has classes that make it easier to manage different game objects.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note23"/>Note</h3><p>To learn more <a id="id365" class="indexterm"/>about Sprites, it is best to refer to the documentation:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/SpriteIntro.html">http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/SpriteIntro.html</a>.</p></div></div><p>To learn <a id="id366" class="indexterm"/>more about classes and objects, it is a good idea to search the Internet for things such as object-oriented programming (this is the kind of programming that Python uses) and, more specifically, classes and objects. If you find classes and objects confusing, do not worry. This is a concept that takes some getting used to.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note24"/>Note</h3><p>Here are some resources that will help you learn about classes and objects:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm</a></p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects">http://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects</a></p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec81"/>More fun with games</h1></div></div></div><p>Since the focus <a id="id367" class="indexterm"/>of this book was making game projects, we shall take a look at some more complicated things that you can do with games once you explore pygame in more detail. You can start by making Tiny Tennis more complicated in these ways:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding a music file</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding graphics</li></ul></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec82"/>Adding music to games</h1></div></div></div><p>pygame allows<a id="id368" class="indexterm"/> you to add music to your games. There is a music module that allows you to add music in a few formats to your game files. There are some <a id="id369" class="indexterm"/>limitations, including file types. For example, using universally supported <code class="literal">.ogg</code> file types is better than using file types such as <code class="literal">.mp3</code>, which are not natively supported on all operating systems.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note25"/>Note</h3><p>For more information, you can go to the pygame site at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html">https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html</a> and learn how to add your favorite sounds.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec83"/>Adding graphics to games</h1></div></div></div><p>While <a id="id370" class="indexterm"/>you learned how to make some basic shapes, our world would be pretty boring if it only had rectangles, circles, and squares in basic colors. By experimenting with modules such as the <code class="literal">pygame.image()</code> module you can learn how to work with images that are created outside of pygame. If you have an artistic sibling or friend or you are an artist yourself, you can create or scan artwork in your computer and then add it to your games.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"/>Note</h3><p>You can learn about the <code class="literal">pygame.image()</code> module at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/image.html">http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/image.html</a>.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec84"/>Remake or design games</h1></div></div></div><p>If you <a id="id371" class="indexterm"/>want a brand new challenge, you can try remaking a classic game on your own. There are a lot of classic games, such as PacMan, Asteroids, or Legend of Zelda. A good <a id="id372" class="indexterm"/>challenge would be to try and remake a version of these games using your skills. This practice exercise would require you to do some of these important things:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Plan your program ahead of time</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Figure out if you need classes in your program</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Figure out how to use objects in your program</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Manage loops in your program</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Manage <code class="literal">if</code>/<code class="literal">else</code> decisions in your program</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Manage user information, such as the name and score, in your program</li></ul></div><p>Once you <a id="id373" class="indexterm"/>make a few games that are based on classic games, you might have<a id="id374" class="indexterm"/> some ideas for your own games. If you do have ideas, make notes of them in a file on your computer. When you think about a new game, you need to do the same things that you do to recreate a classic game, except that you need to make other decisions about the purpose of the game, the win conditions of the game, and the controllers.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec85"/>Other games</h1></div></div></div><p>Many programmers <a id="id375" class="indexterm"/>have made small games in Python to practice their programming skills. To start with, you can look at some other games that people have made and posted on the pygame website. Navigate to <a class="ulink" href="http://pygame.org/tags/pygame">http://pygame.org/tags/pygame</a>, and view some of the contributions people have made.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec76"/>PB-Ball</h2></div></div></div><p>PB-Ball is a<a id="id376" class="indexterm"/> basketball game that uses pygame and adds classes and objects. When you navigate to the project page, you will see a few different links to the code. The following links will help you find the game and look at the code. When you look at the code, you will notice that there are folders for images and sounds. So, there are many new skills to learn in order to create a game that has a more complicated background. Here is a screenshot along with some links to the game so that you can look at the code and learn it:</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"/>Note</h3><p>Here's the link to the PB-Ball game:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://pygame.org/project-PB-Ball-2963-.html">http://pygame.org/project-PB-Ball-2963-.html</a></p><p>Here is a link to the main code, including two classes and source:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org/tjohnson2/pb-ball/src/88e324263a63eb97d6a2427f7ea719df85010dfe/main.py?fileviewer=file-view-default">https://bitbucket.org/tjohnson2/pb-ball/src/88e324263a63eb97d6a2427f7ea719df85010dfe/main.py?fileviewer=file-view-default</a></p><p>Here are some files that include images and sounds needed to play the game:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org/tjohnson2/pb-ball/src">https://bitbucket.org/tjohnson2/pb-ball/src</a></p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec77"/>Snake</h2></div></div></div><p>A <a id="id377" class="indexterm"/>game that many people have played is the snake game, where the player starts as a short snake that becomes longer as the game goes on. The only rule to stay alive is that the snake cannot touch its tail. There are many samples of this game available on the Internet. You can view a few samples of code and check whether you are able to recreate the game.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"/>Note</h3><p>Learn more about the Snake games from the following links:</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/f.php?file=snake.py">http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/f.php?file=snake.py</a></p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/YesIndeed/SnakesForPython">https://github.com/YesIndeed/SnakesForPython</a></p><p><a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/xtur/SnakesAllAround">https://github.com/xtur/SnakesAllAround</a> (this is multiplayer!)</p></div></div><p>Apart from the <a id="id378" class="indexterm"/>preceding games, there are a few programmers who have worked really hard to make Python game instructions available to new programmers! A few such books are available for free on the Internet.

Its operating system, which is different from Windows and Mac, comes preinstalled with Python and pygame, so it is a very convenient way to get started with gaming since you do not have to do all the work that we did in the first chapter.</p><p>To use <a id="id391" class="indexterm"/>Raspberry Pi, you will need a power source, a monitor that has an HDMI input, an HDMI cable, a keyboard and mouse, and a Wi-Fi dongle or Ethernet cable if you plan to use the Internet. Additionally, you will need an SD card to install the latest Raspberry Pi operating system. With these items, you can use Raspberry Pi as your primary computer and experiment, knowing that if you crash your computer, you can just make another copy of the operating system for free!</p><p>Many people have used Raspberry Pi to make games and even small, handheld game systems! Aside from making games, people have used Raspberry Pi to make robotics projects and media center projects. Something that's very neat about Raspberry Pi is that you can learn more about building computers, and you can try making computers for different uses. You can use Python and Raspberry Pi to write code that controls light switches, door buzzers, and even household appliances! You can visit the official Raspberry Pi website to learn more about its hardware and its Linux-based operating system.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note32"/>Note</h3><p>Visit <a class="ulink" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/</a> and read <em>Learning Raspberry Pi</em> by <a id="id392" class="indexterm"/>Samarth Shah (<em>Packt Publishing</em>, 2015) and <em>Raspberry Pi Cookbook for Python Programmers</em> by Tim Cox (<em>Packt Publishing</em>, April 2014) for more details about Raspberry Pi.</p></div></div><div><img src="img/B04681_10_04.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec87"/>Coding challenges</h1></div></div></div><p>Aside from all of the neat things that you can do with Python code, you can practice coding Python by finding coding challenges and completing them alone or with friends. These challenges<a id="id393" class="indexterm"/> range from being short to long, easy to difficult, and are a great way to keep your skills sharp between projects. The coding challenges usually aim at one specific coding skill each, as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Printing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Iterating over loops</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating variables, strings, and integers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Data management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Functions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">if</code>/<code class="literal">elif</code>/<code class="literal">else</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Nested <code class="literal">if</code>/<code class="literal">elif</code>/<code class="literal">else</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Nested logic</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Recursing</li></ul></div><p>If you <a id="id394" class="indexterm"/>don't feel totally comfortable with these terms, look them up, read more about them, and try some of the coding challenges to strengthen your skills. Here are <a id="id395" class="indexterm"/>some websites that have coding challenges in Python:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://codingbat.com/python">http://codingbat.com/python</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/">http://www.pythonchallenge.com/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://usingpython.com/python-programming-challenges/">http://usingpython.com/python-programming-challenges/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/ProblemSets">https://wiki.python.org/moin/ProblemSets</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/login">https://www.hackerrank.com/login</a></li></ul></div><p>You can find hundreds of practice problems in these links!</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec88"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Hopefully, this book has provided you a solid introduction to basic Python concepts. By no means are you an expert as Python is a powerful language that can do a lot more than can be presented in one book. However, if you worked through each of the games, you will have a solid Python foundation on which to build your next steps.</p><p>One way to keep using Python is to continue to work on challenges and games while digging into code architecture, classes and objects, and more advanced game coding using objects, custom images, sounds, and other effects. Python is not used in traditional game systems, but game design concepts work well in any object-oriented language. Once you are comfortable in Python, you can move toward more common game design languages, such as C++, with a lot more ease.</p><p>Another way to use Python is to learn more about data applications and how to use Python to work with different kinds of data and mathematics. This is a really great way to get further into exploring Python and also create a portfolio of work to show upper schools or even colleges. The Internet has large datasets about a variety of topics, including population and weather, among other things.</p><p>Finally, you may decide that you want to learn about web applications that are built using Python. If you choose to do so, you can look at places such as GitHub or Bitbucket where programmers keep their code and sometimes allow it to be available for free. Reading the code of other programmers is a fantastic way to learn new and interesting ways to use code. Also, finding and helping build free programs, also called open source, is a great way to help the community get better at programming. You can ask great questions and get answers to them, too.</p><p>All the best in your quest to write better games and better code. Keep learning!</p></div></body></html>

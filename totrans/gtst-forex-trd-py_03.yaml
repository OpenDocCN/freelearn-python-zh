    a lot of free stuff associated with this market, such as market data, trading
    software, and various third-party solutions. However, the quality of freely available
    solutions is frequently so low that it’s in fact not possible to use them for
    any serious trading.

    Historically, FX was an interbank market with no dedicated center. So, trading
    venues offer not only different trading platforms but also different market data,
    different types of orders, and different access to liquidity. This fragmentation
    may be quite confusing, so it’s essential to obtain a sufficient level of understanding
    in order to avoid making mistakes, which at times can be quite painful.

    discover some important – and overlooked – features that may be critical for the
    overall success of any project in FX algo trading. We will start with the organization
    of this market and see the obstacles it creates for the developer. We will learn
    about the essential types of market participants, why the price moves at all,
    and whether a particular movement is something we can make money with. We will
    also consider various ways to access this market, their pros and cons for various
    practical trading applications, and estimate how expensive it may be.

    the marketplace cannot physically accommodate all those willing to trade. So,
    traders soon became elite with unlimited access to liquidity and began acting
    on behalf of others for a commission. Of course, such a privileged position asked
    for misbehavior and many traders could not resist the temptation to trade against
    their clients, thus doubling their profits – which in turn caused changes in regulations
    and severe punishments. Although very interesting, this is another story.'

    of last traded prices.

    Such an action would swipe the entire order book by moving the last trade price
    very far from the previous readings in a moment and even worse – leaving one side
    of the order book totally empty. Of course, this is a scenario that all market
    participants and the exchange itself would like to avoid.

    the arbitrary pricing – and you can be sure that small traders always get the
    worst possible execution for their orders.

    the actual price at which your order was executed in your code and subtract a
    certain amount from the theoretical returns of your model while doing tests. This
    will make the theoretical results at least a tiny bit closer to reality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third, and probably the most counterintuitive conclusion is the fact that
    in an OTC market *there can be multiple different prices for the same financial
    instrument*. It is normal that each liquidity provider, market maker, bank, fund,
    and any other market participant in such a market offers their own price for the
    same product and that these prices co-exist at the very same moment in time.

    exchange-traded market, where any order, even one contract received from a retail
    trader, goes into the *same order book*, which is identical for everyone. You
    can only accept the price offered by other market participants who have permission
    to post prices into this market. These market participants are called **liquidity
    providers** or **market makers** (although it’s important to note that these are

    sellers but they also trade under the supervision of the venue’s management. Thus,
    a traditional farmers’ market is not a financial trading venue in this regard,
    whereas a stock exchange definitely is. The key difference is that trading at
    a trading venue is always supervised or moderated. For example, if someone comes
    into a grocery market and offers to buy whatever produce the sellers have at the
    moment, most likely, the farmers will sell the produce and the market will close
    till next Sunday. If anything similar happens in the financial world, it would
    be a real disaster. So, the trading venue always moderates incoming orders, and
    if the requested trading size is too big, the order will be rejected (or, to be
    more precise, considered a **block order** and treated in a special way – see
    [*Chapter 10*](B19145_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor171)*, Types of Orders and Their Simulation*

- en: Another possible issue with order execution is *partial fill*. This happens
    when the liquidity in the order book is not sufficient to fill the entire order,
    so only part of the order is filled. Normally, you can explicitly specify the
    order type which decides whether the order is to be rejected or partially filled
    if the liquidity is not sufficient. In either case, you have to add an order execution
    control module to your trading application that handles, rejects, and partially
    fills orders.
  prefs: []

    you may want to happen, and still, it is quite possible if you use market orders
    (remember, a market order means *“I want to buy/sell now, regardless of the price”*).
    Now, you understand the reasons why an order may be filled at an *unexpected*
    price – those same liquidity issues. So, in production, it is reasonable to consider
    using limit orders instead of market orders even if the strategy assumes buying
    and selling at market.

    bid prices, and price takers can only buy at the offer price and sell at the bid
    price. Therefore, if you bought an asset, this means you paid the offer price.
    If you want to immediately liquidate your position, you can do that only at the
    bid price. If the market price hasn’t changed since the moment you entered the
    market, you will lose the difference between the bid and ask prices – which is
    the spread. That’s why we say that price takers always pay the spread to price
    givers, who in turn, earn the spread.

    of a previously opened long position, then I have a *short* position. Again, this

    in financial markets it’s really easy. If we talk about equities trading then
    most brokers have an *inventory* of equities and traders can borrow from this
    inventory to sell. If the price of the asset sold this way goes down further,
    then the trader liquidates the position, returns the asset to the broker, and
    pockets some profit. If the price of the asset goes up then… well, the trader
    liquidates the position anyway, returns the asset to the broker, and pays the
    difference – which means pocketing a loss this time.

    can buy approximately €91\. But if the broker provides me with a **credit line**,
    then I can buy from €3,000 to €9,000, or even more with just my $100\. This credit
    line is called a **margin** and the ratio of how much I could buy without a margin
    to how much I can buy with a margin is called the **leverage**. Normally, the
    leverage in the FX market is up to 30:1 for non-professionals and 100:1 for professional
    traders.

    the extent that I have nothing in my trading account, then I would have entered
    a situation called a **margin call**. Historically, this meant that the broker
    would call the client asking to add funds to the account to maintain the position.
    Such a practice is difficult to find today, at least among retail brokers. Today,
    brokers prefer to just force close the positions that drive the client’s account
    into the negative zone because otherwise, it may cause problems not only for the
    client but also for the broker.

    position of €9,000, which I would have to liquidate before any *real* money condenses

    For example, the current price of the asset is $10 but I may buy a future that
    guarantees that its seller will sell me the same asset at $9 in a month, a quarter,
    or any other time span. Then, this month, quarter, or other time span is the expiration
    term of this future contract. In the case that the price of the asset itself is
    greater than $9 by its expiration, then I make money: the seller of the future
    is obliged to sell me the asset at $9 and I can immediately resell it at a higher
    price. If the price of the asset by the expiration is lower than $9, then I lost
    money as I now have the obligation to buy the asset at $9 anyway and I can do

    clients with this market marker that generate a constant **order flow** (stream

    and sells simultaneously, pocketing the difference between bids and asks.

    bought from a market maker, but no one sold. Now, imagine that this happens once
    and then happens very quickly again. Such a scenario can easily develop when most
    traders think the price is going to move in a certain direction and they begin
    buying or selling massively. For the market maker, it means that they no longer
    earn the spread. Even worse, in such a situation, the market maker holds an open
    position in the market – instead of being market neutral – and becomes a trader
    with their PnL now depending on the price movement! Moreover, this position immediately
    creates a floating loss for the market maker (floating means that the position
    is not liquidated yet, so the loss may decrease or further increase with each
    new tick). Of course, market makers don’t like having positions and, therefore,
    they protect themselves.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and short positions is more or less the same. As we already know, there’s not
    much publicly available data from OTC markets in general and the FX market in
    particular, but even from public sources, we can see that this statement is very
    close to reality. For example, FXSSI has nice tools which visualize traders’ sentiment,
    the ratios of open long and short positions, and snapshots of the depth of the
    market. You can find these tools at [https://fxssi.com/tools/](https://fxssi.com/tools/)
    and can check them out yourself. Pay particular attention to the open position
    ratios ([https://fxssi.com/tools/ratios](https://fxssi.com/tools/ratios)). These
    charts report positions from a number of trading venues and it is clearly seen
    that the larger the client base of a trading venue, the more linear the chart
    of the ratio of the open positions. This essentially means that the ratio doesn’t
    change significantly over time and that newly opened long positions are in balance
    with newly opened short ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we sum up all long positions and subtract from this the amount of all short
    positions currently opened with this market maker, then we get the so-called **net
    position** of this market maker. Under normal market conditions, and given the
    market maker has a sufficient number of clients, this net position is always close
    to zero.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there’s panic in the market, or if due to whatever reason most traders begin
    to open more long positions than short (or vice versa), or just a single but very
    large trader opens a very large position, then the market maker’s net position
    is substantially greater than zero. In this case, the market maker opens another
    position that equals their own net position, but in the opposite direction. Say
    the market maker has a client’s net position of 1 million long, then the market
    maker opens a position of 1 million short. In this case, the market maker remains
    market neutral.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may wonder how a market maker can open a position themselves. This is possible
    because OTC markets are very fragmented and there are many large and small market
    participants who may or may not be directly connected. For example, a market maker
    can easily access liquidity provided by large banks and, therefore, hedge their
    net positions there, but their clients, retail traders, are really unlikely to
    access the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second thing market makers can do to protect themselves is to increase the
    spread. As you’ll remember, in an OTC market, the spread is not determined by
    all market participants as there’s no such thing as a centralized exchange and
    a single order book. Instead, any price giver can offer their own price, and market
    makers are no exception. Normally, a market maker has access to better bid and
    ask prices than what they offer to their clients. In this sense, market makers
    act as retailers, buying wholesale liquidity at lower prices and re-selling it
    to retail at higher prices.

    price of the underlying asset went higher (or if you sold the contract and the
    price of the asset went lower). So, a CFD typically works as a proxy for the asset.
    The reason for using CFDs instead of the underlying asset is that in certain jurisdictions,
    any income from CFD trading is not taxed at all. Isn’t it a good reason to consider

    last price – then your order enters the order book at the respective price level
    and is added to the end of the queue (see the *Exchange and order book* section).

    have increased.

    order in the order book and you do not have the ability to improve the best bid
    and the best ask. Only qualified ECN members can improve the best bid and ask.

    early 2000’s it went down to 100,000 – 10 times as low but still too big for small
    retail traders. So those *brokers* offered *mini contracts* and *micro contracts*,
    which of course never left this broker’s closed system.

    and just steal money from their clients. So, we can understand why the mention
    of forex brokers and the word *forex* in general sometimes causes quite an acute
    reaction.

    are regulated and, at the very least, guarantee the safety of the client accounts.
    Of course, it is not a guarantee against losses in trading but that’s a completely
    different story.

    the early 2000s. If at the beginning of the century it was populated mostly by
    banks, then today, the variety of both buy-side and sell-side market participants
    is very diverse and the number of trading venues available to virtually anyone
    is quite considerable.

    to provide direct access to a liquidity pool or an ECN –and then trade along with
    professional market participants in quite a similar manner as if you traded at
    a centralized regulated exchange.

    connect to a trading venue such as an ECN, avoiding platforms such as MetaTrader
    or proprietary trading platforms because they only add unwanted latency to our
    orders. MetaTrader can be used as a monitoring tool to watch for open positions
    and check the correctness of order execution.

    markets – sometimes clear and straightforward, sometimes weird and spooky. But
    I am sure there is one question that has long been spinning in your mind while
    reading all of the aforementioned information.

    historical price data from an unknown source, develop a model using tools you
    don’t fully understand and optimize it using this data, connect to an unknown
    broker and start trading. The question is: will this trading be successful? Most
    likely not.'

    you should realize what exactly you are going to use: whether it’s last trade,
    bid, ask, or both, or anything else. You should check if historical data contains
    correct timestamps and that no tick is dated earlier than the preceding one. You
    may want to make sure the data you use contains information about trading volume
    – otherwise, you won’t be able to develop a wide range of trading strategies.
    You should make sure that data is clean and consistent, and that there are no
    erroneous quotes that will affect the parameters of your strategy during its development.'

    Does it trade large volumes? Does it trade frequently? Does it attempt to trade
    in *problematic* periods of time when liquidity in the market is thin? Answers
    to all these questions will help you make the right choice.

- en: Finally (something which probably should have been first) – you should make
    absolutely sure that your strategy generates trades that are executable and returns
    that will cover all trading costs, including the market spread and any commissions
    that your broker charges you.

- en: In this chapter, we learned about the different ways a market can be organized
    and operated. We familiarized ourselves with key concepts such as exchange, order
    book, and liquidity, noted the possible impact of various factors on price behavior,
    and discovered important intrinsic factors that may negatively affect the performance
    of a trading strategy. With all this fundamental knowledge in mind, we’re ready
    to move on to study the architecture of a trading application in detail, to see
    what we should use in order to meet the challenges of the modern FX market. This
    is what we’re going to do in the next chapter.

    explains the difference between fundamental and technical analysis, focuses on
    the meaning of classical **technical analysis** (**TA**) indicators from a market
    process standpoint, and provides possible implementations of these indicators
    in Python, in a way compatible with further developments. We will also familiarize
    ourselves with the basics of simple data visualization, which is typically used
    to quickly check market data and the correctness of calculations, and generate
    entry and exit orders.'

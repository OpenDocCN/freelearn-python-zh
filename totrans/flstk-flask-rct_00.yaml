- en: In today’s digital age, building web applications that are interactive, dynamic,
    and responsive seamlessly to user interactions is crucial. Flask, an open source,
    micro-web framework written in Python, promotes fast development and embraces
    a clean and practical design approach. On the other hand, React, a JavaScript
    library to build user interfaces, offers an efficient and flexible way to create
    interactive UIs. By combining the power of React and the lightweight Flask framework,
    you’ll gain the ability to create modern full stack web applications with ease.

    explore the fundamentals of React. We will explore concepts such as components,
    props and state, JSX, managing state with React Hooks, data fetching in React,
    displaying lists, events handling, routing with React Router, and unit testing
    with Jest. Then, we’ll continue with full stack application development with Flask.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll cover everything from SQL and data modeling to creating RESTful APIs,
    integrating a React client with the Flask backend, authentication and authorization,
    building modular and reusable Flask applications with Blueprint, error handling,
    unit testing in Flask, and understanding how your web applications can be deployed
    to the cloud. We’ll break down complex concepts into bite-sized pieces, provide
    clear explanations, and offer practical examples to ensure that you grasp each
    topic along the way. Whether you prefer learning by doing or enjoy deep dives
    into the inner workings of these technologies, we’ve got you covered.

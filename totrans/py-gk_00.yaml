- en: Python is a multipurpose language that can be used for solving any medium to
    complex problems in several fields. *Python for Geeks* will teach you how to advance
    in your career with the help of expert tips and tricks.

- en: You'll start by exploring the different ways of using Python optimally, both
    from a design and implementation point of view. Next, you'll understand the lifecycle
    of a large-scale Python project. As you advance, you'll focus on different ways
    of creating an elegant design by modularizing a Python project and learn best
    practices and design patterns for using Python. You'll also discover how to scale
    out Python beyond a single thread and how to implement multiprocessing and multithreading
    in Python. In addition to this, you'll understand how you can not only use Python
    to deploy on a single machine but also using clusters in a private environment
    as well as in public cloud computing environments. You'll then explore data processing
    techniques, focus on reusable, scalable data pipelines, and learn how to use these
    advanced techniques for network automation, serverless functions, and machine
    learning. Finally, you'll focus on strategizing web development design using the
    techniques and best practices covered in the book.

- en: Prior knowledge of Python is a must to get real benefits from this book. You
    will need Python version 3.7 or later installed on your system. All code examples
    have been tested with Python 3.7 and Python 3.8 and expected to work with any
    future 3.x release. A Google Cloud Platform account (a free trial will work fine)
    will be helpful to deploy some code examples in the cloud.

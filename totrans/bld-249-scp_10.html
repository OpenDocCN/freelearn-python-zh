The following is not an exhaustive list, but hopes to give you some good starting points. A general word of advice might be appropriate here, especially for novices: use the Internet to your advantage and do some research before you ask questions on forums. Blender users (and developers) are quite a friendly and helpful bunch but on many forums, simple questions remain unanswered because people feel that the answers can simply be found on the Web or by searching in the forum archives itself and do not warrant the time to answer them. This may be disappointing sometimes, but many of these disappointments may be prevented by some research in advance.</p><div class="section" title="General Blender-related forums and blogs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec76"/>General Blender-related forums and blogs</h1></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" id="id689"/><p>Blender's home page is an important source of information and the following pages should be considered a must read:<a class="indexterm" id="id690"/>

Of special relevance to readers of this book, is the forum on Python and Plug-ins where both novices and experienced Blender hackers will find a helpful crowd to assist with scripting-related issues. The author of this book can be found here as well, under his "varkenvarken" nickname.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.blendernation.com">www.blendernation.com</a>: This site tries to be the central hub of all Blender-related news and succeeds quite well at it.

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a>: It's the main site and very well organized, nevertheless some main sections deserve to be mentioned separately here.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.python.org/download/">www.python.org/download/</a>: Download your full Python distribution here if you do not already have it installed or if the installed version doesn't match Blender's built-in version exactly.</li></ul></div><p>For newcomers and seasoned programmers alike, the following pages offer some useful tutorials on Python in general and some 'how-tos' on specific subjects. All the articles on these pages have a fairly low learning curve:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial">docs.python.org/tutorial</a>: It is especially worth reading for people experienced in other programming languages who want to learn Python. It covers most Python-related issues and should be sufficient for most people to get started with Python.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://docs.python.org/howto">docs.python.org/howto</a>: Detailed information on subjects such as regular expressions, Internet programming, and Python style.</li></ul></div><p>More extensive information on the Python programming language and its bundled modules is available as well. These pages are a credit to their authors and maintainers because although exhaustive in their coverage and depth, they are still very readable.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://docs.python.org/reference/">docs.python.org/reference/</a>: It is the main reference on all language structures such as statements, data types, and exceptions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://docs.python.org/library/">docs.python.org/library/</a>: The ultimate reference for all bundled modules, built-in functions, and objects. Before you even think of programming something yourself, you should check this page to see if a module is already provided that covers your needs.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">pypi.python.org/pypi</a>: If the bundled modules do not provide what you need, chances are some third-party encountered the same problem and wrote a package to deal with the issue. If so, you'll probably find it on Python's Package Index.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/">code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/</a>: Sometimes, you just need a code snippet, code example, or an algorithm to get you started.

This is the page we refer to in this book when we mention "the API documentation". Before you start scripting, read this at least twice from start to finish. It will give you an excellent overview of what is possible and by reading it completely, you will find it easier to find something when you need the information.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:Py/Scripts">wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:Py/Scripts</a>: A catalog of the many, many scripts available for Blender, both the bundled ones and the additional ones people have written. Before trying to invent something on your own, check to see if someone already invented it for you.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/">www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/</a>: The Blender Python API also gives access to many OpenGL functions to draw things directly on screen. The API documentation refers to these pages for detailed information. OpenGL is not a subject taken up lightly so you might want to check some tutorials first if you want to get fancy. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opengl.org/code/">http://www.opengl.org/code/</a> lists some entries that might give a start.</li></ul></div></div>

<div class="section" title="Other sources of information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec80"/>Other sources of information</h1></div></div></div><p>When researching ways to model or animate something, it is essential to look at real life examples. You may find images on the Web easily enough but simple images normally will not give sufficient insight on underlying principles or inner workings. For these, the Wikipedia is a very useful resource and consulted for many things in this book. Below we list some samples.</p><p>A word of warning may be in order though. Wikipedia<a class="indexterm" id="id700"/> has proven itself over the years as a readily accessible and dependable source of information and its quality seems to be comparable to that of printed encyclopedias. However, anyone can alter that information and there may be different views on the subject, so it is always wise to check other resources as well, especially if these are difficult subjects. Good Wikipedia entries generally give a list of external references as well and it is a good idea to check a few of them.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-stroke_cycle">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-stroke_cycle</a></li></ul></div><p>These are some of the pages consulted when creating the examples in this book.

    version of Python, then we will see how to run Python code. In the last couple

    standard library. For this, let's first take a look at the download page, [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/),
    which is, of course, the authoritative place to find Python. You will learn a
    little bit about which versions of Python exist and the one we should choose for
    this book. Then, we'll move on to how to set up Python for this book. Finally,
    we'll check that everything worked the way we wanted.

    version 2.7, which is the final version of the Python 2 series. The Python community
    has promised to maintain version 2.7 independently, making it a very stable target
    for development. The other common version is Python 3, which at the time of writing
    this book is in version 3.6.

    different structure than the standard library. You're free to pick whichever version
    or versions you want for your own projects, but for this book, we'll be using
    Python version 3.

    a package manager, this is probably the best and easiest choice. If we use the

    make sure that the Python programs are able to run from the command line.

    but what if we don't have a specific package we need to install? What if we just
    need a library to help us get the job done, but don't know which specific one
    we need? Well, as the name of the section implies, the Python Package Index is
    actually an index of packages, which classifies the packages according to a number
    of parameters. The index is conveniently hosted at [https://pypi.python.org/pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi).

    package best suits our needs.

    be useful.

    that it wouldn't do you any good and you should select more categories to narrow

    that there are no packages that run all your selected categories.

- en: '*Python Microservices Development* introduces the design and creation of a
    microservice-based application using the popular Python programming language,
    and the Quart web framework. In this book, you will learn about microservice architecture
    and how it differs from the traditional monolithic approach, what the benefits
    are, as well as potential trouble that needs overcoming.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for people familiar with the fundamentals of the Python programming
    language who want to start writing web services, or who have inherited a web service
    they want to modernize. It is expected that the reader will be familiar with simple
    Python structures such as functions and loops, as well as some more advanced features
    such as decorators. Some familiarity with using web applications would be helpful,
    although the fundamentals of application design are covered.

    microservices, the differences between monolithic applications and microservices,
    common benefits and pitfalls, as well as testing and scaling.'

- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Discovering Quart*, covers the Quart web framework and the ways
    in which it can respond to requests, create templated documents, act as middleware,
    handle errors, and read configuration.'

- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Coding, Testing, and Documentation: the Virtuous Cycle*, teaches
    you about the different types of testing that are possible, what benefits each
    type has, and how to set up automatic testing, as well as generating documentation
    in CI pipelines.'

- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Designing Jeeves*, looks at Jeeves, which is the sample application
    we use in this book to explain the various concepts behind microservices. We introduce
    what we need Jeeves to do and describe a monolithic approach to application design,
    covering the web API interface, database use, and worker pools.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Splitting the Monolith*, builds on the monolithic Jeeves described
    in previous chapter. This chapter offers guidance on how to identify components
    that may be good microservices, measuring the effects of changes on the software
    architecture, and how to cleanly migrate features to new microservices.'

- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Interacting with Other Services*, explains how to make web requests
    to other services, how to configure and decide where to send those queries, and
    how to cache results, as well as make the data transfer more efficient.'

- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Securing Your Services*, looks at how authentication, tokens,
    encryption, and security vulnerabilities are all essential topics to consider
    for any service, and here we build an authentication microservice for Jeeves,
    as well as discuss various things to consider when making an application secure
    against attack.'

- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Making a Dashboard*, discusses how many applications will have
    a human view. In this chapter we add a dashboard to Jeeves so that it can be controlled
    using a ReactJS application, as well as discussing where best to add the front-end
    into the microservice architecture.'

    needs to be packaged so that it can be deployed and run. In this chapter, we will
    learn about creating and publishing Python packages, as well as managing dependencies.'

    or experience in a very similar programming language. The basics of Python are
    not covered, and for the fundamentals we recommend a book such as *Learn Python
    Programming*, also from Packt Publishing.

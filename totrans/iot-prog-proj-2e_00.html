<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p><em class="italic">Internet of Things Programming Projects</em> is a comprehensive hands-on guide, designed to walk you through a series of progressively advanced <strong class="bold">Internet of Things</strong> (<strong class="bold">IoT</strong>) projects using Raspberry Pi and <span class="No-Break">associated peripherals.</span></p>
<p>In the initial stages, you will be introduced to the foundational concepts and components surrounding the Raspberry Pi, including a detailed exploration of various models, accessories such as hardware attached on top (HAT), and compatible operating systems. You will begin your journey into IoT by engaging in projects that demonstrate the Raspberry Pi’s capacity to interface with real-time data and control physical devices, setting the stage for more <span class="No-Break">advanced undertakings.</span></p>
<p>As you proceed, you will immerse yourself in the development of web services and IoT applications, creating real-time data displays and innovative solutions such as a weather indicator application. These applications not only provide Python programming and data acquisition skills but also venture into the physical world, utilizing hardware components to create <span class="No-Break">tangible outcomes.</span></p>
<p>In the middle portion of the book, emphasis is laid on building a home security system from scratch. You will learn about the general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins of the Raspberry Pi, sensor integrations, and hands-on alarm system development, using protocols such as message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT). A pivotal point will be reached when we create an MQTT-based standalone IoT alarm module and its <span class="No-Break">associated peripherals.</span></p>
<p>Toward the latter part of the journey, the narrative progresses to more advanced and autonomous IoT projects. You will construct a LoRa-enabled IoT monitoring station capable of measuring various environmental factors, including air quality. This station, powered by a battery, communicates data through LoRa to a LoRaWAN network, illustrating the integration of IoT devices with wider network infrastructures and emphasizing sustainable, <span class="No-Break">battery-operated solutions.</span></p>
<p>Culminating the series of projects is the creation of an IoT robot car, leveraging the Robot Operating System (ROS). This advanced endeavor guides you in building a robot car equipped to send sensory information over the internet through MQTT, facilitating remote control via a web browser or other applications. This project represents a pinnacle of IoT mastery, incorporating robotics, network communications, and remote control functionalities into a <span class="No-Break">unified system.</span></p>
<p>Throughout the book, you will be empowered with the knowledge and skills to build practical, real-world IoT solutions, nurturing creativity and innovation through continuous project enhancement suggestions. From Python programming to hardware interfacing, this book promotes a rich, layered understanding of IoT principles, encouraging a readiness to tackle a myriad of complex problems in the IoT landscape, and stands as a beacon for aspiring IoT enthusiasts to develop robust, versatile, and innovative <span class="No-Break">IoT solutions.</span></p>

- en: Now we will turn our attention to a real computer – the ARM that is embedded
    at the heart of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer. We begin by looking at
    the Raspberry Pi itself and explain how you can enter an assembly program, execute
    it, and observe its execution by examining registers and memory during the process
    of executing instructions. Then, we look at the ARM computer in greater detail.
    First, we examine the ARM’s instruction set, and then we demonstrate its addressing
    modes and how it accesses memory. Finally, we provide an in depth-coverage of
    the way in which subroutines are handled by the ARM.

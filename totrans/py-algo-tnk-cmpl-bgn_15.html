<h3 id="toc_1">9.1 Write, Execute and Debug Python Programs</h3>
<p class="my_basic">So far, you have learned some solid basics about Python programming. Now it's time to explore the process of entering programs into the computer, executing them, observing their performance, examining how they display results, and learning techniques for debugging them.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Debugging is the process of finding and reducing the number of defects (bugs) in a computer program to make it perform as expected.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">As stated in <a href="chapter02.html#toc_5">Section 2.5</a>, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a type of software that enables programmers to write, execute and debug their source code. Examples include IDLE and Visual Studio Code. It's up to you to choose which one you are going to use.</p>
<p class="my_basic">All the instructions you need regarding how to write, execute and debug Python programs on either Windows or Linux are maintained on my website at the following addresses. This gives me the flexibility to review them frequently and keep them up-to-date.</p>

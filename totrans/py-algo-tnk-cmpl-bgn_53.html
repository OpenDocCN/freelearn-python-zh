<p>ii)Using the subprogram cited above, write a Python program that displays the previously mentioned menu and prompts the user to enter a choice (of 1, 2, or 3). If choice 1 or 2 is selected, the program must prompt the user to enter an amount of money and then it must calculate and display the corresponding converted value. The process must repeat as many times as the user wishes.</p>

<h4 id="toc_7">Exercise 37.2-1 Validating Data Input Using a Subprogram</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Do the following:</p>
<p>i)Write a subprogram named getAge that prompts the user to enter their age and returns it. Using a loop control structure, the subprogram must also validate data input and display an error message when the user enters any non-positive values.</p>
<p>ii)Write a subprogram named findMax that accepts a list through its formal argument list and returns the index position of the maximum value of the list.</p>
<p>iii)Using the subprograms cited above, write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the first names, last names, and ages of 50 people into three lists and then displays the name of the oldest person.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Since the subprogram getAge() returns one value, it can be written as a function. The same applies to subprogram findMax() because it also returns one value. The main code must prompt the user to enter the first names, the last names, and the ages of 50 people into lists firstNames, lastNames, and ages respectively. Then, with the help of function findMax(), it can find the index position of the maximum value of list ages. The solution is shown here.</p>

<h4 id="toc_8">Exercise 37.2-2 Sorting a List Using a Subprogram</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Do the following:</p>
<p>i)Write a subprogram named mySwap that accepts a list through its formal argument list, as well as two indexes. The subprogram then swaps the values of the elements at the corresponding index positions.</p>
<p>ii)Using the subprogram mySwap() cited above, write a subprogram named mySort that accepts a list through its formal argument list and then sorts the list using the bubble sort algorithm. It must be able to sort in either ascending or descending order. To do this, include an addition Boolean argument within the formal argument list.</p>
<p>iii)Write a subprogram named displayList that accepts a list through its formal argument list and then displays it.</p>
<p>iv)Using the subprograms mySort() and displayList() cited above, write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the names of 20 people and then displays them twice: once sorted in ascending order, and once in descending order.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see in the Python program below, the void function mySort() uses an adapted version of the bubble sort algorithm. When the value True is passed to the argument ascending, the algorithm sorts list a in ascending order. When the value False is passed, the algorithm sorts list a in descending order.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Moreover, the void function mySort() calls the void function mySwap() every time a swap is required between the contents of two elements.</p>

<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>

<div><p>#Assign to n1 the number of times that value 1 exists in list a</p>
<p>n1 = searchAndCount(1, a)</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Assign to n2 the number of times that value 2 exists in list a</p>

It supports a rich set of libraries and frameworks that enable rapid development. Such fast-paced development often comes with its own baggage that can bring down the overall quality, performance, and extensibility of the application. This book will help you push your Python skill level by teaching you how to build and deploy interesting applications.</p><p>Starting with a simple program, the book takes you all the way through designing and developing robust and efficient applications. It touches upon several important topics in an accessible and fun way.</p><p>A fantasy theme is used as a vehicle to explain various concepts. During the course of this book, you will meet many fictional game characters. While you learn different topics, these imaginary characters will talk to you, ask questions, and request new features.</p><p>Each chapter targets a different aspect of application development. A few initial ones focus on software robustness, packaging, and releasing the application code. The next few chapters are about improving the application's lifetime by making the code extensible, reusable, and readable. You will learn about refactoring, unit testing, design patterns, documentation, and best practices.</p><p>Techniques for identifying bottlenecks and improving performance are covered in a series of three chapters devoted to performance. The last chapter introduces you to GUI development.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec02"/>Important things to note</h1></div></div></div><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The book uses a fun, text-based game theme as a vehicle to explain various application development aspects. However, the book itself is not about developing game applications!</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Every chapter will have its own set of Python source files. Although we will talk through most of the code, you should keep the relevant files at hand. See the <em>Downloading the example code</em> section for more details.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The following is relevant if you are reading the electronic version of this book. Most of the code illustrated in this book is created as images. Try to use 100% zoom for a better reading experience as these code snapshots should appear crisp at zoom level.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The solutions to the exercises (if any) are generally not provided.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">This book provides several external links (URLs) for further reading. Over time, some of these links might end up being broken. If that ever happens, try searching the web with the appropriate search terms.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Some experienced readers may find the code explanation a bit verbose. In this case, you can review the code provided in the supporting material for the book.</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec03"/>Very important note for e-book readers</h1></div></div></div><p>The code illustrations that you see in this book are actually image files or code snapshots.</p><p>The rendering quality of these images will vary depending on your PDF reader's page display resolution and the zoom level.</p><p>If you have trouble clearly reading this code, you may try the following in your PDF or e-book reader:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Set the zoom level to 100%</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Use the page display resolution of 96 pixels/inch or similar</li></ul></div><p>If the problem still persists, you can try with a different resolution.</p><p>How do you set this resolution? It will depend on your e-book reader. For example, if you are using Adobe Reader, go to <strong>Edit</strong> | <strong>Preferences</strong> and then select <strong>Page Display</strong> from the left panel. You will see <strong>Resolution</strong> as an option in the right panel. Select <strong>96 pixels/inch</strong> or similar and see if that helps render the images better.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Developing Simple Applications">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Developing Simple Applications</em>, starts with installation prerequisites and the theme of the book. The first program is a fantasy text-based game presented as a script. An incremental version of this program with new features is then developed using functions. With more features added, the code becomes difficult to manage. To address this, the game application is redesigned using OOP concepts. This application now becomes the reference version for the next few chapters.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Dealing with Exceptions">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Dealing with Exceptions</em>, will teach you how to fix the obvious issues that the code written in the previous chapter has. You will learn how to add exception handling code to make the application robust. You will also learn about the <code class="literal">try…except…finally</code> clause, raising and re-raising exceptions, creating and using custom exception classes, and so on.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Modularize, Package, Deploy!">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Modularize, Package, Deploy!</em>, will teach you how to modularize and package the code written in the earlier chapters. After preparing a package, it will show you how to deploy a source distribution, make incremental releases, set up a private Python package repository, and bring the code under version control.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Documentation and Best Practices">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Documentation and Best Practices</em>, dives into coding standards, which are a set of guidelines that you should follow while developing the code. Complying with these standards can make a significant impact on code readability and the life of the code. In this chapter, you will learn about another important aspect of software development, code documentation, and best practices. It starts with an introduction to the reStructuredText format and uses it to write docstrings. You will create HTML documentation for the code using the Sphinx document generator. The chapter also talks about some important coding standards for writing a Python code and using PyLint to check the code quality.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Unit Testing and Refactoring">Chapter 5</a>,<em> Unit Testing and Refactoring</em>, starts with an introduction to the unit testing framework in Python. You will write some unit tests for the game application developed so far. It covers many other topics, such as using Mock library in unit tests and measuring effectiveness of the unit tests with code coverage. The later part of the chapter talks about many code refactoring techniques. This is the last chapter that makes use of the code developed in the earlier chapters. The following chapters will have their own simplified examples tied to the same high-fantasy theme.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Design Patterns">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Design Patterns</em>, tells you how, during development, you often encounter a recurring problem. Many times, a general solution or recipe exists, which just works for this problem. This is often referred to as a design pattern. This chapter introduces you to some commonly used design patterns. It covers the strategy, simple and abstract factory, and adapter patterns. For each pattern, a simple game scenario will demonstrate a practical problem. You will learn how the design pattern can help solve this problem. Each of these patterns will be implemented using a Pythonic approach.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Performance – Identifying Bottlenecks">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Performance – Identifying Bottlenecks</em>, is the first one in a series of three chapters on performance improvements. You will write a simple program called <em>Gold Hunt</em> that looks harmless until you tweak some parameters. The parameter tweaking reveals performance problems. In this chapter, you will identify the time-consuming blocks of the code. It covers the basic ways to clock the application runtime, profiling the code to identify performance bottlenecks, the basics of memory profiling, and using big-O notation to represent computational complexity.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Improving Performance – Part One">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Improving Performance – Part One</em>, teaches you how to fix some of the performance bottlenecks identified in the previous chapter. Additionally, you will also learn about several techniques, such as algorithm changes, list comprehension, generator expressions, the right choice of data structures, and so on, to improve the application performance.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Improving Performance – Part Two, NumPy and Parallelization">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Improving Performance – Part Two, NumPy and Parallelization,</em> is the final chapter on performance improvements, wherein you will drastically improve the performance of the <em>gold hunt</em> application. The chapter will introduce you to the <code class="literal">NumPy</code> package. It will also introduce you to parallel processing using Python.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Simple GUI Applications">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Simple GUI Applications</em>, is the final chapter and introduces you to simple GUI application development. The chapters so far covered several key aspects of application development using command-line programs. In this chapter, however, you will learn about the <code class="literal">Tkinter</code> module, MVC architecture, and develop a GUI version of the first application developed in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Developing Simple Applications">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Developing Simple Applications.</em>

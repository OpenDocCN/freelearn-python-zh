    charge of validating other parts of the code. Normally, anyone would be tempted
    to say that unit tests validate the "core" of the application, but such a definition
    regards unit tests as secondary, which is not the way they are thought of in this
    book. Unit tests are core, and a critical component of the software and they should
    be treated with the same considerations as the business logic.

    to run in any order, without depending on any previous state.'

    we are going to place our unit tests, and they are going to be called by some
    tool. These files will have `import` statements, to take what we need from our
    business logic (what we intend to test), and inside this file, we program the
    tests themselves. Afterward, a tool will collect our unit tests and run them,
    giving a result.

    files, a Python process will be launched, and our tests will be running on it.
    If the tests fail, the process will have exited with an error code (in a Unix
    environment, this can be any number other than `0`). The standard is that the
    tool runs the test, and prints a dot (`.`) for every successful test; an `F` if
    the test failed (the condition of the test was not satisfied), and an `E` if there
    was an exception.

    testing as much code as possible. To test something bigger, such as a class, we
    would not want to use just unit tests, but rather a test suite, which is a collection
    of unit tests. Each one of them will be testing something more specific, like
    a method of that class.

    it is acceptable (more than that, desirable) to have side effects, and to forget
    about isolation, meaning that we will want to issue HTTP requests, connect to
    databases, and so on. While we'd want our integration tests to actually run as
    the production code would, there are some dependencies we would still want to
    avoid. For example, if your service connects to another external dependency via
    the Internet, then that part would indeed be omitted.

    the database with a Docker container that's built specifically for those tests,

    that in the beginning, the tests fail (red), then we make them pass (green), and
    then we proceed to refactor the code and iterate it.

- en: Unit testing is a really interesting and deep topic, but more importantly, it
    is a critical part of the clean code. Ultimately, unit tests are what determine
    the quality of the code. Unit tests often act as a mirror for the code—when the
    code is easy to test, it's clear and correctly designed, and this will be reflected
    in the unit tests.

- en: The code for the unit tests is as important as production code. All principles
    that apply to production code also apply to unit tests. This means that they should
    be designed and maintained with the same effort and thoughtfulness. If we don't
    care about our unit tests, they will start to have problems and become defective
    (or problematic) and, as a result of that, useless. If this happens, and they
    are hard to maintain, they become a liability, which makes things even worse,
    because people will tend to ignore them or disable them entirely. This is the
    worst scenario because once this happens, the entire production code is in jeopardy.
    Moving forward blindly (without unit tests) is a recipe for disaster.

    and available through `pip`. They are of great help and investing time in configuring
    them pays off in the long run.

    and the proof that a piece of software works according to the specification, and
    we also learned that when it comes to discovering new testing scenarios, there
    is always room for improvement and we can always create more tests. In this sense,
    expanding our unit tests with different approaches (such as property-based testing
    or mutation testing) is a good investment.

    trading from two standpoints: we learned about the market itself, its participants,
    the way it operates, and how all this is reflected in the pricing; on the other
    hand, we did some preparation work in programming, so now we can retrieve and
    process market data, build technical indicators, and do some charts and plots.
    In other words, we have the heart and the bones of the body of our future trading
    application, and now it’s time to add brains and limbs: the trading logic that
    generates orders, and the order execution control mechanism that finally connects
    the app with the final destination – an exchange, a broker, or an **electronic

    section in [*Chapter 6*](B19145_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101)*,* *Basics of Fundamental
    Analysis and Its Possible Use in FX Trading*, for a discussion on *carry trading*)
    and these interest rates change over time based on central banks' decisions. So,
    when you buy and hold a stock, it normally brings you dividends, or in the worst
    case, you just don’t receive anything if the board decides not to pay dividends
    this year. However, if you buy and hold a currency, it’s quite possible that you
    pay for the luxury of having this currency in your portfolio – if the difference
    in the interest rates between the two currencies in a pair is negative.

    trading venue is 145.972\. The difference between the real currency pair (EURJPY)
    and our synthetically calculated rate is 0.9 pips. So, we immediately sell USDJPY
    (thus, we have JPY and have sold USD) and EURUSD (thus we have USD and have sold
    EUR), which efficiently creates a short position in EURJPY. At the same time,
    we buy EURJPY, from where it’s traded at a mispriced rate and makes a profit of
    0.9 pips.

- en: So, it’s clear that HFT is a domain in which Python will fail because of its
    speed. Most HFT algos are written in C++ or sometimes in C, with the most critical
    parts sometimes in Assembler. It’s worth mentioning again that compilers such
    as Numba or Cython may dramatically increase the speed of Python code; however,
    they cannot achieve the speed of compiled C or C++ code. Besides that, all Python-based
    solutions have very limited support for FPGAs, so sometimes professional algo
    traders say that Python is suitable only for *slow HFT* algorithms (which work
    in milliseconds not microseconds).

    to consider HFT trading strategies in this book. Just be aware when you see a
    nice order in the order book, you cannot always grasp it for your profit!

- en: In this chapter, we learned about the key terms and concepts of systematic and
    algo trading. We familiarized ourselves with alpha and beta as risk metrics in
    investment and at the same time, as different methods for profit generation in
    algo trading. We considered a few popular alpha-generating trading strategies
    and learned about their advantages, shortcomings, and associated risks. We also
    touched on the complex domain of options trading as the primary method to earn
    on market beta and gave a quick look at other trading strategies, such as arbitrage
    and stat arb, market-making, and HFT.

    exit the market, the last obstacle on our way to a first trading application is
    the mechanism that generates orders according to the strategy rules, sends them
    to the market, and controls their execution. Recalling the analogy at the beginning
    of this chapter, now we have added the brains to our trading app, and it’s time
    to add the limbs with which it will be able to move. This is what we are going
    to develop in the very next chapter.

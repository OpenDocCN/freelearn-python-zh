    additional information on almost any Blender subject you can think of. The following
    is not an exhaustive list, but hopes to give you some good starting points. A
    general word of advice might be appropriate here, especially for novices: use
    the Internet to your advantage and do some research before you ask questions on
    forums. Blender users (and developers) are quite a friendly and helpful bunch
    but on many forums, simple questions remain unanswered because people feel that
    the answers can simply be found on the Web or by searching in the forum archives
    itself and do not warrant the time to answer them. This may be disappointing sometimes,
    but many of these disappointments may be prevented by some research in advance.'

- en: When researching ways to model or animate something, it is essential to look
    at real life examples. You may find images on the Web easily enough but simple
    images normally will not give sufficient insight on underlying principles or inner
    workings. For these, the Wikipedia is a very useful resource and consulted for
    many things in this book. Below we list some samples.

    years as a readily accessible and dependable source of information and its quality
    seems to be comparable to that of printed encyclopedias. However, anyone can alter
    that information and there may be different views on the subject, so it is always
    wise to check other resources as well, especially if these are difficult subjects.
    Good Wikipedia entries generally give a list of external references as well and
    it is a good idea to check a few of them.

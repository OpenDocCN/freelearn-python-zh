Almost every version of Blender brought new features—some small and some very sophisticated indeed. The changes in Blender's development are neatly documented on the Blender site at: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/">http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/</a>.</p><p>Blender's current, stable version is 2.49 and this version will probably stay around for sometime because Blender is no longer 'just' an open source package used by 3D enthusiasts but a viable production tool used in different parts of the production pipeline by professional studios. </p><p>Nevertheless, as of writing this book, the development of a new version of Blender is in full swing. The version number, 2.50, may lead you to believe that this is just a minor change but in fact, it is almost a complete rewrite. The most visible part is a completely different graphical user interface. This interface is almost completely written in Python, which opens up endless opportunities for writing sophisticated user interfaces to replace the limited possibilities in 2.49.</p><p>Not only the user interface is changed but also the internal structure is overhauled completely and although most of the functionality exposed in the Python API stays similar in nature, there are numerous changes in most of Blender's modules.</p><p>One major drawback is that the new version is developed alongside the Durian project (which will produce the open source movie "Sintel", see <a class="ulink" href="http://durian.blender.org">durian.blender.org</a>), so the main development goals for version 2.50 are providing all of the functionality for this project. This does cover most issues, but some parts, notably Pynodes and screen handlers, will not be provided in the first production release.</p><p>On the positive side it will no longer be necessary to install a full Pythondistribution alongside Blender as the new version will be bundled with a full Python distribution.</p><p>The road map for Blender's 2.50 development may be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-250/">http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-250/</a> but the timetable mentioned there is of course very preliminary. A full production version is expected somewhere late 2010 and will have a version number of 2.6.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Python"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec85"/>Python</h1></div></div></div><a class="indexterm" id="id708"/><p>The new version of Blender will be bundled with a full Python 3.x distribution obviating the need for a separate installation of Python. This version of Python is already very stable and it is unlikely that major changes will be implemented in the near future.</p><p>Version 3.x is different from version 2.6 but most significant changes are below the surface and mostly won't concern a Blender scripter.</p><p>There is a notable side effect of the new Python version though: many third-party packages (that is, Python packages not bundled with the distribution) are not (yet) ported to version 3.x. In some situations this might be a considerable nuisance. From the packages used in this book the most notable one that is not yet ported to version 3.x is PIL (Python Imaging Library). That one is surely missed as it provides sophisticated 2D functionality not present in Blender.</p><p>Another package not yet ported to 3.x is Psyco—the just-in-time compiler—but Python 3 already is quite a bit faster in many situations so the speed increase attainable by a package such as Psyco might not be worth the trouble.</p><p>To increase the speed of acceptance of Python 3.x Python's developers have declared a moratorium on the addition of new features so that packages developers won't have to aim at a moving target.

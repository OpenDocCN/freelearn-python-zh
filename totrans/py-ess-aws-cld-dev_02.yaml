    examples and multiple use cases, so it would be useful to create an account in
    order to follow along with the exercises in the rest of the chapters on AWS. Let’s
    learn how to create an AWS account.

    for the root user. In addition to that, the root user has full access to all services.
    This is something you need to consider in terms of protecting your account.'

    next to the account ID. You can name it while creating an AWS account. You can
    have multiple accounts under the root account to implement different projects.
    In some cases, you need to separate the services and costs. In this case, creating
    multiple accounts could be a good solution.'

    an AWS service that has a big cost or is constantly running, this limited card
    could prevent you from overspending.

- en: In this chapter, we looked into AWS account creation. The AWS account will help
    you to carry out Python exercises in the cloud environment. The point to note
    is that AWS is a paid service and you have to consider the cost of what you are
    going to use. In the next chapter, we will take a look at popular services such
    as Lambda.

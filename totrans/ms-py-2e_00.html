    <h1 id="_idParaDest-4" class="mainHeading">Preface</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Python is a language that is easy to learn and anyone can get started with a “Hello, World!” script within minutes. Mastering Python, however, is a completely different question.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Every programming problem has multiple possible solutions and choosing the Pythonic (idiomatic Python) solution is not always obvious; it can also change with time. This book will not only illustrate a range of different and new techniques but also explain where and when a method should be applied. To quote <em class="italic">The Zen of Python</em> by Tim Peters: </p>&#13;
    <blockquote class="packt_quote">&#13;
      <p class="quote">“There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.”</p>&#13;
    </blockquote>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Even though it does not always help, the author of this book is actually Dutch.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This book is not a beginner’s guide to Python. It is a book that can teach you about the more advanced techniques possible within Python, such as <code class="inlineCode">asyncio</code>. It even includes Python 3.10 features, such as structural pattern matching (Python’s <code class="inlineCode">switch</code> statement), in great detail.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">As a Python programmer with many years of experience, I will attempt to rationalize the choices made in this book with relevant background information. These rationalizations are in no way strict guidelines, however, as several of these cases boil down to personal style in the end. Just know that they stem from experience and are, in many cases, the solutions recommended by the Python community.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Some of the references in this book might not be obvious to you if you are not a fan of Monty Python. This book regularly uses <code class="inlineCode">spam</code> and <code class="inlineCode">eggs</code> instead of <code class="inlineCode">foo</code> and <code class="inlineCode">bar</code> in code samples because the Python programming language was named after Monty Python. To provide some background information about <code class="inlineCode">spam</code> and <code class="inlineCode">eggs</code>, I would recommend you watch the <em class="italic">Spam</em> sketch from Monty Python. It is positively silly.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="heading-1">Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This book is meant for programmers who are already experienced in Python and want to learn more about the advanced features that Python offers. With the depth of this book, I can guarantee that almost anyone can learn something new here if they wish.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">If you only know the basics of Python, however, don’t worry. The book starts off relatively slow and builds to the more advanced subjects, so you should be fine.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="heading-1">What this book covers</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Getting Started – One Environment per Project</em>, demonstrates several options for managing Python versions, virtual environments, and package dependencies.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Interactive Python Interpreters</em>, explores Python interpreter options. Python’s default interpreter is perfectly functional, but better alternatives are available. With a few modifications or a replacement, you can get auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and graphical output.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Pythonic Syntax and Common Pitfalls</em>, discusses Pythonic coding, which is the art of writing beautiful and readable Python code. This chapter is not the holy grail, but it is filled with tips and best practices to achieve something along those lines.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Pythonic Design Patterns</em>, continues on the theme of <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>. Writing Pythonic code is not just about code style, but also about using the right design patterns and data structures. This chapter tells you about the data structures available and their performance characteristics.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Functional Programming – Readability Versus Brevity</em>, covers functional programming. Functional programming is considered a bit of a black art by some, but when applied correctly it can be a really powerful tool that makes code reuse trivial. It is probably as close to the underlying mathematics as you can get within programming.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Decorators – Enabling Code Reuse by Decorating</em>, discusses decorators, an amazing tool for reusing a method. With decorators, you can wrap functions and classes with some other function to modify their parameters and return values – an extremely useful tool.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Generators and Coroutines – Infinity, One Step at a Time</em>, discusses generators. Lists and tuples are fantastic if you already know that you are going to use every element, but the faster alternative is to only calculate the elements you actually need. That is what a generator does for you: generate items on demand.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Metaclasses – Making Classes (not Instances) Smarter</em>, explores metaclasses, the classes that make other classes. It is a magic you rarely need, but it does have practical uses cases such as plugin systems.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Documentation – How to Use Sphinx and reStructuredText</em>, gives you some documentation-related tips. Writing documentation might not be the favorite activity for most programmers, but it is useful. This chapter shows you how to make that easier by using Sphinx and reStructuredText to generate large portions automatically.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Testing and Logging – Preparing for Bugs</em>, covers how to implement tests and logging to prevent and detect bugs. Bugs are inevitable and by using logging, we can trace the cause. Often, bugs can be prevented by using tests. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Debugging – Solving the Bugs</em>, builds on <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>. The previous chapter helped us find the bugs; now we need to solve them. Debuggers can be a huge help when hunting down difficult bugs, and this chapter shows you several debugging options.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Performance – Tracking and Reducing Your Memory and CPU Usage</em>, discusses the performance of your code. A common problem programmers have is trying to optimize code that does not need it, a fun but generally futile exercise. This chapter helps you find the code that needs to be optimized.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">asyncio – Multithreading without Threads</em>, covers <code class="inlineCode">asyncio</code>. Waiting for external resources such as network resources is the most common bottleneck for applications. With <code class="inlineCode">asyncio</code>, we can stop waiting for those bottlenecks and switch to another task instead.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Multiprocessing – When a Single CPU Core Is Not Enough</em>, discusses performance from a different perspective. With multiprocessing, we can use multiple processors (even remotely) in parallel. When your processor is the bottleneck, this can help a lot.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italic">Scientific Python and Plotting</em>, covers the most important libraries for scientific computing. Python has become the language of choice for scientific purposes.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italic">Artificial Intelligence</em>, shows many AI algorithms and the libraries available for implementing them. In addition to being the language of choice for scientific purposes, most AI libraries are currently being built using Python as well. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 17</em>, <em class="italic">Extensions in C/C++, System Calls, and C/C++ Libraries</em>, shows you how to use existing C/C++ libraries from Python, which not only allows reuse but can also speed up execution greatly. Python is a wonderful language, but it is often not the fastest solution. </p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Packaging – Creating Your Own Libraries or Applications</em>, will help you package your code into a fully functioning Python package that others can use. After building your wonderful new library, you might want to share it with the world. </p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="heading-1">To get the most out of this book</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Depending on your level of experience you should start reading from the beginning, or gloss over the chapters to skip to sections that are interesting for you. This book is suitable for intermediate to expert level Python programmers, but not all sections will be equally useful for everyone.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">As an example, the first two chapters are about setting up your environment and Python interpreter and seem like chapters you can skip entirely as an advanced or expert Python programmer, but I would advise against fully skipping them, as a few useful utilities and libraries are covered which you might not be familiar with.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The chapters of this book do build on each other to a certain degree, but there is no strict reading order and you can easily cherry-pick the parts you wish to read. If there is a reference to an earlier chapter, it is clearly indicated.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The most up-to-date version of the code samples can always be found at <a href="https://github.com/mastering-python/code_2"><span class="url">https://github.com/mastering-python/code_2</span></a>.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">The code in this repository is automatically tested and, if you have any suggestions, pull requests are always welcome.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Most chapters of this book also include exercises at the end that will allow you to test what you have learned. Since there are always multiple solutions to problems, you, and every other reader of this book, can submit and compare your solutions on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mastering-python/exercises"><span class="url">https://github.com/mastering-python/exercises</span></a></p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">You are encouraged to create a pull request with your solution to the problems. And you can learn from others here as well, of course.</p>&#13;

    <h2 id="_idParaDest-10" class="heading-2">Conventions used</h2>&#13;
    <p class="normal">There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">While this book largely adheres to the PEP8 styling conventions, there are a few concessions made due to the space limitations of a book format. Simply put, code samples that span multiple pages are hard to read, so some parts use less whitespace than you would usually expect. The full version of the code is available on GitHub and is automatically tested to be PEP8-compliant.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><code class="inlineCode">CodeInText</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. For example: “The <code class="inlineCode">itertools.chain()</code> generator is one of the simplest yet one of the most useful generators in the Python library.”</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">A block of code is set as follows:</p>&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> . <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> base&#13;

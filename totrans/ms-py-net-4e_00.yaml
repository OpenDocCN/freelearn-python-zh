- en: As Charles Dickens wrote in *A Tale of Two Cities, “It was the best of times,
    it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness.”*
    These seemingly contradictory words perfectly describe the chaos and mood felt
    during a time of change and transition. We are undoubtedly experiencing a similar
    time with the rapid changes in the network engineering field. As software development
    becomes more integrated into all engineering stacks, the traditional command-line
    interface and vertically integrated network control methods are no longer the
    best ways to manage today’s networks.

    opportunities and yet are challenging, particularly for those who need to quickly
    adapt and keep up. This book has been written to help ease the transition for
    networking professionals by providing a practical guide that addresses how to
    evolve from a traditional platform to one built on software-driven and development
    practices.

    network engineering tasks. Python is an easy-to-learn, high-level programming
    language that can effectively complement network engineers’ creativity and problem-solving
    skills to streamline daily operations. Python is becoming an integral part of
    many large-scale networks, and through this book, I hope to share with you the
    lessons I’ve learned.

    fortunate to have had interesting and meaningful conversations with many of the
    book’s readers. I am humbled by the success of the first three editions and took
    to heart the feedback I was given. In this fourth edition, I tried to incorporate
    many of the newer libraries, updated existing examples with the latest software
    and newer hardware platforms, added two new chapters, and significantly modified
    several chapters. I believe the changes are more reflective of today’s network
    engineering environment.

    technologies for internet communication today, from the OSI and client-server
    model to the TCP, UDP, and IP suites. The chapter will review the basics of the
    Python language, such as types, operators, loops, functions, and packages.'

- en: '*Chapter* *2*, *Low-Level Network Device Interactions*, uses practical examples
    to illustrate how to use Python to execute commands on a network device. It will
    also discuss the challenges of having a CLI-only interface in automation. The
    chapter will use the Pexpect, Paramiko, Netmiko, and Nornir libraries in the examples.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter* *3*, *APIs and Intent-Driven Networking*, discusses the network devices
    that support **Application** **Programming** **Interfaces** (**APIs**) and other
    high-level interaction methods. It also illustrates tools that allow the abstraction
    of low-level tasks while focusing on the intent of the network engineers. A discussion
    about and examples of Cisco NX-API, Meraki, Juniper PyEZ, Arista Pyeapi, and Vyatta
    VyOS will appear in the chapter.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter* *4*, *The Python Automation Framework – Ansible*, discusses the basics
    of Ansible. Ansible is an open source, Python-based automation framework. The
    framework moves one step further from APIs and focuses on declarative task intent.
    In this chapter, we will cover the advantages of using Ansible and its high-level
    architecture and see some practical examples of Ansible with network devices.'

    monitoring tools. The chapter will start with using Graphviz to graph the network
    from LLDP information. We will move to use examples with push-based network monitoring
    using NetFlow and other technologies. We will use Python to decode flow packets
    and ntop to visualize the results.'

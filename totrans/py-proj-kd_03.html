You created your own function and learned how to get basic information from a user with the <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> function. Using these building blocks, you can begin to design basic programs.</p><p>The first program we make will be a five-function calculator that calculates two numbers as input. The calculator will help us learn to understand the mathematical functions that are a part of Python, which will be useful for our game at the end of the book. In addition to this, this calculator will form the foundation for a more complex calculator in <a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Loops and Logic">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Loops and Logic</em></span>.</p><div class="section" title="The calculator"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec22"/>The calculator</h1></div></div></div><p>The first<a id="id81" class="indexterm"/> calculator was invented in 1966 at Texas Instruments (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/eps/1960/docs/67-handheld_calc_invented.htm">http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/eps/1960/docs/67-handheld_calc_invented.htm</a>) and was able to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and<a id="id82" class="indexterm"/> division. The calculator had eighteen keys and could display twelve numbers on the screen. While it doesn't seem like much at first, especially compared to the technology we now enjoy, there is quite a lot of code and decision making that go into the operations that a basic calculator performs.</p><p>When we want to figure out how something works, we need to break it down into smaller parts. Let's take a look at how the calculator adds numbers together:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First, the calculator needs power.</li><li class="listitem">The user enters the first number.</li><li class="listitem">The user presses an operation key (<span class="emphasis"><em>+</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>-</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>*</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>/</em></span>).</li><li class="listitem">The user enters a second number.</li><li class="listitem">The user presses the <span class="emphasis"><em>=</em></span> key.</li><li class="listitem">Then, an answer is printed to the screen.</li></ol></div><p>On a basic calculator, the computer does not keep all of the numbers on the screen. The computer must store the first number that the user entered in its memory.</p><p>We will run our first calculator program inside of the terminal/command prompt, so there are other things we must consider in addition to how the numbers will be stored. For example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How <a id="id83" class="indexterm"/>will we prompt the user to get the information that we need?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What happens if the user enters a text string instead of integers or floats?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What happens if the user enters numbers as a string instead of as integers or floats?</li></ul></div><p>These are just some of the logical questions that need to be considered as we plan how to write our own calculator program. Can you think of any other problems that need to be solved?</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Basic functions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec23"/>Basic functions</h1></div></div></div><p>We learned at<a id="id84" class="indexterm"/> the beginning of this chapter that the first electronic calculator had four basic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We will be working on programming each of these functions, and we will also learn a fifth mathematical function that we can program for our calculator called modulo.</p><p>Through the beginning of this chapter, we will use the <code class="literal">addition()</code> function as our example. Once we have created and tested an <code class="literal">addition()</code> function that does what we want it to, we will then build our other functions.</p><p>Let's return to our example of the addition function in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Variables, Functions, and Users">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Variables, Functions, and Users</em></span>. Recall how we programmed this function:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_01.jpg" alt="Basic functions"/></div><p>The addition function in the preceding screenshot does perform proper addition and prints the answer. However, there are problems with designing an <code class="literal">addition()</code> function this way. One problem is that the program can only add the same two numbers over and over again. Another problem is that, in this program, we are only using one mathematical operation (addition). This <code class="literal">addition()</code> function is too inflexible on its own; we need to design a function that is more user friendly.</p><p>To design<a id="id85" class="indexterm"/> a better mathematical function, we need to solve the problem of user-inputs by letting the user change the numbers in the calculation. We also need to design a calculator where the user has mathematical functions other than addition that can be performed.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Operations on two numbers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec24"/>Operations on two numbers</h1></div></div></div><p>We <a id="id86" class="indexterm"/>are going to use the <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> function that we learned about in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Variables, Functions, and Users">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Variables, Functions, and Users</em></span>. Recall that from this chapter, we cannot perform addition on two strings. In fact, we cannot perform any kind of mathematical operations on strings.</p><p>The following code asks for user input and stores the input in the computer as strings. Type the following code in your Python shell to take a look at the results:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>def addition():</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    first = raw_input('I will add two numbers. Enter the first number')</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    second = raw_input('Now enter the second number.')</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    print(first + second)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>What happens when you call the <code class="literal">addition()</code> function? If you call the <code class="literal">addition()</code> function, you will see that the addition has <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> happened. This program just prints the two numbers together, side by side, in the order that they were entered by the user:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_12_replace.jpg" alt="Operations on two numbers"/></div><p>While putting information side by side is useful to combine words into a phrase or sentence, it is not very helpful in performing calculations with numbers, as we discovered in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Variables, Functions, and Users">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Variables, Functions, and Users</em></span>. Instead, you will want to convert the user's answer to a number so that you can perform mathematical operations on the numbers. To<a id="id87" class="indexterm"/> convert the <code class="literal">input()</code> function to a number, you will use <code class="literal">int()</code> or the <code class="literal">float()</code> functions.</p><div class="section" title="Convert data into numbers – int() and float()"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec19"/>Convert data into numbers – int() and float()</h2></div></div></div><p>In order <a id="id88" class="indexterm"/>to change the user data entered in the <code class="literal">raw_input()</code> function from a string to a number, we need to use the whole-number-integer, <code class="literal">int()</code>, or floating-point-number, <code class="literal">float()</code>, functions to make the computer interpret the answer as a number.</p><div class="section" title="Floating point to whole number conversion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec07"/>Floating point to whole number conversion</h3></div></div></div><p>To try an example, type the following <a id="id89" class="indexterm"/>in your Python shell, and pay attention to the results:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>a = int(44.5)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>b = float(44.5)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>print(a)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>print(b)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>In the preceding example, with <code class="literal">44.5</code>, you should notice that the <code class="literal">int()</code> function rounds up the number to <code class="literal">44</code>, while the <code class="literal">float()</code> function keeps the number at <code class="literal">44.5</code>. This is because <code class="literal">int()</code> likes whole numbers and rounds numbers down automatically. Take a look at this screenshot from the Python shell:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_03.jpg" alt="Floating point to whole number conversion"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Whole number to floating point conversion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec08"/>Whole number to floating point conversion</h3></div></div></div><p>Now, try the reverse. Convert a <a id="id90" class="indexterm"/>whole number into an integer and a float using this code in your Python shell:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong> a = int(24)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong> b = float(24)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong> print(a)</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong> print(b)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>In the preceding sample code, you see that the <code class="literal">int()</code> function keeps the number at <code class="literal">24</code>, while the <code class="literal">float()</code> function adds a decimal place to the number, making it print as <code class="literal">24.0</code>. This is because float is designed to deal with numbers and their decimal places. You can see the results in this screenshot of the Python shell:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_04.jpg" alt="Whole number to floating point conversion"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Text strings fail in int() and float()"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec09"/>Text strings fail in int() and float()</h3></div></div></div><p>If you<a id="id91" class="indexterm"/> try to enter a text string into the <code class="literal">int()</code> or <code class="literal">float()</code> functions, you will get an error. In fact, you will only be able to type the first line of these two lines into your Python shell. This will immediately evaluate the <code class="literal">int('hello')</code> code as an error:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>    int('hello')</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    float('hello')</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>This happens because <code class="literal">int()</code> and <code class="literal">float()</code> apply specifically to numbers and do not deal with things that cannot be changed into numbers. In the following screenshot, notice that the Python shell returns something called a traceback with three lines of error code:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_05.jpg" alt="Text strings fail in int() and float()"/></div><p>We will switch between <a id="id92" class="indexterm"/>using <code class="literal">int()</code> and <code class="literal">float()</code> throughout the book so that you become used to using both functions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">int()</code>: This function converts data into a whole number</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">float()</code>: This function converts data into a number with decimal places</li></ul></div><p>Now that we know about converting strings into numbers, let's rewrite our addition function, get input from the user, and convert the input into decimal numbers using the <code class="literal">float()</code> function. You can copy this code directly into your text editor:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  def addition():</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    first = float(input('What is your first number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    second = float(input('What is your second number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>    print(first + second)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>In the following screenshot, you see the Python shell with the addition function defined. You also see that when the addition function is called, each <code class="literal">raw_input</code> line is printed and the user answers by typing in a number. The first and second input have been converted into integers, so when the answer is added together you will notice that the output is now correct according to the standard rules of addition:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_06.jpg" alt="Text strings fail in int() and float()"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Creating our first calculator file"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec10"/>Creating our first calculator file</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's <a id="id93" class="indexterm"/>save your work before we continue. Open your text editor and make a file called <code class="literal">first_calc.py</code>, then type the addition function that you just made into that file. Make sure you save the file in your work folder that you made on your desktop back in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Welcome! Let's Get Started">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Welcome! Let's Get Started</em></span>. It is important to keep your work organized so that you can run your code to test it and show it off:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_07.jpg" alt="Creating our first calculator file"/></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="New functions &#x2013; subtraction, multiplication, and division"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec25"/>New functions – subtraction, multiplication, and division</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that <a id="id94" class="indexterm"/>we have created an <code class="literal">addition()</code> function that accepts data <a id="id95" class="indexterm"/>from the user and converts it into numbers, we are ready to <a id="id96" class="indexterm"/>create functions for subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p><p>If you are coming back to this after a break, perform the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open your Python shell so that you can test your code as you write.</li><li class="listitem">Next, open your text editor (jEdit in Mac/Linux and Notepad ++ in Windows).</li><li class="listitem">Have both windows open on your desktop as you program.</li><li class="listitem">When you successfully write and test a line or a few lines of code in the Python shell, copy the lines into your text editor and then <span class="emphasis"><em>Save Your Work</em></span> to the <code class="literal">first_calc.py</code> file that you created earlier in this chapter.</li></ol></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip04"/>Tip</h3><p>Save your work early and as often as you can! Avoid being upset by accidentally erasing your code!</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Subtraction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec20"/>Subtraction</h2></div></div></div><p>For the<a id="id97" class="indexterm"/> next part of our calculator, we will make our subtraction function. We will follow the same prompts as we used for the addition function to create a second function that performs subtraction. In your Python shell, try these steps to create the subtraction function:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Type <code class="literal">def</code> to start your function.</li><li class="listitem">Name your function.</li><li class="listitem">Add proper syntax, which is parenthesis <code class="literal">()</code> and <code class="literal">:</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Tab the remaining lines in four spaces each.</li><li class="listitem">Request the first number from the user.</li><li class="listitem">Request the second number from the user.</li><li class="listitem">Print the output using the minus (<code class="literal">-</code>) symbol for subtraction.</li></ol></div><p>Once you have tried creating this function in the Python shell, try calling the function using this line of code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>  subtraction()</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>If the function call works, then you can type your code into your code file exactly as it appears in your Python shell. If your <code class="literal">subtraction()</code> function does not run, make sure you did not make any errors when typing your code in the shell. Double-check your code and rerun it until it is smooth. If you are stuck, you can copy the lines of the following code into your Python shell; they will perform subtraction on two integers:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>def subtraction():</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  first = int(raw_input('What is your first number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  second = int(raw_input('What is your second number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  print(first - second)</strong></span>

<span class="strong"><strong>subtraction()</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Once you have tested your code in the shell, you can then type it into your text editor. Remember to save your work in your <code class="literal">first_calc.py</code> file. Your <code class="literal">first_calc.py</code> file should now look something like this:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_08_Revised.jpg" alt="Subtraction"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Multiplication"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec21"/>Multiplication</h2></div></div></div><p>By now, you might have observed a pattern in our functions. The multiplication function will follow the <a id="id98" class="indexterm"/>same format and logic rules as the addition and subtraction functions. You can continue to ask the user to enter each number, and then the computer will perform a proper calculation.</p><p>The following code is for the multiplication function. You can copy it directly, but it is a better idea to try to create the multiplication function on your own. If you try to create your function, you will know how well you have learned the way to create a function. When you are ready, you will see this code for the multiplication function:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>def multiplication():</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  first = int(raw_input('What is your first number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  second = int(raw_input('What is your second number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  print(first * second)</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>Once you have tested your code in your Python shell, remember to type the function in your text editor and save your work in your <code class="literal">first_calc.py</code> file:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_09.jpg" alt="Multiplication"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Division"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec22"/>Division</h2></div></div></div><p>Division is <a id="id99" class="indexterm"/>the final basic operation that we will program for our first calculator program. As with multiplication, you have already done most of the work for the division part of the calculator. See if you can recall how to create a division function from scratch. Once you have tested your code, compare it to the following code and see if it matches up:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>def division():</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  first = int(raw_input('What is your first number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  second = int(raw_input('What is your second number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  print(first / second)</strong></span>

<div class="section" title="Finding a remainder &#x2013; modulo"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec26"/>Finding a remainder – modulo</h1></div></div></div><p>Modulo<a id="id100" class="indexterm"/> can seem like a strange concept. In fact, unless you are a <a id="id101" class="indexterm"/>programmer, it is likely that you have never heard of modulo. Modulo is a mathematical function that allows us to do a division problem but only return the remainder. Why is this even useful? Why is it a good idea, and why should we care?</p><p>Usually, we want to know the entire answer to a division problem—the quotient and the remainder. There are times, though, when we will only want to know the remainder of the division problem. We will only care about what is leftover. Modulo is like a monster eating our dessert: we give the monster numbers to divide, and it just gives us leftovers.</p><p>While modulo is not especially useful in the world of school arithmetic, it can be very useful in moving objects in a game. So, it is good for us to build a modulo function and learn how modulo works.</p><p>To build a modulo function, you will need to get user input, just like all of the other functions you made. Then, you will call the modulo function. The symbol for modulo is <code class="literal">%</code> You can place the modulo operator where you would normally place the division sign. Copy the following code in your Python shell as an example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"><span class="strong"><strong>def modulo():</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  first = int(raw_input('What is your first number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  second = int(raw_input('What is your second number?'))</strong></span>
<span class="strong"><strong>  print(first % second)</strong></span>
</pre></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B04681_03_11.jpg" alt="Finding a remainder – modulo"/></div><p>In the <a id="id102" class="indexterm"/>preceding screenshot, you can see how we added the modulo<a id="id103" class="indexterm"/> function to the other functions. If you still find modulo confusing, don't worry right away. Just know that it might come up as you are designing games, and you can check back here, as well as do an Internet, search to better understand modulo.</p></div>

</pre></div><p>Your program should run through addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo, and print answers to the user for each set of numbers that they enter. If there are errors when the program runs, the error messages from your computer will usually tell you that something is wrong. The error message will even tell you what line of code in your file has<a id="id105" class="indexterm"/> the problem so that it is easier to debug (find and fix errors in) your code.</p></div>

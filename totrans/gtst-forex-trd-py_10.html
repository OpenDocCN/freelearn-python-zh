<h1 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Types of Orders and Their Simulation in Python</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we considered a number of classical trading strategies usually employed in FX trading. All of them can be automated – that is, the decision to place a trade can be made based on quantitative data only, and placing a trade in the market can be done by an algorithm. So, we need now to find a proper way to place trades and control their execution.</p>
<p>We already mentioned (see <a href="B19145_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Developing Trading Strategies – Why They Are Different</em>) that any trade, manual or automated, can be placed in the market by using an order: an instruction to the broker (or any other intermediary) to buy or sell. What could be simpler? However, the reality is always more complex. You may want to trade at a certain price, no worse than a certain price, no more than a specified amount of pips (points) from a certain price, and so on. Besides that, in the real market, there is real liquidity, which is always very far from infinite, so you may have your orders rejected, filled partially, or executed at the <em class="italic">wrong</em> prices, and many more unexpected and undesired things may happen if you are not prepared.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time we learn about the main types of orders typically supported by most FX liquidity pools, consider the difference in execution depending on the order type, understand the choice of order types depending on the goal, and get prepared to outline the architecture of an order simulation engine, which imitates possible execution issues and, along with the trade logic, helps you test and improve your strategy to fit the real-life conditions before putting real money at stake.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order ticket – what you send is what you get</li>
<li>Market orders – the way to get maximum control over transactional risk</li>
<li>Limit orders – guaranteed price, but not execution</li>
<li>Time in force – better control over execution</li>
<li>Stop orders – maximum uncontrolled risk</li>
<li>Compound orders</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Order ticket – what you send is what you get</h1>
<p>Let’s start with drafting a prototype of a general order ticket – something that is sent to a trading venue.</p>
<p>Normally, orders are sent either as FIX messages (see <a href="B19145_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Trading Application – What’s Inside?</em>) or in JSON format according to the venue’s specifications. As we also noted in <a href="B19145_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, every venue has its own data and ordering interfaces, but the core properties of an order always remain the same.</p>
<p>Actually, the list of these properties is quite logical. Let’s prepare an empty form and fill in its fields one by one.</p>
<p>First, each order should go out with an ID. Otherwise, how do we or the trading venue refer to it? If we trade live, then the trading venue will generate an order ID that we receive, but if we run a backtest and want to modify orders that had been sent earlier, we need an internally generated order ID. Anyway, number one in our order form is <strong class="bold">Order ID</strong>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure ﻿10.1 – The first attribute of an order is Order ID" src="img/B19145_10_01.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.1 – The first attribute of an order is Order ID</p>
<p>Next, we need to let the venue know which market we want to trade in. As always, please keep in mind that every trading venue has its own specification. For example, EURUSD can be sent as <em class="italic">EURUSD</em>, <em class="italic">EUR/USD</em>, <em class="italic">eur-usd</em>, and so on. So, check the venue’s documentation before actually sending orders. Let’s add the second record to the order ticket – <strong class="bold">Instrument ID</strong>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure ﻿10.2 – Instrument ID added" src="img/B19145_10_02.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.2 – Instrument ID added</p>
<p>We also need to specify the amount we want to trade or the trading size. The trading size can be specified in lots (again, refer to the venue’s documentation regarding how much one lot is) or just in money.</p>
<p>For example, with LMAX, an order to buy 1 lot of EUR USD would mean buying 1,000 euros and selling the respective amount of the US dollars, and with Interactive Brokers, an order to sell 100,000 USD JPY would mean actually selling 100,000 USD and buying the respective amount of the Japanese yen. Be careful when specifying the order size! Now, our order ticket consists of three records:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure ﻿10.3 – Trading size specified in the order" src="img/B19145_10_03.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.3 – Trading size specified in the order</p>
<p>And of course, we should specify the side of the trade: whether we want to buy or sell. Some venues just use <em class="italic">BUY</em> and <em class="italic">SELL</em> specifiers, while others suggest using <em class="italic">BID</em> and <em class="italic">ASK</em> to denote the side, so as you can see, the advice to consult the venue’s documentation is the only stable thing in algo trading. All in all, now we have four records in the order ticket:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure ﻿10.4 – Specifying the side of the trade" src="img/B19145_10_04.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.4 – Specifying the side of the trade</p>
<p>Are we ready to go? Seems so, but not really. The trading venue expects a few other parameters of our trade to be specified: we should say <em class="italic">how</em> we want the order to be executed, <em class="italic">at which price</em>, and <em class="italic">when</em>. The first of these three extra parameters is called the order type, and we normally distinguish between <em class="italic">market orders</em>, <em class="italic">limit orders</em>, and <em class="italic">stop orders</em>. There are also so-called <strong class="bold">compound</strong> or <strong class="bold">conditional orders</strong>, which essentially are combinations of these basic three order types, but they are not supported by all venues. So we will consider in detail only the three main types of orders.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Market orders – the way to get maximum control over transactional risk</h1>
<p>Let’s start with the most simplistic (at least at first glance) type of order: the market order. A <strong class="bold">market order</strong> is an order to buy or sell a certain amount of an asset at a <strong class="bold">market price</strong>. By market price, we normally assume the best bid or the best ask (see <a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">FX Market Overview from a Developer’s Standpoint,</em> for the explanation of the best bid and ask), and most trading strategy developers test their ideas using only the best bid/ask historical data. So, we can add another record to our order ticket prototype, and this record represents the order type:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure ﻿10.5 – Specifying the order type" src="img/B19145_10_05.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.5 – Specifying the order type</p>
<p>We already saw (see again <a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">FX Market Overview from a Developer’s Standpoint</em>) that liquidity may have a substantial impact on how orders are executed in reality and it is considered quite a frequent situation when a single large order may move the best bid or ask during its execution. So, it’s important to make sure that the order will be executed at a price closest to the last best bid or best ask seen in the order book immediately before sending the order to the market.</p>
<p>Using this order type makes sure that if the order is executed, then you get the exact amount of the traded asset specified in the order. At the same time, it doesn’t guarantee that the average execution price will be the same as the top of the book because this kind of execution method allows buying or selling up to the entire amount currently present in the order book.</p>
<p>For example, let’s have a look back at the example of an order book shown in <a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a> (<em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.1</em> in the <em class="italic">Exchange and order book</em> section). Imagine that we send a market order to buy 1,000 contracts. Will it be executed? Yes, because there are more than 1,000 contracts in the order book. But at which price will it be filled?</p>
<p>The order book at the moment of sending the order had 155 contracts at the best ask price (2,149.25), then 306 contracts at 2,149.50, then 291 contracts at 2,149.75, and 532 contracts at 2,150.0. So our order will consume all liquidity from the first 3 price levels and 248 contracts from the 4th. The resulting average execution price can be calculated using the standard weighted average formula:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Formula_B19145_10_001.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here, <em class="italic">P</em> means the weighted average price, <em class="italic">p</em> denotes the price in the order book, and <em class="italic">q</em> means the quantity, the number of contracts traded at the price, <em class="italic">p</em>. In our example, it will be about 2,149.658, which is quite far from 2,145.25, which used to be the best ask at the moment we fired our order.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of an order being executed at a worse market price or the process of filling the order in parts according <a id="_idIndexMarker680"/>to the present liquidity is called <strong class="bold">slippage</strong>.</p>
<p>So, market orders can be useful when we need to fill the exact trading size, but this also may lead to filling at a price worse than expected. Why then did we say that market orders are <em class="italic">the way to get maximum control over transactional risk</em> in the very title of this section?</p>
<p>The reason is that by using market orders, you can be as granular and as precise with the ordering as possible. Indeed, nothing prevents us from developing an algorithm that would first check the liquidity in the order book and then send orders only of the amount that would not destroy it. In case you need to fill an order with a large size (for example, you work for a financial institution), you can split this order into parts and send multiple market orders in sequence until the entire amount is filled – again, without disturbing the order book too much.</p>
<p>Another <em class="italic">benefit</em>, if I may say so, of using market orders is that this is the only type of order that is accepted <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>by all trading venues without a single exception. Although we are going to consider orders of other types, such as limit and stop, remember that they are not always supported by the venue with which you plan to work.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Possible execution issues</h2>
<p>Besides the liquidity and average price fills just discussed, the main issue with market orders is that <a id="_idIndexMarker682"/>such an order (if sent without a time-in-force specifier – see later in this chapter) will be executed at whatever price is currently present in the market. Yes, 99% of the time, it doesn’t cause real issues as the liquidity is quite sufficient, especially if you trade major currency pairs (those that constitute the US dollar index, see <a href="B19145_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Trading Strategies and Their Core Elements</em>, the <em class="italic">Common FX benchmarks – US dollar index</em> section), but do you remember what happens around the time important economic news is released? Just have a quick look back at <em class="italic">Figure 6</em><em class="italic">.2</em> and <em class="italic">Figure 6</em><em class="italic">.4</em> in <a href="B19145_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Basics of Fundamental Analysis and its Possible Use in FX Trading</em>, and refresh <a id="_idIndexMarker683"/>the US <strong class="bold">non-farm payroll</strong> (<strong class="bold">NFP</strong>) and UK GDP cases: the gaps or the distance in price between just adjacent ticks during such an event may reach dozens of pips.</p>
<p>So, if we consider the US NFP case, and assume that you wanted to sell at 1.0230 with a market order a second before the NFP was released, so the order most likely would have been executed at the first tick after the news release, which was at 1.0210 – 20 pips away from the desired price!</p>
<p>Alright, seems like it’s more or less clear with market orders: we say <em class="italic">buy</em> or <em class="italic">sell</em> and get filled immediately (with or without liquidity-related issues). But what to do if we want to buy or sell <em class="italic">at a certain price</em>, or, to be even more precise, to get our order executed at no worse than a certain price? Well, here comes the limit order.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Limit orders – guaranteed price, but not execution</h1>
<p>In general and brief, a <strong class="bold">limit order</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker684"/>order to buy or sell the specified amount of the asset at the specified price or better.</p>
<p>What does <em class="italic">better</em> mean here?</p>
<p>This means that if I send a limit order to <em class="italic">buy</em> EURUSD at 1.0100, then any price <em class="italic">below</em> 1.0100 will match my order. On the contrary, if I send a limit order to <em class="italic">sell</em> EURUSD at 1.0100, then any price <em class="italic">above</em> this level will match. In other words, by using a limit order, I say that <em class="italic">I am ready to buy or sell at any price no worse than the one specified in </em><em class="italic">the order</em>.</p>
<p>What happens if you send a limit order at a price that is better than the current market price? For example, a <em class="italic">buy limit</em> order at a price that is <em class="italic">below</em> the current ask? Well, it depends on the particular implementation of limit orders used by your broker or execution venue. If you trade at an exchange (for example, if you trade currency futures), then your order will be routed directly into the order book.</p>
<p>If you trade spot or forward contracts, then most likely, such an order will reside in the trading venue’s system until the market price touches the order level and then the order will be converted into a market order. If the market price never reaches the order level, the order may be canceled or may reside in the broker’s order book virtually forever (actually not forever, of course, every broker has their own rules on what to do with <em class="italic">forgotten</em> limit orders).</p>
<p>What happens if we send a limit buy order at a price that is worse than the current market price – for example, a <em class="italic">buy limit</em> order at a price that is <em class="italic">above</em> the current ask? In this case, the order will be executed immediately, and it will start absorbing the liquidity from the order book level by level, pushing the price higher and higher, but <em class="italic">this process will stop as soon as the limit price is hit</em>. Thus, a limit order sent at a price worse than the market can be considered a <em class="italic">market order </em><em class="italic">with protection</em>.</p>
<p>Now we know that besides market orders, we can use limit orders, and in case we use them, we should specify a new field in our order ticket prototype: <em class="italic">order price</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure ﻿10.6 – Price attribute added for stop and limit orders" src="img/B19145_10_06.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.6 – Price attribute added for stop and limit orders</p>
<p>So far, it looks like <a id="_idIndexMarker685"/>limit orders are the best to use in all situations, but is it really true? Of course, as there’s neither a free lunch nor a Holy Grail in trading, limit orders are no panacea to execution issues. Let’s take a deep dive into this domain, as execution issues with limit orders are far less obvious than those of market orders.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Possible execution issues</h2>
<p>While the main execution issue with market orders is that they guarantee the execution itself but do <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>not guarantee the execution price, the main issue with limit orders is exactly the opposite: a limit order guarantees the execution price (just by its definition) but does not guarantee the execution as such.</p>
<p>Indeed, let’s carefully consider both cases: if we send a limit order to be executed at a <em class="italic">better price</em> (that is, a <em class="italic">lower than the current price</em> for a <em class="italic">buy limit</em> and a <em class="italic">higher than the current price</em> for a <em class="italic">sell limit</em>) to an exchange, and if we send such an order to a broker or an ECN.</p>
<p>If we work with an exchange, limit orders go straight into the order book (well, actually not really straight: first they pass the broker’s risk management systems that check whether you have sufficient margin to send such an order, but it doesn’t matter in the current context). However, we should remember that the order book is, in reality, two-dimensional (see <em class="italic">Figure 3</em><em class="italic">.2</em> in <a href="B19145_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor044"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">FX Market Overview from Developer’s Standpoint</em>, in the <em class="italic">Exchange and order book</em> section) and that our order will always be put at the end of the current order queue at the same price level. So, when the market price touches the order level, that is, someone actually traded at the order price, there is no guarantee that the size of that trade was sufficient to match all orders from the same price level – including ours.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">One of the most common mistakes during the research and development phase of an algo trading project is assuming that all limit orders are executed, even if their prices were touched by a single tick. This erroneous assumption often leads to the creation of various <em class="italic">Holy Grails</em> of trading that work only on paper.</p>
<p>If we trade with an FX broker or an ECN, then most likely, our limit order won’t go into any order book <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>and no one will see it except for that same broker – until the market price reaches the order level. At this moment, the limit order is transformed into a market order and actually sent to the market. With this approach, we may suffer from the same disease as when trading with market orders – potentially, it could be executed at a price that is worse than the limit order price, which sounds exactly the opposite of the very definition of a limit order.</p>
<p>There are several workarounds for this issue, and most of these workarounds are implemented by execution venues. Most of them check the liquidity in the order book before actually sending the market order: if the order size exceeds the liquidity at the best bid/ask, then the order is executed only partially, up to the actual available amount. This way, the traditional behavior of a classical exchange order book is imitated.</p>
<p>Sounds disappointing?</p>
<p>Well, in fact, some (not all, unfortunately) execution venues allow for somewhat greater control over the order execution. Checking the liquidity in the order book prior to sending an order is a good practice, but with some trading technology providers, we can also use special conditions, or specifiers, to control the order’s time in force.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Time in force – better control over execution</h1>
<p>The specifiers <a id="_idIndexMarker688"/>mentioned previously are normally called <strong class="bold">time in force</strong> conditions, although, as you will see a bit later in this chapter, for some of them, it is not really obvious or intuitive.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Important disambiguation</p>
<p class="callout">More often than not, these execution method specifiers are referred to as the <strong class="bold">type of order</strong>. This can be found not only in some brokers’ documentation but also in books on trading, and even academic research. So, be very careful when you encounter <em class="italic">type of order</em> or <em class="italic">time in force</em> in any documentation, and make sure you understand what exactly the author had in mind: the type of order as such (market, limit, stop, etc.), the time during which it is valid, or how the order should be executed liquidity-wise!</p>
<p>In the following subsections, we will consider different order specifiers in detail.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Immediate or cancel</h2>
<p>An <strong class="bold">Immediate-or-Cancel</strong> (<strong class="bold">IOC</strong>) instruction <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>attached to a market order means: I want to buy or sell <em class="italic">at most</em> X euros, dollars, lots, contracts, whatever, at the <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>market price (that is, current best bid/ask), but no worse than this price, and <em class="italic">I don’t care if I do not get the entire X euros, dollars, and so on, but only a smaller amount</em>. If there’s not sufficient liquidity to fill my order, then fill in what is available and cancel the rest.</p>
<p>In other words, <em class="italic">with IOC, I prioritize price </em><em class="italic">over size</em>.</p>
<p>For example, I send an IOC market order to buy 1,000,000 EUR USD. The current ask price is 1.01234 and the currently available amount at ask is 500,000. Then, I will get 500,000 EURUSD bought at 1.01234 and the rest of my order (another 500,000) will be canceled.</p>
<p>Using IOC orders is probably the best way to prevent execution at an unwanted price, but you should remember that using it may lead to partial fills – so, your trading algorithm should somehow account for situations of this sort.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Fill or kill</h2>
<p>A <strong class="bold">fill-or-kill</strong> (<strong class="bold">FOK</strong>) instruction <a id="_idIndexMarker691"/>means: I want to buy or sell <em class="italic">exactly X</em> euros, dollars, lots, contracts, and so on <em class="italic">at the market price</em>, but if there is insufficient <a id="_idIndexMarker692"/>liquidity at the best bid/ask to fill the entire order, then do not execute this order at all (or <em class="italic">kill</em> the order).</p>
<p>In other words, <em class="italic">with FOK, I prioritize the integrity of the order over </em><em class="italic">its execution</em>.</p>
<p>In the same example, if I send a market buy FOK order for 1,000,000 EURUSD but there’s only 500,000 at the best ask, then the entire order will be killed (canceled) and no partial fill will be executed.</p>
<p>You may wonder why both IOC and FOK are considered time-in-force specifiers: both assume immediate, instant execution of the order. Well, the answer is probably in the question: with IOC or FOK, we specify that the order should be executed <em class="italic">as quickly as possible</em>; this way, we specify its time in force.</p>
<p>Most execution <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>venues support IOC or FOK only for market orders, but there are some that allow adding IOC or FOK to limit orders as well. This makes <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>sense because some execution venues just convert a limit order into a market one when the limit order’s price is touched by the market, so the market order’s time-in-force specifiers become absolutely valid in such a scenario.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other time-in-force specifiers that give an order a much longer life than IOC or FOK. The most common are <strong class="bold">good for a day</strong> and <strong class="bold">good </strong><strong class="bold">till canceled</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Good for a day (GTD) and good till canceled (GTC)</h2>
<p>Both specifiers assume that the order can be filled in parts and set the time frame during which it can be filled.</p>
<p>A GTD order <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>tries to fill what is available at the best bid/ask and the <a id="_idIndexMarker696"/>remaining will reside in the venue’s order book till the end of the day (that is, 5 P.M. New York time in most cases). Any moment the price returns to the order level, another portion of the order is executed.</p>
<p>A GTC order <a id="_idIndexMarker697"/>behaves in a similar way, but there’s no explicitly <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>specified time until which the order remains actual. The trader should take care of all GTC orders, manually or automatically.</p>
<p>In reality, both specifiers are used with limit orders and simply mean the time during which such an order will remain in force, because if we take all appropriate measures by checking the liquidity, then in most cases, a limit order will be executed instantly.</p>
<p>Now that we are familiar with time-in-force specifiers, it’s time to update our proposed order ticket structure:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure ﻿10.7 – Time in force attribute added" src="img/B19145_10_07.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.7 – Time in force attribute added</p>
<p>So far, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>discussed market (<em class="italic">I buy now</em>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>limit (<em class="italic">I buy at this price or better</em>) orders. But it would be quite <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>logical to suppose that if we have an <em class="italic">at this price or better</em> order, then <a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>there should exist an <em class="italic">at this price or worse</em> order, wouldn’t it? Yes, such an order type does exist, and it’s called the stop order.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Stop orders – maximum uncontrolled risk</h1>
<p>Essentially, a <strong class="bold">stop order</strong> is an <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>order to buy or sell the specified amount of the asset <em class="italic">at the specified price </em><em class="italic">or worse</em>.</p>
<p>You may ask at this point: why on Earth would I want to buy or sell at a price worse than I’d like to?</p>
<p>The answer is very simple: both <em class="italic">better</em> and <em class="italic">worse</em> are just references to where the order price is relative to the current market price.</p>
<p>For example, if the current price of EURUSD is 0.99673 and I send a buy-stop order at 0.9989, then my order will be executed at any price equal to or greater than 0.9989. Similar to limit orders, a stop order will reside in the broker’s order book until the market price touches the order price and then converted into a market order. Note that, unlike limit orders, stop orders are never sent to the order book immediately, even if you trade with an exchange. This is quite natural, in fact: if I send a limit order to the order book, then I improve the liquidity in the market as others may become my counterparties and then I become a liquidity provider to them in a certain sense. But if a stop order had been sent to an order book, it would just immediately match one of the limit orders there and move the price immediately by an unpredictable distance.</p>
<p>Indeed, let’s consider an example. Say we have an order book for EURUSD and the current market price (best bid/ask) is 1.00000/1.00005. There are some limit orders to buy at 0.99999, 0.99998, and so on, and some limit orders to sell at 1.00006, 1.00007, and so on. Now, imagine someone sends a stop order to buy at 1.0020 and this order is sent to the <a id="_idIndexMarker704"/>order book. Of course, sellers (those on the <em class="italic">ask</em> side) will be more than happy to sell at 1.0020 and not at 1.0010 or 1.00008. So, a stop order sent to the order book would trigger the order book level that is the most distant from the current best bid/ask, which is strictly opposite to the very idea of an order book.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Not all execution venues support stop orders. Many institutional liquidity pools support only market and limit orders (and some of them only market orders). So it’s always a good idea to emulate stop orders locally.</p>
<p>So, going back to the question about the reason why we may want to use a stop order, now we understand that we can use it when we want to do one of these two actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the market at a price that is greater than current if we want to buy, and at a price that is less than current if we want to sell.</li>
<li>Exit a position when the price goes against it – that is, with a loss. It happens if the current price is less than the entry price for a long position (buy) or the current price is greater than the entry price for a short position (sell).</li>
</ul>
<p>If we use a stop <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>order to exit from a losing position, then it is called a <strong class="bold">stop-loss order</strong>.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Quite frequently, stop orders are confused with stop-loss orders. However, stop orders can be used to both enter and exit the market, while stop-loss orders are always used only to exit from a losing position. In other words, <em class="italic">stop order</em> is a term with a more broad sense that pertains to general trading, and <em class="italic">stop-loss</em> is a narrow term pertaining to just trade logic. From the trading venue’s standpoint, there is no difference between a stop order used to open a position or to close it, so <em class="italic">stop-loss</em> orders may be mentioned only in a particular broker’s documentation, not that of a trading venue.</p>
<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>we know that stop orders are somewhat <em class="italic">artificial</em> and actually executed as conditional market orders, we can understand the typical issues with their execution.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Possible execution issues</h2>
<p>Of course, the main execution issue with stop orders is similar to that of market orders: the slippage <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>with stop orders is potentially unlimited. If we send a buy-stop order, then it will be executed at any price equal to or greater than the order price. It is similar to a sell-stop order: it will be executed at any price equal to or less than the order price.</p>
<p>Stop orders guarantee execution but do not guarantee the price – and in this sense, they are somewhat similar to market orders. Let’s go back again to <em class="italic">Figure 6</em><em class="italic">.2</em> in <a href="B19145_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Basics of Fundamental Analysis and its Possible Use in FX Trading</em>, which illustrates the sequence of ticks (trades) around the publication of US NFP data. Imagine we have a long position before the news and we set a protective stop (stop-loss) order at 1.02250. With the very first tick after the news release, this stop order will be executed – but not at 1.02250. It will be executed at the first available price, which would be 1.02100 or worse (lower).</p>
<p>Always remember that even if you placed a stop-loss order, it doesn’t mean that you limited your losses by the order’s price level. It can be executed way beyond the requested price, thus increasing the losses.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that some market makers offer <em class="italic">guaranteed stop-loss execution</em>. This means that during an event such as US NFP or a similar situation when the price may jump beyond the stop order price in one tick, they would still execute the order at the requested price, not the market price. Only market makers can do that as it is they who quote the market for you as the price taker. Of course, there’s no free lunch here either, so market makers ask for a premium for this service. Such a premium typically means a wider spread or a greater commission.</p>
<p>Does it make sense to use <em class="italic">guaranteed</em> stop-loss orders? Well, it depends on the trade logic of your model and its statistics. If you use stop orders as a regular means of exiting the position even in a <em class="italic">calm</em> market, then the answer is probably no because you will lose more in spreads and commissions. If you use them only as a protective measure against an unexpected disastrous market price movement, then the answer is probably yes, as such a disastrous movement can ruin your account in one tick – just recall the case of the Swiss National Bank unpegging the rate of CHF from the euro described in <a href="B19145_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Trading Strategies and Their Core Elements</em>, in <em class="italic">Figure 9</em><em class="italic">.6</em>.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, stop orders kept at the broker are mostly used as protective stop-loss orders, which exit from a losing position and cut running losses. If your strategy logic assumes entering the market along with the price movement, which is typical for a breakout strategy, for example, then it’s always a better idea to emulate such a stop order locally and send it to the market as a market or even a limit order to prevent bad execution.</p>
<p>Now, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>suggest the final draft of our general order ticket, which would support all three main types of orders (market, limit, and stop) and all the essential attributes required to send the order to a broker:</p>

<p>Similar to limit orders, IOC and FOK are not used with stop orders, but GTD and GTC are. Besides that, some execution venues offer an additional condition to trigger a stop order, which is to convert a stop order into a market order: whether it’s triggered when the bid or the ask price hits the order level. However, this specifier is not common.</p>
<p>Market, limit, and stop orders are de facto standard orders accepted by almost any trading venue. However, some venues offer other types of orders that are frequently referred to as compound orders, which we will explore in the next section. They are not common and not essential, but it’s worth at least knowing that they exist and how they work in very general terms.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Compound orders</h1>
<p><strong class="bold">Compound orders</strong> are those <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>that assume a certain logical chain in their execution. That’s why <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>they are also referred to as <strong class="bold">conditional orders</strong>. Strictly speaking, such an order is not a single order: it’s a sequence of orders that are triggered one by another.</p>
<p>As the most common example, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>consider a <strong class="bold">stop-limit order</strong>. Unlike stop or limit orders, it requires two prices to be specified: stop and limit. If such an order is sent to the execution venue, first, the venue’s matching engine waits till the stop price of the order is touched by the market (best bid/ask) price. After that, the order is executed using its limit price exactly like when executing a limit order. So, a stop limit order is a combination of both.</p>
<p>For example, if the current price of EUR USD is 1.01015 and I want to buy it at 1.0102, I can use a stop order to enter the market – but I remember that during the execution of a stop order, I can get a potentially unlimited slippage. Therefore, I send a stop limit order with two prices: a stop price of 1.0102 and a limit price of 1.01025. Then, as soon as 1.0102 is touched by the market (this means that either ask or bid becomes equal or greater than 1.0102; see the explanation on special execution conditions for stop orders in the previous section), a limit-buy order at 1.01025 is actually executed. So, I will buy EURUSD at any price between 1.0102 (the stop price) and 1.01025 (the limit price).</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that stop-limit orders are used only to enter the market and never used as stop-loss orders. A stop-loss order must ensure the entire order size is filled, but a stop-limit order, like any limit order, cannot guarantee the execution of the entire order size.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Summary</h1>
<p>Now, we are familiar with orders of the three main types, and we know in which cases we prefer to use market, stop and limit orders, and in which cases we’d rather avoid using them. Besides that, from previous chapters, we remember how to receive and handle market data, and how to use technical analysis, and we remember the key risks and have at least some ideas on how to mitigate them. So, we are ready for the final, ultimate job of any algo trader in the research and development phase: we are about to start drafting a trading application, something that will receive data, process it, generate trading signals, convert them into orders, send the order to the broker, process the broker’s response, and collect the trading statistics, which can ultimately prove or disprove the trading idea. This is what we are going to do in the next chapter.</p>

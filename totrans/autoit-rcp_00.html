It is an organizational transformation that aims to drive process efficiency, consistency, and repeatability. Many business processes, such as HR onboarding, lead management, financial reports, and invoicing, among others, can be easily automated to achieve these goals across the organization using Python modules. </p><p>The Python recipes covered in the chapters of this book will help you gain knowledge and encourage you to think of automating your business flows. With a classical problem-solving pattern, we look at different areas, such as HR, marketing, customer support, and many more, where we can automate and innovate with the help of Python recipes.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

- en: Testing is essential for any activity to succeed; this applies to software as
    well. It not only covers verification but also the validation of the software.
    Commonly used testing practices include unit and functional testing that validates
    the needed functionality. However, manual efforts by testers or stakeholders are
    required to verify that the software being tested works as desired, as part of
    the software acceptance process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As software has grown both in size and amount over the years, the acceptance
    testing process has become automated, leaving behind vast information in the form
    of audit trails of tests that need to be made available to the user at a glance
    and without which the purpose of acceptance test automation is defeated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Robot framework provides this missing link that integrates with the testing
    tool used for performing acceptance testing over the software or the "system under
    test" and structures this execution into discrete structures of tests arranged
    in a proper hierarchical manner; this not only results in execution in the desired
    manner, but also generates orderly reports.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Being an open source framework, this tool does not limit you to simply performing
    acceptance testing in a hierarchical manner and generating automated reports,
    but also allows you to customize it and create your own tool or even use it with
    other tools as part of a custom test environment setup required for your team.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with the Robot Framework"),
    *Getting Started with the Robot Framework*, explains the need for acceptance test
    driven development, offers a high-level overview, and gives different methods
    of installation of the Robot Framework tool. It also discusses the various commands
    available for the user to interact with the framework and demonstrates simple
    test project creation and execution to the user.'

    a Test Project*, explains the test hierarchies and covers the different files
    and tables used in the framework as well as different syntax options to write
    the test files. It explains the commonly used test practices and explains how
    information can be re-used within the tests.'

    Customization*, covers test re-use, connectivity to external data sources and
    test templates, and user-defined keywords. It also provides different test writing
    styles and offers comparison with some other famous behavior-driven test tools.'

    Framework*, demonstrates real-world testing challenges and offers practical ways
    of using various built-in and external libraries to solve these challenges. It
    covers both the Web-based and desktop testing through object-oriented as well
    as image-based tests. In the absence of a compatible testing library, it also
    demonstrates the creation and integration of a custom written library.'

    covers the generated output of the tool in detail and offers different ways to
    customize the reports as well as the logs generated through the built-in as well
    as custom mechanisms. It also encourages the user to leverage the source code
    to create a customized reporting mechanism in the existing framework.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to use the Robot Framework, you first need to install Python (the examples
    have been tested against 2.7, but you are free to use any version between Python
    2.7 or 3), which might be installed if you are using a popular Linux distro or
    Mac OS X as your OS. Apart from Python, you can also install Jython and IronPython
    that can be used to run Python-based applications and tools such as the Robot
    Framework on JDK or .NET Framework runtime. A few examples do require explicit
    use of Jython, but the rest of the available environments can be used with any
    Python-based runtime. To install third party tools, or for easier installation,
    it is recommended to use easy_install Python module. Installations for tools/frameworks
    needed alongside testing with the Robot Framework are provided where necessary.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As this book is focused on a testing tool, it primarily targets the testers.
    However, given the necessities of creating an in-house flexible testing tool,
    a hands-on Python development is also needed to modify and develop a testing framework
    to suit one's needs. Similar to DevOps movement, developers today are seeking
    ways to look beyond test and behavior-driven development, and the testers are
    also required to be more productive through means of automation. In this book,
    you will have to wear both the developer's and tester's hat in various situations
    in order to gain knowledge of this tool's working from both the perspectives.

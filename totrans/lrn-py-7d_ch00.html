<p>Python was initially developed by Guido Von Rossum as a fun project and was named after his favorite show Monty Python's Flying Circus. It was developed in 1991, but it started becoming popular around 2008. A major contributor to this popularity was Google, which has developed a number of platforms using Python. Recently, Python has been popularized by cloud, DevOps, data science, data analytics, machine learning, and natural language processing. With more and more data harvesting and data processing, people want to get into new types of job roles, which require basic programming skills, and Python perfectly suits all the categories of job work. <em>Learn Python in 7 Days</em> has been&#160;designed to give such people an easy way to learn and master the basics of Python in 7&#160;days. The book covers the basic and necessary concepts that are required to understand the working of the Python language. The book is for all types of readers and learners. It also acts as a refresher for experienced people. We believe that we have covered as much as possible for making it a book to be finished in seven&#160;days; however, we believe that merely reading the book is not sufficient to master programming skills. It will take more than that to achieve mastery. We hope you enjoy reading the book and use it as a good learning book.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "<span>The next step is to edit</span> <kbd>build.properties</kbd> <span>file.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>print "Name Marks Age" <br/>print ( "%s %14.2f %11d" % ("John Doe", 80.67, 27)) <br/>print ( "%s %12.2f %11d" %("Bhaskar" ,76.901, 27))<br/>print ( "%s %3.2f %11d" %("Mohit", 56.98, 25)) 
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre> <strong>   $ brew install python</strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Once done, click on <span class="packt_screen">Activate</span>."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>

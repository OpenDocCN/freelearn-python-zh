- en: Django is an open-source Python web framework that encourages rapid development
    and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development
    and presents a relatively shallow learning curve for beginner programmers. Django
    follows Python’s “batteries included” philosophy, shipping with a rich and versatile
    set of modules that solve common web-development problems. The simplicity of Django,
    together with its powerful features, makes it attractive to both novice and expert
    programmers. Django has been designed for simplicity, flexibility, reliability,
    and scalability.

    as Instagram, Spotify, Pinterest, Udemy, Robinhood, and Coursera. It is not by
    coincidence that, over the last few years, Django has consistently been chosen
    by developers worldwide as one of the most loved web frameworks in Stack Overflow’s
    annual developer survey.

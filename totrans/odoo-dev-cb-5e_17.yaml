- en: Odoo has had built-in support for **in-app purchasing** (**IAP**) since version
    11\. IAP is used to provide recurring services without any complex configurations.
    Usually, apps purchased from the app store only require a one-time payment from
    the customer, because they are normal modules and once the user has purchased
    and started using the module, it won’t cost the developer anything. In contrast
    to this, IAP apps are used to provide services to users, and so there is an operational
    cost to providing continuous service. In such cases, it is not possible to provide
    a service with just a single initial purchase. The service provider needs something
    that charges the user in a recurring manner, based on usage. Odoo’s IAP fixes
    these issues and provides a way to charge based on usage.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are three main entities in the IAP process: the customer, the service
    provider, and Odoo itself. These are described as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The customer** is the end user who wants to use the service. In order to
    use the service, the customer needs to install the application provided by the
    service provider. The customer then needs to purchase a service plan according
    to their usage requirements. With that, the customer can start to use the service
    straight away. This prevents difficulties for the customer, as it is not necessary
    to carry out complex configurations. Instead, they just pay for the service and
    start to use it.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**The service provider** is the developer who wants to sell the service (probably
    you, as you are the developer). The customer will ask the provider for the service,
    at which point the service provider will check whether the customer purchased
    a valid plan and whether there is enough credit in the customer’s account. If
    the customer has enough credit, the service provider will deduct the credit and
    provide the service to the customer.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Odoo** itself is a kind of broker in this. It provides a medium for handling
    payments, credits, plans, and so on. Customers purchase the service credit from
    Odoo, and the service provider draws this credit when serving the service. Odoo
    then bridges the gap between the customer and the service provider, so the customer
    has no need to do complex configurations and the service provider has no need
    to set up a payment gateway, customer account management, and so on.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also an optional entity in the process, which is the **external service**.
    In some cases, service providers use some external services. However, we will
    ignore external services here, as they are the secondary service provider. An
    example of this could be an SMS service. If you are providing an SMS IAP service
    to Odoo users, then you (the service provider) will use an SMS service internally.

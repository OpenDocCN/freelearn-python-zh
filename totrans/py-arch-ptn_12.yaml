- en: Designing is an important stage to have a plan of action, but really the meat
    of the developing process is in the implementation.

- en: Implementing the general architecture design will require multiple smaller design
    decisions about how the code needs to be structured and developed. It doesn't
    matter how good the design is, the execution is critical and will validate or
    adjust the prepared plan.

- en: A solid implementation, then, requires developers to be skeptical about their
    own coding abilities and code needs to be tested thoroughly before it can be considered
    "done." This is a normal operation, and when done constantly, it produces good
    cascading effects, not only improving the quality of the code and reducing the
    number of problems but also increasing the capacity of the team to foresee weak
    points and harden them to be sure that, once in operation, the software is reliable
    and works with as few problems as possible.

- en: We will see how to approach testing, including the use of **Test-Driven Design**
    (**TDD**), a practice that puts testing at the center of the development process.

- en: Sometimes some code aspects need to be shared multiple times to be reused. A
    powerful tool in the Python world is the easy creation and sharing of modules
    that can be implemented. We will see how to structure, create, and maintain standard
    Python modules, including uploading them into PyPI, the standard Python repository
    of third-party packages.

- en: For the purposes of this book, you need to install Python and an Integrated
    Development Environment (IDE) on your computer. IDLE and Visual Studio Code are
    examples of such IDEs. It's up to you to choose which one you are going to use.
    If you have decided to use IDLE, then you can skip setting up Visual Studio Code.

- en: '![](img/notice.jpg)If you are unsure which IDE to choose (IDLE or Visual Studio
    Code), the answer is simple. IDLE is light, simple, suitable for novice programmers
    and very easy to install. Visual Studio Code, on the other hand, is more complex,
    suitable for programmers who are a bit more advanced and requires a bit more effort
    to set up.'

    but not necessarily in all of them. For example, in Ubuntu Linux, Python is installed
    by default, but you may need to install the IDLE module separately.'

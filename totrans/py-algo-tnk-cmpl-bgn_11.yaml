    (RAM) where a program can store a value and change it as the program executes.

    thing at a time. Because the box is transparent, you can also see what it contains.
    Also, if you have two or more boxes you can give each box a unique name. For example,
    you could have three boxes, each containing a different number, and you could
    name the boxes numberA, numberB, and numberC.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, you may need to use a value that cannot change while the program
    is running. Such a value is called a constant. In simple terms, a constant can
    be thought of as a locked variable. This implies that when a program begins to
    run, a value is assigned to the constant, and thereafter, nothing can alter that
    value while the program is in progress. For example, in a financial program an
    interest rate can be declared as a constant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A descriptive name for a constant can also improve the readability of your program
    and help you avoid some errors. For example, let's say that you are using the
    value 3.14159265 (but not as a constant) at many points throughout your program.
    If you make a typographic error when typing the number, this will produce the
    wrong results. But, if this value is given a name, any typographical error in
    the name is detected by the compiler, and you are notified with an error message.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certain rules must be followed when you choose a name for your variable or constant.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ►The name of a variable or constant should only consist of Latin characters
    (English uppercase or lowercase characters), numbers, and the underscore character
    ( _ ). Especially for constants, even though lowercase letters are permitted,
    it is advisable to use only uppercase letters. This convention aids in visually
    distinguishing constants from variables. Examples of variable names are firstName,
    lastName1, and age while examples of constant names are VAT, and COMPUTER_NAME.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ►Variable and constant names are case-sensitive, meaning there is a distinct
    difference between uppercase and lowercase characters. For example, myVAR, myvar,
    MYVAR, and MyVar are actually four different names.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ►No space characters are allowed. If a variable or constant name consists of
    more than one word, you can use the underscore character ( _ ) between the words
    or start each word (except the first one) capitalized (Camel Case convention).
    For example, the variable name student first name is incorrect. Instead, you might
    use student_first_name, or even better, studentFirstName.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ►A valid variable or constant name can start with a letter, or an underscore.
    Numbers are allowed, but they cannot be used at the beginning of the name. For
    example, the variable name 1studentName is not properly written. Instead, you
    might use something like studentName1 or student1Name.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ►A variable or constant name is usually chosen in a way that describes the meaning
    and the role of the data it contains. For example, a variable that holds a temperature
    value might be named temperature, temp, or even t.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ►Do not use any of the reserved words of Python as a variable or constant name.
    For example, the name While cannot be a valid variable or constant name since
    it is a reserved word in Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/remember.jpg)Unfortunately, Python does not support constants in the
    same way that some other computer languages do (such as C#, or C++). You can use

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/notice.jpg)The “Camel Case convention” is a style for naming identifiers
    (variables, subprograms, classes etc.) in computer programming. It is called "Camel
    Case" because the capital letters in the middle of the name resemble the humps
    of a camel. There are two main variations of Camel Case: a) Lower Camel Case (or
    Camel Case), where the first letter of the identifier starts with a lowercase
    letter, and the first letter of each subsequent word starts with an uppercase
    letter; and b) Upper Camel Case (or Pascal Case), which is similar to Lower Camel
    Case, but also, the first letter of the identifier starts with an uppercase letter.'

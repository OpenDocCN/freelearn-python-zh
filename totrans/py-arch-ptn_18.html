    <p class="normal">It is quite common that written code doesn't behave perfectly after being tested with real data. Other than bugs, we can find the problem that the performance of the code is not adequate. Perhaps some requests are taking too much time, or perhaps the usage of memory is too high.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">In those cases, it's difficult to know exactly what the key elements are, that are taking the most time or memory. While it's possible to try to follow the logic, normally once the code is released, the bottlenecks will be at points that are almost impossible to know beforehand.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">To get information on what exactly is going on and follow the code flow, we can use profilers to dynamically analyze the code and better understand how the code is executed, in particular, where most time is spent. This can lead to adjustments and improvements affecting the most significant elements of the code, driven by data, instead of vague speculation.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <ul>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Profiling basics</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Types of profilers</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Profiling code for time</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Partial profiling</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Memory profiling</li>&#13;&#13;
    </ul>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">First, we will take a look at the basic principles of profiling.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-260" class="title">Profiling basics</h1>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Profiling is a <a id="_idIndexMarker909"/>dynamic analysis that instruments code to understand how it runs. This information is extracted and compiled in a way that can be used to get a better knowledge of a particular behavior based on a real case, as the code is running as usual. This information can be used to improve the code.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <div>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Certain static analysis tools, as opposed to dynamic, can provide insight into aspects of the code. For example, they can be used to detect if certain code is dead code, meaning it's not called anywhere in the whole code. Or, they can detect some bugs, like the usage of variables that haven't been defined before, like when having a typo. But they don't work with the specifics of code that's actually being run. Profiling will bring specific data based on the use case instrumented and will return much more information on the flow of the code.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The <a id="_idIndexMarker910"/>normal application of profiling is to improve the performance of the code under analysis. By understanding how it executes in practice, it sheds light on the dynamics of the code modules and parts that could be causing problems. Then, actions can be taken in those specific areas.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Performance can be understood in<a id="_idIndexMarker911"/> two ways: either <em class="italic">time performance</em> (how long code takes to execute) or <em class="italic">memory performance</em> (how much memory the code takes to execute). Both <a id="_idIndexMarker912"/>can be bottlenecks. Some code may take too long to execute or use a lot of memory, which may limit the hardware where it's executed.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Tip--PACKT-">We will focus more on time performance in this chapter, as it is typically a bigger problem, but we will also explain how to use a memory profiler.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">A common case in software development is that you don't really know what your code is going to do until it gets executed. Clauses to cover corner cases that appear rare may execute much more than expected, and software works differently when there are big arrays, as some algorithms may not be adequate. </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The problem is that doing that analysis before having the system running is incredibly difficult, and at most times, futile, as the problematic pieces of code will very likely be completely unexpected.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <blockquote class="packt_quote">Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: <strong class="keyword">premature optimization is the root of all evil</strong>. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal" style="text-align: right;">Donald Knuth â€“ Structured Programing with GOTO Statements - 1974.</p></blockquote>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Profiling gives us the ideal tool to <em class="italic">not</em> prematurely optimize, but to optimize according to real, tangible data. The<a id="_idIndexMarker913"/> idea is that you cannot optimize what you cannot measure. The profiler measures so it can be acted upon.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Tip--PACKT-">The famous quote above is sometimes reduced to "premature optimization is the root of all evil," which is a bit reductionist and doesn't carry the nuance. Sometimes it's important to design elements with care and it's possible to plan in advance. As good as profiling (or other techniques) may be, they can only go so far. But it's important to understand, on most occasions, it's better to take the simple approach, as performance will be good enough, and it will be possible to improve it later in the few cases when it's not.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Profiling can be achieved in different ways, each with its pros and cons.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-261" class="title">Types of profilers</h1>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">There are two main kinds of time profilers:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <ul>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Deterministic profilers</strong>, through <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>a process of tracing. A deterministic profiler instruments the code and records each individual command. This <a id="_idIndexMarker915"/>makes deterministic profilers very detailed, as they can follow up the code on each step, but at the same time, the code is executed slower than without the instrumentation.</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Deterministic profilers are not great to execute continuously. Instead, they can be activated in specific situations, like while running specific tests offline, to find out problems.</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet"><strong class="keyword">Statistical profiles</strong>, through<a id="_idIndexMarker916"/> sampling. This kind of profiler, instead of instrumenting the code and detecting each operation, awakes at <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>certain intervals and takes a sample of the current code execution stack. If this process is done for long enough, it captures the general execution of the program. </li>&#13;&#13;
    </ul>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Taking a sample of the stack is similar to taking a picture. Imagine a train or subway hall where people are moving across to go from one platform to another. Sampling is analogous to taking pictures at periodic intervals, for example, once every 5 minutes. Sure, it's not possible to get exactly who comes from one platform and goes to another, but after a whole day, it will provide good enough information on how many people have been around and what platforms are the most popular.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="bullet-para">While they don't give as detailed information as deterministic profiles, statistical profilers are <a id="_idIndexMarker918"/>much more lightweight and don't consume many resources. They can be enabled to constantly monitor live systems without interfering with their performance.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="bullet-para">Statistical profilers <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>only make sense on systems that are under relative load, as in a system that is not stressed, they'll show that most time is spent waiting.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="bullet-para">Statistical profilers can be internal, if the sampling is done directly on the interpreter, or even external if it's a different program that is taking the samples. An external profiler has the advantage that, even if there's any problem with the sampling process, it won't interfere with the program being sampled.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Both profilers can be seen as complementary. Statistical profilers are good tools for understanding the most-visited parts of the code and where the system, aggregated, is spending time. They live in the live system, where the real case usages determine the behavior of the system.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The deterministic profilers are tools for analyzing specific use cases in the petri dish of the developer's laptop, where a specific task that is having some problem can be dissected and analyzed carefully, to be improved.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Tip--PACKT-">In some respects, statistical profilers are analogous to metrics and deterministic profilers to logs. One displays the aggregated elements and the other the specific elements. Deterministic profilers, contrary to logs, are not ideal tools for using in live systems without care, though.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Typically, code will present <em class="italic">hotspots</em>, slow parts of it that get executed often. Finding the specific parts to focus attention on and then act on them is a great way to improve the overall speed.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">These hotspots can be revealed by profiling, either by<a id="_idIndexMarker920"/> checking the <em class="italic">global</em> hotspots using a statistical profiler<a id="_idIndexMarker921"/> or the <em class="italic">specific</em> hotspots for a task with a deterministic profiler. The first will display the specific parts of the code that are most used in general, which allows us to understand the pieces that get hit more often and take the most time in aggregate. The deterministic profiler can show, for a specific task, how long it takes for each line of code, and determine what are the slow elements.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Tip--PACKT-">We won't look at statistical profilers as they require systems that are under load and they are difficult to create in a test<a id="_idIndexMarker922"/> that's fit for the scope of this book. You can <a id="_idIndexMarker923"/>check <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">py-spy</code> (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/py-spy/">https://pypi.org/project/py-spy/</a>) or <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">pyinstrument</code> (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyinstrument/">https://pypi.org/project/pyinstrument/</a>).</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Another kind of profiler<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> is the memory profiler. A memory profiler records when memory is increased and decreased, tracking the usage of memory. Profiling memory<a id="_idIndexMarker925"/> is typically used to find out memory leaks, which are rare for a Python program, but they can happen.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Python has a garbage collector that releases memory automatically when an object is not referenced anymore. This happens without having to take any action, so compared with programs with manual memory assignment, like C/C++, the memory management is easier to handle. The garbage collection mechanism used forÂ Python is called <em class="italic">reference counting</em>, and <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>it frees memory immediately once a memory object is not used by anyone, as compared with other kinds of garbage collectors that wait.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the case of Python, memory leaks can<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> be created by three main use cases, from more likely to least:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <ul>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Some objects are still referenced, even if they are not used anymore. This can typically happen if there are long-lived objects that keep small elements in big elements, like lists of dictionaries when they are added and not removed.</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">An internal C extension is not managing the memory correctly. This may require further investigation with specific C profiling tools, which is out of scope for this book.</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Complex reference cycles. A reference cycle is a group of objects that reference each other, e.g. object A references B and object B references A. While Python has algorithms to detect them and release the memory nonetheless, there's the small possibility that the garbage collector is disabled or any other bug problem. You can see more information<a id="_idIndexMarker928"/> on the Python garbage collector here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html</a>.</li>&#13;&#13;
    </ul>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The most likely situation for extra usage of memory is an algorithm that uses a lot of memory, and detecting when the memory is allocated can be achieved with the help of a memory profiler.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Memory profiling<a id="_idIndexMarker929"/> is typically more complicated and takes more effort than time profiling.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Let's introduce some code and profile it.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-262" class="title">Profiling code for time</h1>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will start <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>by creating a short program that will calculate and display all prime numbers up to a particular number. Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by themselves and one.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will start by taking a naÃ¯ve approach first:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">def check_if_prime(number):&#13;&#13;
    result = True&#13;&#13;
    for i in range(2, number):&#13;&#13;
        if number % i == 0:&#13;&#13;
            result = False&#13;&#13;
    return result&#13;&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">This code will take every number from 2 to the number under test (without including it), and check whether the number is divisible. If at any point it is divisible, the number is not a prime number.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">To calculate all the way from 1 to 5,000, to verify that we are not making any mistakes, we will include the first prime numbers lower than 100 and compare them.

    <p class="normal">We see how time has gone down by a big factor (2 seconds compared with the 12 seconds before, as measured by <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">time</code>) and we see the great reduction in time spent on comparisons (3,749,127 microseconds before, and then 473,788 microseconds), mainly due to the fact <a id="_idIndexMarker950"/>there are 10 times fewer comparisons, 1,563,868 compared with 12,487,503.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We can <a id="_idIndexMarker951"/>also improve and further reduce the number of comparisons by limiting the size of the loop.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Right now, the loop will try to divide the source number between all the numbers up to itself. For example, for 19, we try these numbers (as 19 is a prime number, it's not divisible by any except for itself).</p>&#13;&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Divide 19 between&#13;&#13;
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]&#13;&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Trying all these numbers is not necessary. At least, we can skip half of them, as no number will be divisible by a number higher than half itself. For example, 19 divided by 10 or higher is less than 2.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Divide 19 between&#13;&#13;
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]&#13;&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Furthermore, any factor of a number will be lower than its square root. This can be explained as follows: If a number is the factor of two or more numbers, the highest they may be is the square root of the whole number. So we check only the numbers up to the square root (rounded down):</p>&#13;&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Divide 19 between&#13;&#13;
[2, 3, 4]&#13;&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">But we can reduce it even further. We only need to check the odd numbers after 2, as any even number will be divisible by 2. So, in this case, we even reduce it further.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Divide 19 between&#13;&#13;
[2, 3]&#13;&#13;

</code></pre>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker953"/> code always checks for divisibility by 2, unless the number is 2. This is to keep returning 2 correctly as a prime.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Then, we create a range of numbers that starts from 3 (we already tested 2) and continue until the square root of the number. We use the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">math</code> module to perform the action and to floor the number to the nearest lower integer. The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">range</code> function requires a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">+1</code> of this number, as it doesn't include the defined number.

    <p class="normal">Here, you can see more of the general structure of the code execution. You can see that most of the time is spent on the multiple <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">check_if_prime</code> calls, which comprise the bulk of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">prime_numbers_up_to</code> and the list comprehension included in it, and very little time is spent on <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">extract_params</code>.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">But this<a id="_idIndexMarker968"/> approach has some problems:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <ul>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">First of all, we need to go a full cycle between starting and stopping a process. This is cumbersome to do for requests.</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Everything that happens in the cycle is included. That adds noise to the analysis. Fortunately, we knew that the interesting part was in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">get_result</code>, but that may not be evident. This case also uses a minimal structure but adding that in the case of a complex framework like Django can lead to a lot of .</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">If we process two different requests, they will be added into the same file, again mixing the results.</li>&#13;&#13;
    </ul>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">These problems can be solved by applying the profiler to only the part that is of interest and producing a new file for each request.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-268" class="title">Generating a profile file per request</h2>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">To be able<a id="_idIndexMarker969"/> to generate a different file with information per individual request, we need to create a decorator for easy access. This will profile and produce an independent file.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the file <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">server_profile_by_request.py</code>, we get the same code as in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">server.py</code>, but adding the following decorator.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">from functools import wraps&#13;&#13;

from time import time&#13;&#13;

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):&#13;&#13;
        prof = cProfile.Profile()&#13;&#13;
        retval = prof.runcall(func, *args, **kwargs)&#13;&#13;
        filename = f'profile-{time()}.prof'&#13;&#13;
        prof.dump_stats(filename)&#13;&#13;
        return retval&#13;&#13;
    return wrapper&#13;&#13;
</code></pre>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The decorator defines a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">wrapper</code> function that replaces the original function. We use the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">wraps</code> decorator to keep the original name and docstring.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">This is just a standard decorator process. A decorator function in Python is one that returns a function that then replaces the original one. As you can see, the original function <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">func</code> is still called inside the wrapper that replaces it, but it adds extra functionality.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Inside, we<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> start a profiler and run the function under it using the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">runcall</code> function.

    <p class="normal">Each file contains only the information from <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">get_result</code> onwards, which gets information only up to a point. Even more so, each file displays information only for a specific request, so it can be profiled individually, with a high level of detail.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/> code can be adapted to adapt the filename more specifically to include details like call parameters, which can be useful. Another interesting possible adaptation is to create a random sample, so only 1 in X calls produces profiled code. This can help reduce the overhead of profiling and allow you to completely profile some requests.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Tip--PACKT-">This is different from a statistical profiler, as it will still completely profile some requests, instead of detecting what's going on at a particular time. This can help follow the flow of what happens for particular requests.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Next, we'll see how to perform memory profiling.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-269" class="title">Memory profiling</h1>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Sometimes, applications <a id="_idIndexMarker974"/>use too much memory. The worst-case scenario is that they use more and more memory as time goes by, normally due to what's called a memory leak, maintaining memory that is no longer used, due to some mistake in the coding. Other problems can also include the fact that the usage of memory may be improved, as it's a limited resource.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">To profile memory and analyze what the objects are that use the memory, we need first to create some example code. We will generate enough Leonardo numbers.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Leonardo numbers <a id="_idIndexMarker975"/>are numbers that follow a sequence defined as the following:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <ul>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">The first Leonardo number is one</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">The second Leonardo number is also one</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="bullet">Any other Leonardo number is the two previous Leonardo numbers plus one</li>&#13;&#13;
    </ul>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Leonardo numbers are similar to Fibonacci numbers. They are actually related to them. We use them instead of Fibonacci to show more variety. Numbers are fun!</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We present the first 35 Leonardo numbers by creating a recursive function and store it in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">leonardo_1.py</code>, available<a id="_idIndexMarker976"/> on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Architecture-Patterns/blob/main/chapter_14_profiling/leonardo_1.py">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Architecture-Patterns/blob/main/chapter_14_profiling/leonardo_1.py</a>.</p>&#13;&#13;

    <p class="normal">In this <a id="_idIndexMarker984"/>case, we see how the memory remains stable at around the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">38 MiB</code>, that we see is the minimum. In this case, note how there are no increments or decrements. Really what happens here is that increments and decrements are too small to be noticed. Because they cancel each other, the report is close to zero.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">memory-profiler</code> module is also able to perform more actions, including showing the usage of memory based on time and plotting it, so you can see memory increasing or decreasing over time.

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-272" class="title">Summary</h1>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we described what profiling is and when it's useful to apply it. We described that profiling is a dynamic tool that allows you to understand how code runs. This information is useful in understanding the flow in a practice situation and being able to optimize the code with that information. Code can be optimized normally to execute faster, but other alternatives are open, like using fewer resources (normally memory), reducing external accesses, etc.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We described the main types of profilers: deterministic profilers, statistical profilers, and memory profilers. The first two are mostly oriented toward improving the performance of code and memory profilers analyze the memory used by the code in execution. Deterministic profilers instrument the code to detail the flow of the code as it's executed. Statistical profilers sample the code at periodic times to provide a general view of the parts of the code that are executed more often.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We then showed how to profile the code using deterministic profilers, presenting an example. We analyzed it first with the built-in module <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">cProfile</code>, which gives a function resolution. We saw how to use graphical tools to show the results. To dig deeper, we used the third-party module <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">line-profiler</code>, which goes through each of the code lines. Once the flow of the code is understood, it is optimized to greatly reduce its execution time.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">The next step was to see how to profile a process intended to keep running, like a web server. We showed the problems with trying to profile the whole application in these cases and described how we can profile each individual request instead forÂ clarity.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p>&#13;&#13;
      <p class="Tip--PACKT-">These techniques are also applicable to other situations like conditional profiling, profiling in only certain situations, like at certain times or one of each 100 requests.</p>&#13;&#13;
    </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">Finally, we also presented an example to profile memory and see how it's used by using the module <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">memory-profiler</code>.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will learn more details about how to find and fix problems in code, including in complex situations, through debugging techniques.</p>&#13;&#13;

<h3 id="toc_1">12.1 Writing Complex Mathematical Expressions</h3>
<p class="my_basic">In <a href="chapter07.html#toc_2">Section 7.2</a> you learned all about arithmetic operators but little about how to use them and how to write your own complex mathematical expressions. In this chapter, you are going to learn how easy is to convert mathematical expressions to Python statements.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>Arithmetic operators follow the same precedence rules as in mathematics, which means that exponentiation is performed first, multiplication and division are performed next, and addition and subtraction are performed last. Moreover, when multiplication and division co-exist in the same expression, and since both are of the same precedence, these operations are performed left to right.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/remember.jpg"/>The exponentiation operator ( ** ) serves a dual role. Apart from being used to calculate the power of a value raised to another value, it is also used to compute any root of a number using the known mathematical formula <img alt="Image" class="height2" src="img/chapter07-05.png"/>. For example, you can write  y = x ** (1 / 3) to calculate the cubic root of x or y = x ** (1 / 5) to calculate the fifth root of x.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">Exercise 12.1-1 Representing Mathematical Expressions in Python</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Which of the following Python statements correctly represent the following mathematical expression?</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="height4" src="img/chapter12-01.png"/></p>
<p>i)x = 1 * 27 / 10 + z</p>
<p>ii)x = 1 · 27 / (10 + z)</p>
<p>iii)x = 27 / 10 + z</p>
<p>iv)x = 27 / (10 + z)</p>
<p>v)x = (1 / 10 + z) * 27</p>
<p>vi)x = 1 / ((10 + z) * 27)</p>
<p>vii)x = 1 / (10 + z) * 27</p>
<p>viii)x = 1 / (10 + z) / 27</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p>i)Wrong. Since the multiplication and the division are performed before the addition, this is equivalent to <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter12-02.png"/>.</p>
<p>ii)Wrong. An asterisk must have been used for multiplication.</p>
<p>iii)Wrong. Since the division is performed before the addition, this is equivalent to <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter12-03.png"/>.</p>
<p>iv)Correct. This is equivalent to <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter12-04.png"/>.</p>
<p>v)Wrong. Inside parentheses, the division is performed before the addition. This is equivalent to <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter12-05.png"/>.</p>
<p>vi)Wrong. Parentheses are executed first and this is equivalent to <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter12-06.png"/></p>
<p>vii)Correct. Division is performed before multiplication (left to right). The term <img alt="Image" class="height3" src="img/chapter12-07.png"/> is calculated first and then, the result is multiplied by 27.</p>
<p>viii)Wrong. This is equivalent to <img alt="Image" class="height4" src="img/chapter12-08.png"/></p>

<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">First, you must distinguish between the data input and the output result. Obviously, the output result is assigned to y and the user must enter values for x and z. The solution for this exercise is shown here.</p>

<h4 id="toc_4">Exercise 12.1-3 Writing a Complex Mathematical Expression in Python</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that calculates the mathematical expression</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width11" src="img/chapter12-10.png"/></p>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Assume that the user enters only positive values for x, w, and z.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Oops! Now the expression is more complex! In fact, it is much more complex! So, let's take a look at a quite different approach. The main idea is to break the complex expression into smaller, simpler expressions and assign each sub-result to temporary variables. In the end, you can build the original expression out of all these temporary variables! This approach is presented next.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_12.1-3a</div>
<div><p>x = float(input())</p>
<p>w = float(input())</p>
<p>z = float(input())</p>
<div></div>
<p>temp1 = 3 * x ** 2 + 5 * x + 2</p>
<p>temp2 = 7 * w + 1 / z</p>
<p>temp3 = (3 + x) / 7</p>
<p>nominator = 5 * temp1 / temp2 + z</p>
<p>denominator = 4 * temp3</p>
<div></div>
<p>y = nominator / denominator</p>
<p>print("The result is:", y)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">You may say, “Okay, but I wasted so many variables and as everybody knows, each variable is a portion of main memory. How can I write the original expression in one single line and waste less memory?”</p>
<p class="my_basic">This job may be a piece of cake for an advanced programmer, but what about you? What about a novice programmer?</p>
<p class="my_basic">The next method will help you write even the most complex mathematical expressions without any syntax or logic errors! The rule is very simple. “After breaking the complex expression into smaller, simpler expressions and assigning each sub-result to temporary variables, start backwards and replace each variable with its assigned expression. Be careful though! When you replace a variable with its assigned expression, you must always enclose the expression in parentheses!”</p>
<p class="my_basic">Confused? Don't be! It's easier in action. Let's try to rewrite the previous Python program. Starting backwards, replace variables nominator and denominator with their assigned expressions. The result is</p>
<p class="my_basic"><img alt="Image" class="height7" src="img/chapter12-11.png"/></p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note the extra parentheses added.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now you must replace variables temp1, temp2, and temp3 with their assigned expressions, and the one-line expression is complete!</p>
<p class="my_basic"><img alt="Image" class="height7" src="img/chapter12-12.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">It may look scary at the end but it wasn't that difficult, was it?</p>
<p class="my_basic">The Python program can now be rewritten</p>

- en: Getting started with full stack development using Python or JavaScript can be
    daunting, mainly if you are a developer already using one of these languages and
    want to add a second language to your set of skills. If you are a developer already
    working with Django or React, or a developer with knowledge in Python or JavaScript
    and you want to learn how to build a full stack application from scratch with
    features such as authentication, CRUD operations, and a lot more, but you are
    also looking to learn how to deploy web applications on AWS using Docker, this
    book covers everything you need.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will help you to discover the full potential practices while combining
    the dual power of the two most popular frameworks – React and Django. We will
    build full stack applications including a RESTful API in the backend and an intuitive
    frontend while exploring the advanced features of both frameworks. We will start
    building a social media web application called Postagram from scratch while covering
    the important concepts, techniques, and best practices for end-to-end development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will see how the dynamic functionality of the React framework can be used
    to build your frontend systems and how the ORM layer of Django helps to simplify
    a database, which in turn boosts the development process of building a backend
    to build full stack applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of the book, you will be able to create a dynamic full stack app
    starting from scratch on your own.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for Python developers who are familiar with Django but don’t know
    where to start when it comes to building a full stack application – more precisely,
    building a RESTful API. You will also find this book useful if you are a frontend
    developer with knowledge of JavaScript and looking to learn full stack development.
    If you are also an experienced full stack developer working with different technologies
    and you are looking to explore and learn new ones, this book is written for you.

    and Django REST. This part provides the knowledge required to connect Django to
    a PostgreSQL database, add authentication using JSON Web Tokens, create RESTful
    resources supporting complex CRUD operations, and add tests to a Django application.
    We will specifically build the backend of a social media web application called
    Postagram with the most common features of a social media application, such as
    post management, comment management, and post likes.

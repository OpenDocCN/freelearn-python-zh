It is one of the powerful and flexible open source languages instilled with powerful libraries. For every python developer, Requests is the library that comes to mind first when he/she needs to interact with the Web. With its batteries included Requests turned the process of interacting with Web a cakewalk and stands as one of the world's best client with more than 42 million downloads.</p><p>With the rise of social media, APIs turn to be a must have part of every application, and interacting with them in the best way possible is going to be a challenge. Getting to know how to interact with APIs, building an API, scraping the web, and such stuff will help every budding web developer to reach new heights.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

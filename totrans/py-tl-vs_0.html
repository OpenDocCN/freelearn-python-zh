Most of the time, this happens without using a comprehensive guide that is available in a complete IDE which is specifically designed for Python development.</p><p>The rare, exceptional IDEs that offer complete guides are often expensive and don't provide hands-on steps to help speed up the development process.</p><p>Visual Studio, as a matured and well-developed tool over the last few decades, has dominated the market of compiled languages and languages that are strictly oriented toward Windows and .NET. Packed with handy tools and functionalities to speed up and facilitate the workflow of developers, it helps users to render repetitive tasks, manage projects, and provide a detailed outlook into the structure of a project. However, most importantly, it helps users gain a clear view into the inner structure of the code.</p><p>In the last few years, Microsoft has started exploring how to integrate new languages into Visual Studio; as a result, Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS) was developed. It's a well-developed tool that is already on its second release and is commonly used by professional developers as their new IDE of choice for Python projects.</p><p>PTVS has everything that a Python developer can dream of: consistent project files management, interactive debugging and code completion features with the rock solid Microsoft IntelliSense technology, project templates, a first-class Django integration package, virtual environment management right in the IDE for REPL, and a native code-based IDE that loads and reacts fast.</p><p>This book will focus more on the integration of Python in Visual Studio than the language itself. It will try to delve into the power offered by the tool and venture into the feasibility of its day-to-day usage for a developer. We will show real examples of how to use PTVS with Django and how to deal with occasional difficulties when it comes to integrating well-known libraries into a Python project on Microsoft Windows.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="Special thanks from the authors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec09"/>Special thanks from the authors</h1></div></div></div><p>Thanks to Packt Publishing for giving us the opportunity to publish this book for the developer community, and the help they have provided during the entire process: from the injection of the idea to the whole process of giving birth to it. It has been a journey filled with surprises and discoveries.</p><p>We'd also like to appreciate our reviewers, Fabio Lonegro and Chris Marinic, who have provided us with clear and unbiased feedback along the way, giving us great insights on untangling the details of the book.</p><p>Last but not least, we would like to thank the Microsoft PTVS team, specifically Steve Dower, who has contributed to the book personally and through providing technical support on every detail. Thanks to Shahrokh Mortazavi for reaching out to us through a tweet (<a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/cathycracks/status/421336498748006400">https://twitter.com/cathycracks/status/421336498748006400</a>). Steve and the rest of the team have given us lots of help, insights, and suggestions on how to overcome some complex but very important parts of the book. They even invited us to visit them in person to gain a greater insight into their work. We truly feel that PTVS is developed by a group of passionate people who care for the community and are eager to develop PTVS to be an even better and useful tool. The Microsoft PTVS team has done a great job with the tool so far in our opinion, and we look forward to what's yet to come.</p><p>We have enjoyed this journey so far, and we are very happy to be doing this together to bring this book to life. It has been an intimate and difficult process filled with love and with some very deep and long discussions into late nights. We hope that you enjoy and gain knowledge from this book as much as we have learned from it.</p><p>We hope that you will find this book interesting and that it will help you discover the inner power of PTVS, as Scott Hanselman described PTVS in a post on his blog, One of Microsoft's Best-Kept Secrets - Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS), created on July 2, 2013 and found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OneOfMicrosoftsBestKeptSecretsPythonToolsForVisualStudioPTVS.aspx">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OneOfMicrosoftsBestKeptSecretsPythonToolsForVisualStudioPTVS.aspx</a>.</p></div></body></html>

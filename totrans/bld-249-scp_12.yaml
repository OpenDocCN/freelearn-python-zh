    development ever since it became open source. Almost every version of Blender
    brought new features—some small and some very sophisticated indeed. The changes
    in Blender''s development are neatly documented on the Blender site at: [http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/](http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/).'

- en: Blender's current, stable version is 2.49 and this version will probably stay
    around for sometime because Blender is no longer 'just' an open source package
    used by 3D enthusiasts but a viable production tool used in different parts of
    the production pipeline by professional studios.

- en: Nevertheless, as of writing this book, the development of a new version of Blender
    is in full swing. The version number, 2.50, may lead you to believe that this
    is just a minor change but in fact, it is almost a complete rewrite. The most
    visible part is a completely different graphical user interface. This interface
    is almost completely written in Python, which opens up endless opportunities for
    writing sophisticated user interfaces to replace the limited possibilities in
    2.49.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not only the user interface is changed but also the internal structure is overhauled
    completely and although most of the functionality exposed in the Python API stays
    similar in nature, there are numerous changes in most of Blender's modules.

- en: One major drawback is that the new version is developed alongside the Durian
    project (which will produce the open source movie "Sintel", see [durian.blender.org](http://durian.blender.org)),
    so the main development goals for version 2.50 are providing all of the functionality
    for this project. This does cover most issues, but some parts, notably Pynodes
    and screen handlers, will not be provided in the first production release.

- en: On the positive side it will no longer be necessary to install a full Pythondistribution
    alongside Blender as the new version will be bundled with a full Python distribution.

    but the timetable mentioned there is of course very preliminary. A full production
    version is expected somewhere late 2010 and will have a version number of 2.6.

- en: The new version of Blender will be bundled with a full Python 3.x distribution
    obviating the need for a separate installation of Python. This version of Python
    is already very stable and it is unlikely that major changes will be implemented
    in the near future.
  prefs: []

- en: Version 3.x is different from version 2.6 but most significant changes are below
    the surface and mostly won't concern a Blender scripter.

- en: 'There is a notable side effect of the new Python version though: many third-party
    packages (that is, Python packages not bundled with the distribution) are not
    (yet) ported to version 3.x. In some situations this might be a considerable nuisance.
    From the packages used in this book the most notable one that is not yet ported
    to version 3.x is PIL (Python Imaging Library). That one is surely missed as it
    provides sophisticated 2D functionality not present in Blender.'

- en: Another package not yet ported to 3.x is Psyco—the just-in-time compiler—but
    Python 3 already is quite a bit faster in many situations so the speed increase
    attainable by a package such as Psyco might not be worth the trouble.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To increase the speed of acceptance of Python 3.x Python's developers have declared
    a moratorium on the addition of new features so that packages developers won't
    have to aim at a moving target. More on this subject can be found at [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3003/](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3003/).

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-775"><a id="_idTextAnchor979"/>In-App Purchasing with Odoo</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor980"/>Odoo has had built-in support for <strong class="bold">in-app purchasing</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAP</strong>) since version 11. IAP is used to provide <a id="_idIndexMarker1210"/>recurring services without any complex configurations. Usually, apps purchased from the app store only require a one-time payment from the customer, because they are normal modules and once the user has purchased and started using the module, it won’t cost the developer anything. In contrast to this, IAP apps are used to provide services to users, and so there is an operational cost to providing continuous service. In such cases, it is not possible to provide a service with just a single initial purchase. The service provider needs something that charges the user in a recurring manner, based on usage. Odoo’s IAP fixes these issues and provides a way to charge based <span class="No-Break">on usage.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">In-app purchases</strong> typically refer to the ability to buy additional features, content, or services within an application. However, Odoo is highly customizable, and while it might not have a dedicated IAP module, you can create similar functionalities using custom development or by leveraging <span class="No-Break">existing modules.</span></p>
			<p>This feature allows users to expand the functionality of their Odoo instance by acquiring additional apps, features, or services without leaving the Odoo environment. Here’s an overview of <span class="No-Break">Odoo IAP:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">App marketplace integration</strong>: Odoo’s IAP is tightly integrated with the Odoo App Store or marketplace. Users can browse, select, and purchase additional apps or modules from a wide range <span class="No-Break">of options.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Easy access to extensions</strong>: Users can access and evaluate the available apps and extensions directly from their Odoo dashboard. This makes it convenient for businesses to extend the capabilities of their Odoo instance without the need for extensive <span class="No-Break">manual installation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Trial versions</strong>: Some apps in the marketplace may offer trial versions or limited-time trials, allowing users to test the functionality of the app before making a purchase. This helps users make <span class="No-Break">informed decisions.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Simplified licensing</strong>: Odoo IAP simplifies the licensing and subscription management for the purchased apps. Users can easily subscribe, renew, or manage their licenses without <span class="No-Break">external processes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">One-click installation</strong>: After purchasing an app, users can typically install it with just one click from within their Odoo instance. This streamlined process reduces the complexity of <span class="No-Break">app installation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Centralized billing</strong>: Billing and payment for the purchased apps are typically managed through Odoo’s central billing system, simplifying the financial aspects of <span class="No-Break">app acquisition.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">App updates</strong>: Odoo IAP often includes automatic updates for purchased apps, ensuring that users have access to the latest features and <span class="No-Break">security updates.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Support and documentation</strong>: Many apps available through Odoo IAP come with documentation and support options, making it easier for users to get assistance <span class="No-Break">if needed.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Integration with core Odoo</strong>: The purchased apps are seamlessly integrated with the core Odoo system, ensuring compatibility and a unified <span class="No-Break">user experience.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are several use cases where you can use IAP, such as a fax service for sending documents or an SMS service. In this chapter, we will explain the Partner autocomplete service that will be provided <span class="No-Break">by Odoo.</span></p>
			<p>In this short chapter, we will cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">IAP concepts</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Buying credits</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">IAP accounts</span></li>
				<li>The <span class="No-Break">IAP portal</span></li>
				<li>Getting notifications for <span class="No-Break">low credits</span><a id="_idTextAnchor981"/></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-776"><a id="_idTextAnchor982"/>IAP concepts</h1>
			<p>IAP involves several key concepts and elements that are essential to understand when using this feature <a id="_idIndexMarker1211"/>within the Odoo ERP system. We will explore the different entities that are a part of the IAP process and also look at the role of each entity and how they combine to complete the <span class="No-Break">IAP process.</span></p>
			<p>Odoo IAP is a valuable tool for businesses using the Odoo ERP system, as it simplifies the process of extending and customizing their software environment. It offers a centralized platform for managing additional apps and modules, helping organizations optimize their business processes and operations. This feature adds a layer of flexibility and scalability to the Odoo ecosystem, making it an even more powerful and adaptable solution for a wide range of businesses <span class="No-Break">and industries.</span></p>
			<p>Odoo IAP simplifies the process of discovering, acquiring, and installing additional apps and modules directly from the Odoo environment. Users can extend the functionality of their Odoo system with ease, without leaving <span class="No-Break">the platform.</span></p>
			<p>App developers can offer their products with various pricing models, including one-time purchases, subscription plans, and trial versions. This flexibility caters to diverse <span class="No-Break">customer needs.</span></p>
			<p>Odoo’s IAP feature significantly enhances the Odoo ERP system’s adaptability and customization capabilities. It streamlines the process of app acquisition, encourages developer innovation, and offers a user-centric experience, ultimately contributing to the platform’s versatility and value for businesses across <span class="No-Break">various industries<a id="_idTextAnchor983"/>.</span></p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-778"><a id="_idTextAnchor985"/>How it works…</h2>
			<p>There are three main entities in the IAP process: the customer, the service provider, and Odoo itself. These are described <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">The customer</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker1213"/>end user who wants to use the service. In order to use the service, the customer needs to install the application provided by the service provider. The customer then needs to purchase a service plan according to their usage requirements. With that, the customer can start to use the service straight away. This prevents difficulties for the customer, as it <a id="_idIndexMarker1214"/>is not necessary to carry out complex configurations. Instead, they just pay for the service and start to <span class="No-Break">use it.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The service provider</strong> is the developer who wants to sell the service (probably you, as you are the developer). The customer will ask the provider for the service, at which <a id="_idIndexMarker1215"/>point the service provider will check whether the customer purchased a valid plan and whether there is enough credit in the customer’s account. If the customer has enough credit, the service provider will deduct the credit and provide the service to <span class="No-Break">the customer.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Odoo</strong> itself is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1216"/>kind of broker in this. It provides a medium for handling payments, credits, plans, and so on. Customers purchase the service credit from Odoo, and the service provider draws this credit when serving the service. Odoo then bridges the gap between the customer and the service provider, so the customer has no need to do complex configurations and the service provider has no need to set up a payment gateway, customer account management, and <span class="No-Break">so on.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is also an optional entity in the process, which is the <strong class="bold">external service</strong>. In some cases, service providers use some external services. However, we will ignore external services here, as they are the secondary service provider. An example of this could be an SMS service. If you are providing an SMS IAP service to Odoo users, then you (the service provider) will use an SMS <span class="No-Break">service inter<a id="_idTextAnchor986"/>nally.</span></p>
			<h3>Buying credits</h3>
			<p>Each IAP service <a id="_idIndexMarker1217"/>has its own pricing. Customers have to buy that service from the IAP service provider. To check your services, go to <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Odoo IAP</strong> | <strong class="bold">View </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">My Services</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h3>IAP accounts</h3>
			<p>Once you buy <a id="_idIndexMarker1219"/>credits from the provider, it is stored on IAP accounts, which are to be used for each service. By default, IAP accounts are common for all companies but can be configured to <span class="No-Break">be company-specific.</span></p>
			<p>To create a new <strong class="bold">IAP Account</strong>, activate the developer mode and go to <strong class="bold">Technical Settings</strong> | <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">IAP Account</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>

			<h3>The IAP portal</h3>
			<p>The IAP portal is a platform where you can see your IAP services and their credits and can recharge <a id="_idIndexMarker1221"/>them by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Buy Credit</strong> button, which will redirect you to the IAP portal. can be set Threshold once it reaches you will get notified via mentioned <span class="No-Break">email ID.</span></p>

			<h3>Get low credits notification</h3>
			<p>Here, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker1222"/>set credits in <strong class="bold">Threshold</strong>, which means we have to set a minimum credit limit and email address. Once it reaches the limit, an automatic reminder will be sent to the mentioned email ID go to <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Odoo IAP</strong> | <strong class="bold">View My Services</strong>. Next, unfold the service, check the credits, and configure <span class="No-Break">it accordingly.</span></p>

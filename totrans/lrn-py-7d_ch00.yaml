- en: Python was initially developed by Guido Von Rossum as a fun project and was
    named after his favorite show Monty Python's Flying Circus. It was developed in
    1991, but it started becoming popular around 2008\. A major contributor to this
    popularity was Google, which has developed a number of platforms using Python.
    Recently, Python has been popularized by cloud, DevOps, data science, data analytics,
    machine learning, and natural language processing. With more and more data harvesting
    and data processing, people want to get into new types of job roles, which require
    basic programming skills, and Python perfectly suits all the categories of job
    work. *Learn Python in 7 Days* has been designed to give such people an easy way
    to learn and master the basics of Python in 7 days. The book covers the basic
    and necessary concepts that are required to understand the working of the Python
    language. The book is for all types of readers and learners. It also acts as a
    refresher for experienced people. We believe that we have covered as much as possible
    for making it a book to be finished in seven days; however, we believe that merely
    reading the book is not sufficient to master programming skills. It will take
    more than that to achieve mastery. We hope you enjoy reading the book and use
    it as a good learning book.

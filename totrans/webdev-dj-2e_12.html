		</div>
		<div><p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter introduces <strong class="bold">REST APIs</strong> and <strong class="bold">Django REST Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">DRF</strong>). You will start by implementing a simple API for the Bookr project. Next, you will learn about the serialization of model instances, which is a key step in delivering data to the frontend side of Django applications. You will explore different types of API views, including both functional and class-based types. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to implement custom API endpoints, including simple authentication.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-339"><a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we learned about templates and class-based views. These concepts greatly help expand the range of functionalities we can provide to the user on the frontend (that is, in their web browser). However, that is not sufficient to build a modern web application. Web apps typically have the frontend built with an entirely separate library, such as <strong class="bold">ReactJS</strong> or <strong class="bold">AngularJS</strong>. These libraries provide powerful tools for building dynamic user interfaces; however, they do not communicate directly with our backend Django code or database. The frontend code simply runs in the web browser and does not have direct access to any data on our backend server. Therefore, we need to create a way for these applications to "talk" to our backend code. One of the best ways to do this in Django is by using REST APIs.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">API</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Application Programming Interface</strong>. APIs are used to facilitate interaction between different pieces of software, and they communicate using <strong class="bold">HTTP</strong> (<strong class="bold">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>). This is the standard protocol for communication between servers and clients and is fundamental to information transfer on the web. APIs receive requests and send responses in HTTP format.</p>
			<p>In our use case in this chapter, an API will help facilitate interaction between our Django backend, and our frontend JS code. For example, imagine that we want to create a frontend application that allows users to add new books to the Bookr database. The user's web browser would send a message (an HTTP request) to our API to say that they want to create an entry for a new book, and perhaps include some details about the book in that message. Our server would send back a response to report on whether the book was successfully added or not. The web browser would then be able to display to the user the outcome of their action.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-340"><a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>REST APIs</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">REST</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Representational State Transfer</strong>. Most modern web APIs can be classified as REST APIs. REST APIs are simply a type of API that focuses on communicating and synchronizing the <em class="italic">state</em> of objects between the database server and frontend client. </p>
			<p>For example, imagine that you are updating your details on a website for which you are signed into your account. When you go to the account details page, the web server tells your browser about the various details attached to your account. When you change the values on that page, the browser sends back the updated details to the web server and tells it to update these details on the database. If the action is successful, the website will show you a confirmation message.</p>
			<p>This is a very simple example of what is known as <strong class="bold">decoupled</strong> architecture between frontend and backend systems. Decoupling allows greater flexibility and makes it easier to update or change components in your architecture. So, let's say you want to create a new frontend website. In such a case, you don't have to change the backend code at all, as long as your new frontend is built to make the same API requests as the old one.</p>
			<p>REST APIs are <em class="italic">stateless</em>, which means that neither the client nor the server stores any states in-between to do the communication. Every time a request is made, the data is processed, and a response is sent back without having to store any intermediate data by the protocol itself. What this means is that the API is processing each request in isolation. It doesn't need to store information regarding the session itself. This is in contrast to a stateful protocol (such as <strong class="bold">TCP</strong>), which maintains information regarding the session during its life.</p>
			<p>So, a <strong class="bold">RESTful web service</strong>, as the name suggests, is a collection of REST APIs used to carry out a set of tasks. For example, if we develop a set of REST APIs for the Bookr application to carry out a certain set of tasks, then we can call it a RESTful web service.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-341"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Django REST Framework</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Django REST Framework</strong>, also called <strong class="bold">DRF</strong> for short, is an open-source Python library that can be used to develop REST APIs for a Django project. DRF has most of the necessary functionality built in to help develop APIs for any Django project. Throughout this chapter, we will be using it to develop APIs for our Bookr project.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-342"><a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>Installation and Configuration</h2>
			<p>Install <code>djangorestframework</code> in the <code>virtual env</code> setup along with PyCharm. Enter the following code in your Terminal app or Command Prompt to do this:</p>
			<pre>pip install djangorestframework</pre>
			<p>Next, open the <code>settings.py</code> file and add <code>rest_framework</code> to <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> as shown in the following snippet:</p>
			<pre>INSTALLED_APPS = ['django.contrib.admin',\
                  'django.contrib.auth',\
                  ‹django.contrib.contenttypes›,\
                  'django.contrib.sessions',\
                  'django.contrib.messages',\
                  'django.contrib.staticfiles',\
                  <strong class="bold">‹rest_framework›</strong>,\
                  ‹reviews›]</pre>
			<p>You are now ready to start using DRF to create your first simple API.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-343"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>Functional API Views</h2>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">URL Mapping, Views, and Templates</em>, we learned about simple functional views that take a request and return a response. We can write similar functional views using DRF. However, note that class-based views are more commonly used, and will be covered next. A functional view is created by simply adding the following decorator onto a normal view, as follows:</p>
			<pre>from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
@api_view
def my_view(request):
     ...</pre>
			<p>This decorator takes the functional view and turns it into a subclass of the DRF <code>APIView</code>. It's a quick way to include an existing view as part of your API.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-344"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Exercise 12.01: Creating a Simple REST API</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will create your first REST API using DRF and implement an endpoint using a functional view. You will create this endpoint to view the total number of books in the database:</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You'll need to have DRF installed on your system to proceed with this exercise. If you haven't already installed it, make sure you refer to the section titled <em class="italic">Installation and Configuration</em> earlier in this chapter.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create <code>api_views.py</code> in the <code>bookr/reviews</code> folder.<p>REST API views work like Django's conventional views. We could have added the API views, along with the other views, in the <code>views.py</code> folder. However, having our REST API views in a separate file will help us maintain a cleaner code base. </p></li>
				<li>Add the following code in <code>api_views.py</code>:<pre>from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .models import Book
@api_view()
def first_api_view(request):
    num_books = Book.objects.count()
    <code>api_view</code> decorator, which will be used to convert our functional view into one that can be used with DRF, and the second line imports <code>Response</code>, which will be used to return a response.</p><p>The <code>view</code> function returns a <code>Response</code> object containing a dictionary with the number of books in our database (see the highlighted part).</p><p>Open <code>bookr/reviews/urls.py</code> and import the <code>api_views</code> module. Then, add a new path to the <code>api_views</code> module in the URL patterns that we have developed throughout this course, as follows:</p><pre>from . import views, api_views
urlpatterns = [path('api/first_api_view/)',\
               path(api_views.first_api_view)
    …
]</pre><p>Start the Django service with the <code>python manage.py runserver</code> command and go to <code>http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/first_api_view/</code> to make your first API request. Your screen should appear as in <em class="italic">Figure 12.1</em>:</p><div><img src="img/B15509_12_01.jpg" alt="Figure 12.1: API view with the number of books&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.1: API view with the number of books</p><p>Calling this URL endpoint made a default <code>GET</code> request to the API endpoint, which returned a JSON key-value pair <code>("num_books": 0</code>). Also, notice how DRF provides a nice interface to view and interact with the APIs.</p></li>
				<li>We could also use the Linux <code>curl</code> (client URL) command to send an HTTP request as follows:<pre>curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/first_api_view/
{"num_books":0}</pre><p>Alternatively, if you are using Windows 10, you can make an equivalent HTTP request with <code>curl.exe</code> from Command Prompt as follows:</p><pre>curl.exe http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/first_api_view/</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we learned how to create an API view using DRF and a simple functional view. We will now look at a more elegant way to convert between information stored in the database and what gets returned by our API using serializers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-345"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>Serializers</h1>
			<p>By now, we are well versed in the way Django works with data in our application. Broadly, the columns of a database table are defined in a class in <code>models.py</code>, and when we access a row of the table, we are working with an instance of that class. Ideally, we often just want to pass this object to our frontend application. For example, if we wanted to build a website that displayed a list of books in our Bookr app, we would want to call the <code>title</code> property of each book instance to know what string to display to the user. However, our frontend application knows nothing about Python and needs to retrieve this data through an HTTP request, which just returns a string in a specific format.</p>
			<p>This means that any information translated between Django and the frontend (via our API) must be done by representing the information in <strong class="bold">JavaScript Object Notation</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSON</strong>) format. JSON objects look similar to a Python dictionary, except there are some extra rules that constrict the exact syntax. In our previous example in <em class="italic">Exercise 12.01</em>, <em class="italic">Creating a Simple REST API</em>, the API returned the following JSON object containing the number of books in our database:</p>
			<pre>{"num_books": 0}</pre>
			<p>But what if we wanted to return the full details about an actual book in our database with our API? DRF's <code>serializer</code> class helps to convert complex Python objects into formats such as JSON or XML so that they can be transmitted across the web using the HTTP protocol. The part of DRF that does this conversion is named <code>serializer</code>. Serializers also perform deserialization, which refers to converting serialized data back into Python objects, so that the data can be processed in the application. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-346"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Exercise 12.02: Creating an API View to Display a List of Books</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will use serializers to create an API that returns a list of all books present in the <code>bookr</code> application:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create a file named <code>serializers.py</code> in the <code>bookr/reviews</code> folder. This is the file where we will place all the serializer code for the APIs.</li>
				<li>Add the following code to <code>serializers.py</code>:<pre>from rest_framework import serializers
class PublisherSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    name = serializers.CharField()
    website = serializers.URLField()
    email = serializers.EmailField()
class BookSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    title = serializers.CharField()
    publication_date = serializers.DateField()
    isbn = serializers.CharField()
    publisher = PublisherSerializer()</pre><p>Here, the first line imports the serializers from the <code>rest_framework</code> module. </p><p>Following the imports, we have defined two classes, <code>PublisherSerializer</code> and <code>BookSerializer</code>. As the names suggest, they are serializers for the <code>Publisher</code> and <code>Book</code> models respectively. Both these serializers are subclasses of <code>serializers.Serializer</code> and we have defined field types for each serializer such as <code>CharField</code>, <code>URLField</code>, and <code>EmailField</code>, and so on.</p><p>Look at the <code>Publisher</code> model in the <code>bookr/reviews/models.py</code> file. The <code>Publisher</code> model has <code>name</code>, <code>website</code>, and <code>email</code> attributes. So, to serialize a <code>Publisher</code> object, we need <code>name</code>, <code>website</code>, and <code>email</code> attributes in the <code>serializer</code> class, which we have defined accordingly in <code>PublisherSerializer</code>.  Similarly, for the <code>Book</code> model, we have defined <code>title</code>, <code>publication_date</code>, <code>isbn</code>, and <code>publisher</code> as the desired attributes in <code>BookSerializer</code>. Since <code>publisher</code> is a foreign key for the <code>Book</code> model, we have used <code>PublisherSerializer</code> as the serializer for the <code>publisher</code> attribute.</p></li>
				<li>Open <code>bookr/reviews/api_views.py</code>, remove any pre-existing code, and add the following code:<pre>from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer
@api_view()
def all_books(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    book_serializer = BookSerializer(books, many=True)
    return Response(book_serializer.data)</pre><p>In the second line, we have imported the newly created <code>BookSerializer</code> from the <code>serializers</code> module. </p><p>We then add a functional view, <code>all_books</code> (as in the previous exercise). This view takes a query set containing all books and then serializes them using <code>BookSerializer</code>. T<a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>he <code>serializer</code> class is also taking an argument, <code>many=True</code>, which indicates that the <code>books</code> object is a <code>queryset</code> or a list of many objects. Remember that serialization takes Python objects and returns them in a JSON serializable format, as follows:</p><pre>[OrderedDict([('title', 'Advanced Deep Learning with Keras'), ('publication_date', '2018-10-31'), ('isbn', '9781788629416'), ('publisher', OrderedDict([('name', 'Packt Publishing'), ('website', 'https://www.packtpub.com/'), ('email', 'info@packtpub.com')]))]), OrderedDict([('title', 'Hands-On Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading'), ('publication_date', '2018-12-31'), ('isbn', '9781789346411'), ('publisher', OrderedDict([('name', 'Packt Publishing'), ('website', 'https://www.packtpub.com/'), ('email', 'info@packtpub.com')]))]) …</pre></li>
				<li>Open <code>bookr/reviews/urls.py</code>, remove the previous example path for <code>first_api_view</code>, and add the <code>all_books</code> path as shown in the following code:<pre>from django.urls import path
from . import views, api_views
urlpatterns = [path('api/all_books/'),\
               path(api_views.all_books),\
               path(name='all_books')
    …
]</pre><p>This newly added path calls the view function <code>all_books</code> when it comes across the <code>api/all_books/</code> path in the URL.</p></li>
				<li>Once all the code is added, run the Django server with the <code>python manage.py runserver</code> command and navigate to <code>http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/all_books/</code>. You should see something similar to <em class="italic">Figure 12.2</em>:<div><img src="img/B15509_12_02.jpg" alt="Figure 12.2: List of books shown in the all_books endpoint&#13;&#10;"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.2: List of books shown in the all_books endpoint</p>
			<p>The preceding screenshot shows that the list of all books is returned upon calling the <code>/api/all_books</code> endpoint. And with that, you have successfully used a serializer to return data efficiently in your database, with the help of a REST API. </p>
			<p>Till now, we have been focusing on functional views. However, you will now learn that class-based views are more commonly used in DRF and will make your life much easier.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-347"><a id="_idTextAnchor363"/>Class-Based API Views and Generic Views</h2>
			<p>Similar to what we learned in <em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Advanced Templating and Class-Based Views</em>, we can write class-based views for REST APIs as well. Class-based views are the most preferred way for writing views among developers as a lot can be achieved by writing very little code. </p>
			<p>Just as with conventional views, DRF offers a set of generic views that makes writing class-based views even simpler. Generic views are designed keeping in mind some of the most common operations needed while creating APIs. Some of the generic views offered by DRF are <code>ListAPIView</code>, <code>RetrieveAPIView</code>, and so on. In <em class="italic">Exercise 12.02</em>, <em class="italic">Creating an API View to Display a List of Books</em>, our functional view was responsible for creating a <code>queryset</code> of the objects and then calling the serializer. Equivalently, we could use <code>ListAPIView</code> to do the same thing:</p>
			<pre>class AllBooks(ListAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer</pre>
			<p>Here, the <code>queryset</code> of objects is defined as a class attribute. Passing the <code>queryset</code> through to the <code>serializer</code> is handled by methods on <code>ListAPIView</code>. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-348"><a id="_idTextAnchor364"/>Model Serializers</h2>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Exercise 12.02</em>, <em class="italic">Creating an API View to Display a List of Books</em>, our serializer was defined as follows:</p>
			<pre>class BookSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    title = serializers.CharField()
    publication_date = serializers.DateField()
    isbn = serializers.CharField()
    publisher = PublisherSerializer()</pre>
			<p>However, our model for <code>Book</code> looks like this (note how similar the definitions of the model and serializer appear to be):</p>
			<pre>class Book(models.Model):
    """A published book."""
    title = models.CharField(max_length=70),\
                            (help_text="The title of the book.")
    publication_date = models.DateField\
                      (verbose_name="Date the book was published.")
    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=20),\
                           (verbose_name="ISBN number of the book.")
    publisher = models.ForeignKey(Publisher),\
                                 (on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    contributors = models.ManyToManyField('Contributor'),\
                                         (through="BookContributor")
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title</pre>
			<p>We would prefer not to specify that the title must be <code>serializers.CharField()</code>. It would be easier if the serializer just looked at how <code>title</code> was defined in the model and could figure out what serializer field to use.</p>
			<p>This is where model serializers come in. They provide shortcuts to create serializers by utilizing the definition of the fields on the model. Instead of specifying that <code>title</code> should be serialized using a <code>CharField</code>, we just tell the model serializer we want to include the <code>title</code>, and it uses the <code>CharField</code> serializer because the <code>title</code> field on the model is also a <code>CharField</code>.  </p>
			<p>For example, suppose we wanted to create a serializer for the <code>Contributor</code> model in <code>models.py</code>. Instead of specifying the types of serializers that should be used for each field, we can give it a list of the field names, and let it figure out the rest:</p>
			<pre>from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Contributor
class ContributorSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Contributor
        fields = ['first_names', 'last_names', 'email']</pre>
			<p>In the following exercise, we will see how we can use a model serializer to avoid the duplication of code in the preceding classes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-349">E<a id="_idTextAnchor365"/>xercise 12.03: Creating Class-Based API Views and Model Serializers</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will create class-based views to display a list of all books while using model serializers:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the file <code>bookr/reviews/serializers.py</code>, remove any pre-existing code, and replace it with the following code:<pre>from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Book, Publisher
class PublisherSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Publisher
        fields = ['name', 'website', 'email']
class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    publisher = PublisherSerializer()
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ['title', 'publication_date', 'isbn', 'publisher']</pre><p>Here, we have included two model serializer classes, <code>PublisherSerializer</code> and <code>BookSerializer</code>. Both these classes inherit the parent class <code>serializers.ModelSerializer</code>. We do not need to specify how each field gets serialized, instead, we can simply pass a list of field names, and the field types are inferred from the definition in <code>models.py</code>.</p><p>Although mentioning the field inside <code>fields</code> is sufficient for the model serializer, under certain special cases, such as this one, we may have to customize the field since the <code>publisher</code> field is a foreign key. Hence, we must use <code>PublisherSerializer</code> to serialize the <code>publisher</code> field.</p></li>
				<li>Next, open <code>bookr/reviews/api_views.py</code>, remove any pre-existing code, and add the following code:<pre>from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer
class AllBooks(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer</pre><p>Here, we use the DRF class-based <code>ListAPIView</code> instead of a functional view. This means that the list of books is defined as a class attribute, and we do not have to write a function that directly handles the request and calls the serializer. The book serializer from the previous step is also imported and assigned as an attribute of this class.</p><p>Open the <code>bookr/reviews/urls.py</code> file and modify the <code>/api/all_books</code> API path to include the new class-based view as follows:</p><pre>urlpatterns = [path('api/all_books/'),\
               path(api_views.AllBooks.as_view()),\
               path(name='all_books')]</pre><p>Since we are using a class-based view, we have to use the class name along with the <code>as_view()</code> method.</p></li>
				<li>Once all the preceding modifications are completed, wait till the Django service restarts or start the server with the <code>python manage.py runserver</code> command, and then open the API at <code>http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/all_books/</code> in the web browser. You should see something like <em class="italic">Figure 12.3</em>:<p> </p><div><img src="img/B15509_12_03.jpg" alt="Figure 12.3: List of books shown in the all_books endpoint&#13;&#10;"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.3: List of books shown in the all_books endpoint</p>
			<p>Like what we saw in <em class="italic">Exercise 12.02</em>, <em class="italic">Creating an API View to Display a List of Books</em>, this is a list of all books present in the book review application. In this exercise, we used model serializers to simplify our code, and the generic class-based <code>ListAPIView</code> to return a list of the books in our database.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-350">Act<a id="_idTextAnchor366"/>ivity 12.01: Creating an API Endpoint for a Top Contributors Page</h2>
			<p>Imagine that your team decides to create a web page that displays the top contributors (that is, authors, coauthors, and editors) in your database. They decide to enlist the services of an external developer to create an app in React JavaScript. To integrate with the Django backend, the developer will need an endpoint that provides the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A list of all contributors in the database</li>
				<li>For each contributor, a list of all books they contributed to</li>
				<li>For each contributor, the number of books they contributed to</li>
				<li>For each book they contributed to, their role in the book</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The final API view should look like this:</p>
			<p> </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/B15509_12_04.jpg" alt="Figure 12.4: Top contributors endpoint &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.4: Top contributors endpoint </p>
			<p>To perform this task, execute the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Add a method to the <code>Contributor</code> class that returns the number of contributions made.</li>
				<li>Add <code>ContributionSerializer</code>, which serializes the <code>BookContribution</code> model.</li>
				<li>Add <code>ContributorSerializer</code>, which serializes the <code>Contributor</code> model.</li>
				<li>Add <code>ContributorView</code>, which uses <code>ContributorSerializer</code>.</li>
				<li>Add a pattern to <code>urls.py</code> to enable access to <code>ContributorView</code>.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">The solution to this activity can be found at <a href="http://packt.live/2Nh1NTJ">http://packt.live/2Nh1NTJ</a>.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-351"><a id="_idTextAnchor367"/>ViewSets</h1>
			<p>We have seen how we can optimize our code and make it more concise using class-based generic views. <code>AllBooks</code> view to return a list of all books in the application and the <code>BookDetail</code> view to return the details of a single book. Using viewsets, we could combine both these classes into a single class. </p>
			<p>DRF also provides a class named <code>ModelViewSet</code>. This class not only combines the two views mentioned in the preceding discussion (that is, list and detail) but also allows you to create, update, and delete model instances. The code needed to implement all this functionality could be as simple as specifying the serializer and <code>queryset</code>. For example, a view that allows you to manage all these actions for your user model could be defined as tersely as the following:</p>
			<pre>class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    queryset = User</pre>
			<p>Lastly, DRF provides a <code>ReadOnlyModelViewSet</code> class. This is a simpler version of the preceding <code>ModelViewSet</code>. It is identical, except that it only allows you to list and retrieve specific users. You cannot create, update, or delete records.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-352"><a id="_idTextAnchor368"/>Routers</h1>
			<p>Routers, when used along with a viewset, take care of automatically creating the required URL endpoints for the viewset. This is because a single viewset is accessed at different URLs. For example, in the preceding <code>UserViewSet</code>, you would access a list of users at the URL <code>/api/users/</code>, and a specific user record at the URL <code>/api/users/123</code>, where <code>123</code> is the primary key of that user record. Here is a simple example of how you might use a router in the context of the previously defined <code>UserViewSet</code>:</p>
			<pre>from rest_framework import routers
router = routers.SimpleRouter()
router.register(r'users', UserViewSet)
urlpatterns = router.urls</pre>
			<p>Now, let's try to combine the concepts of routers and viewsets in a simple exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-353"><a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>Exercise 12.04: Using ViewSets and Routers</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will combine the existing views to create a viewset and create the required routing for the viewset:</p>

You can find the complete code snippet at <a href="http://packt.live/3osYJli">http://packt.live/3osYJli</a>.</pre><p>Here, we added two new fields to <code>BookSerializer</code>, namely <code>reviews</code> and <code>rating</code>. The interesting thing about these fields is that the logic behind them is defined as a method on the serializer itself. This is why we use the <code>serializers.SerializerMethodField</code> type to set the <code>serializer</code> class attributes.</p></li>
				<li>Open the file <code>bookr/reviews/api_views.py</code>, remove the pre-existing code, and add the following:<pre>from rest_framework import viewsets
from rest_framework.pagination import LimitOffsetPagination
from .models import Book, Review
from .serializers import BookSerializer, ReviewSerializer
class BookViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
class ReviewViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Review.objects.order_by('-date_created')
    serializer_class = ReviewSerializer
    pagination_class = LimitOffsetPagination
    authentication_classes = []</pre><p>Here, we have removed the <code>AllBook</code> and the <code>BookDetail</code> views and replaced them with <code>BookViewSet</code> and <code>ReviewViewSet</code>. In the first line, we import the <code>ViewSets</code> module from <code>rest_framework</code>. The <code>BookViewSet</code> class is a subclass of <code>ReadOnlyModelViewSet</code>, which ensures that the views are used for the <code>GET</code> operation only.</p><p>Next, open the <code>bookr/reviews/urls.py</code> file, remove the first two URL patterns starting with <code>api/</code>, and then add the following (highlighted) code:</p><pre><code>all_books</code> and <code>book_detail</code> paths into a single path called <code>books</code>.  We have also added a new endpoint under the path <code>reviews</code> which we will need in a later chapter.</p><p>We start by importing the <code>DefaultRouter</code> class from <code>rest_framework.routers</code>. Then, we create a <code>router</code> object using the <code>DefaultRouter</code> class and then register the newly created <code>BookViewSet</code> and <code>ReviewViewSet</code>, as can be seen from the highlighted code. This ensures that the <code>BookViewSet</code> is invoked whenever the API has the <code>/api/books</code> path.</p></li>
				<li>Save all the files, and once the Django service restarts (or you start it manually with the <code>python manage.py runserver</code> command), go to the URL <code>http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/books/</code> to get a list of all the books. You should see the following view in the API explorer:<div><img src="img/B15509_12_05.jpg" alt="Figure 12.5: Book list at the path /api/books&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.5: Book list at the path /api/books</p></li>
				<li>You can also access the details for a specific book using the URL <code>http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/books/1/</code>. In this case, it will return details for the book with a primary key of <code>1</code> (if it exists in your database):<p> </p><div><img src="img/B15509_12_06.jpg" alt="Figure 12.6: Book details for &quot;Advanced Deep Learning with Keras&quot;&#13;&#10;"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.6: Book details for "Advanced Deep Learning with Keras"</p>
			<p>In this exercise, we saw how we can use viewsets and routers to combine the list and detail views into a single viewset. Using viewsets will make our code more consistent and idiomatic, making it easier to collaborate with other developers. This becomes particularly important when integrating with a separate frontend application.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-354"><a id="_idTextAnchor370"/>Authentication</h1>
			<p>As we learned in <em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Sessions and Authentication</em>, it is important to authenticate the users of our application. It is good practice to only allow those users who have registered in the application to log in and access information from the application. Similarly, for REST APIs too, we need to design a way to authenticate and authorize users before any information is passed on. For example, suppose Facebook's website makes an API request to get a list of all comments for a post. If they did not have authentication on this endpoint, you could use it to programmatically get comments for any post you want. They obviously don't want to allow this, so some sort of authentication needs to be implemented.</p>
			<p>There are different authentication schemes, such as <strong class="bold">Basic Authentication</strong>, <strong class="bold">Session Authentication</strong>, <strong class="bold">Token Authentication</strong>, <strong class="bold">Remote User Authentication</strong>, and various third-party authentication solutions. For the scope of this chapter, and for our Bookr application, we will use <strong class="bold">Token Authentication</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">For further reading on all the authentication schemes, please refer to the official documentation at <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication">https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-355"><a id="_idTextAnchor371"/>Token-Based Authentication</h2>
			<p>Token-based authentication works by generating a unique token for a user in exchange for the user's username and password. Once the token is generated, it will be stored in the database for further reference and will be returned to the user upon every login. </p>
			<p>This token is unique for a user and the user can then use this token to authorize every API request they make. Token-based authentication eliminates the need to pass the username and password on every request. It is much safer and is best suited to client-server communication, such as a JavaScript-based web client interacting with the backend application via REST APIs.</p>
			<p>An example of this would be a ReactJS or AngularJS application interacting with a Django backend via REST APIs. </p>
			<p>The same architecture can be used if you are developing a mobile application to interact with the backend server via REST APIs, for instance, an Android or iOS application interacting with a Django backend via REST APIs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-356"><a id="_idTextAnchor372"/>Exercise 12.05: Implementing Token-Based Authentication for Bookr APIs</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will implement token-based authentication for the <code>bookr</code> application's APIs:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>bookr/settings.py</code> file and add <code>rest_framework.authtoken</code> to <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>:<pre>INSTALLED_APPS = ['django.contrib.admin',\
                  'django.contrib.auth',\
                  ‹django.contrib.contenttypes›,\
                  'django.contrib.sessions',\
                  'django.contrib.messages',\
                  'django.contrib.staticfiles',\
                  ‹rest_framework›,\
                  <strong class="bold">‹rest_framework.authtoken›</strong>,\
                  ‹reviews›]</pre></li>
				<li>Since the <code>authtoken</code> app has associated database changes, run the <code>migrate</code> command in the command line/terminal as follows:<pre>python manage.py migrate</pre></li>
				<li>Open the <code>bookr/reviews/api_views.py</code> file, remove any pre-existing code, and replace it with the following:<pre>/reviews/api_views.py
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
from rest_framework import viewsets
from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication
from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token
from rest_framework.pagination import LimitOffsetPagination
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.status import HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND, HTTP_200_OK
from rest_framework.views import APIView
You can find the complete code for this file at <a href="http://packt.live/2JQebbS">http://packt.live/2JQebbS</a>.</pre><p>Here, we have defined a view called <code>Login</code>. The purpose of this view is to allow a user to get (or create if it does not already exist) a token that they can use to authenticate with the API. </p><p>We override the <code>post</code> method of this view because we want to customize the behavior when a user sends us data (that is, their login details). First, we use the <code>authenticate</code> method from Django's <code>auth</code> library to check whether the username and password are correct. If they are correct, then we will have a <code>user</code> object. If not, we return an <code>HTTP 404</code> error. If we do have a valid <code>user</code> object, then we simply get or create a token, and return it to the user.</p></li>
				<li>Next, let's add the authentication class to our <code>BookViewSet</code>. This means that when a user tries to access this viewset, it will require them to authenticate using token-based authentication. Note that it's possible to include a list of different accepted authentication methods, not just one. We also add the <code>permissions_classes</code> attribute, which just uses DRF's built-in class that checks to see if the given user has permission to view the data in this model:<pre>class <a id="_idTextAnchor373"/>BookViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
    <strong class="bold">authentication_classes = [TokenAuthentication]</strong>
<strong class="bold">    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]</strong></pre><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">The preceding code (highlighted) won't match the code you see on GitHub as we'll be modifying it later in <em class="italic">step 9</em></p></li>
				<li>Open <code>bookr/reviews/urls.py</code> file and add the following path into url patterns.<pre>path('api/login', api_views.Login.as_view(), name='login')</pre></li>
				<li>Save the file and wait for the application to restart, or start the server manually with the <code>python manage.py runserver</code> command. Then access the application using the URL <code>http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/login</code>. Your screen should appear as follows:<div><img src="img/B15509_12_07.jpg" alt="Figure 12.7: Login page&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.7: Login page</p><p>The API at <code>/api/login</code> is a <code>POST</code> only message, hence <code>Method GET not allowed</code> is displayed.</p></li>
				<li>Next, enter the following snippet in the content and click on <code>POST</code>:<pre>{
"username": "Peter",
"password": "testuserpassword"
}</pre><p>You will need to replace this with an actual username and password for your account in the database. Now you can see the token generated for the user. This is the token we need to use to access <code>BookSerializer</code>:</p><div><img src="img/B15509_12_08.jpg" alt="Figure 12.8: Token generated for the user&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 12.8: Token generated for the user</p></li>
				<li>Try to access the list of books using the API that we previously created at <code>http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/books/</code>. Note that you are now not allowed to access it. This is because this viewset now requires you to use your token to authenticate.<p>The same API can be accessed using <code>curl</code> on the command line: </p><pre>curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/books/
{"detail":"Authentication credentials were not provided."}</pre><p>Since the token was not provided, the message <code>Authentication credentials were not provided</code> is displayed:</p><div><img src="img/B15509_12_09.jpg" alt="Figure 12.9: Message saying that the authentication details weren't provided&#13;&#10;"/></div><pre>curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/books/ -H "Authorization: Token 724865fcaff6d0aace359620a12ec0b5cc6524fl"

				<li>Before moving on, set the authentication and permission classes on <code>BookViewSet</code> to an empty string. Future chapters will not utilize these authentication methods, and we will assume for sake of simplicity that our API can be accessed by an unauthenticated user.<pre>class BookViewSet(viewsets.ReadOnlyModelViewSet):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
    authentication_classes = []
    permission_classes = []</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we implemented token-based authentication in our Bookr app. We created a login view that allows us to retrieve the token for a given authenticated user. This then enabled us to make API requests from the command line by passing through the token as a header in the request.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-357"><a id="_idTextAnchor374"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter introduced REST APIs, a fundamental building block in most real-world web applications. These APIs facilitate communication between the backend server and the web browser, so they are central to your growth as a Django web developer. We learned how to serialize data in our database so that it can be transmitted via an HTTP request. We also learned the various options DRF gives us to simplify the code we write, taking advantage of the existing definitions of the models themselves. We also covered viewsets and routers, and saw how they can be used to condense code even further by combining the functionality of multiple views. We also learned about authentication and authorization and implemented token-based authentication for the book review app. In the next chapter, we will extend Bookr's functionality for its users by learning how to generate CSVs, PDFs, and other binary filetypes.</p>

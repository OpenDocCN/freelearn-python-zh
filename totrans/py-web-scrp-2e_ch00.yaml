- en: The internet contains the most useful set of data ever assembled, largely publicly
    accessible for free. However this data is not easily re-usable. It is embedded
    within the structure and style of websites and needs to be extracted to be useful.
    This process of extracting data from webpages is known as *web scraping* and is
    becoming increasingly useful as ever more information is available online.

- en: To help illustrate the crawling examples we have created a sample website at
    [http://example.webscraping.com](http://example.webscraping.com). The source code
    used to generate this website is available at [http://bitbucket.org/WebScrapingWithPython/website](http://bitbucket.org/WebScrapingWithPython/website),
    which includes instructions how to host the website yourself if you prefer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We decided to build a custom website for the examples instead of scraping live
    websites so we have full control over the environment. This provides us stability
    - live websites are updated more often than books and by the time you try a scraping
    example it may no longer work. Also a custom website allows us to craft examples
    that illustrate specific skills and avoid distractions. Finally a live website
    might not appreciate us using them to learn about web scraping and might then block
    our scrapers. Using our own custom website avoids these risks, however the skills
    learnt in these examples can certainly still be applied to live websites.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes prior programming experience and would most likely not be
    suitable for absolute beginners. The web scraping examples require competence
    with Python and installing modules with pip. If you need a brush-up there is an
    excellent free online book by Mark Pilgrim available at [http://www.diveintopython.net](http://www.diveintopython.net).
    This is the resource I originally used to learn Python.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The examples also assume knowledge of how webpages are constructed with HTML
    and updated with JavaScript. Prior knowledge of HTTP, CSS, AJAX, WebKit, and Redis
    would also be useful but not required, and will be introduced as each technology
    is needed. Detailed references for many of these topics are available at [https://developer.mozilla.org/](https://developer.mozilla.org/).

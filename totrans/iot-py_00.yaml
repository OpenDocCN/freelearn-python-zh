- en: Internet of Things, also known as IoT, is changing the way we live and represents
    one of the biggest challenges in the IT industry. Developers are creating low-cost
    devices that collect huge amounts of data, interact with each other, and take
    advantage of cloud services and cloud-based storage. Makers all over the world
    are working on fascinating projects that transform everyday objects into smart
    devices with sensors and actuators.

    indicating that the liquid inside has the right temperature so that you can drink
    it without worrying about checking whether it is too hot. In case you move the
    coffee cup before you receive the message, your wearable vibrates to indicate
    that you don't have to drink it yet.

    and you won''t have to worry about ordering more coffee: the coffee dispenser
    will automatically place an online order to request coffee when the coffee level
    is not enough to cover the rest of the day. You just need to approve the online
    order that the coffee dispenser suggests from your smartwatch. Based on certain
    statistical algorithms, the coffee dispenser will know the appropriate time to
    make the order.'

    orders in case the probable consumption of decaffeinated coffee increases too
    much. We have smart coffee cups, smart coffee dispensers, smartwatches, smartphones,
    and wearables. All of them take advantage of the cloud to create a smart ecosystem
    capable of providing us with all the different types of coffees we need for our
    day.

    board for IoT projects. We can boot a Linux version and easily execute Python
    scripts that can interact with the different components included on the board.
    This book will teach you to develop IoT prototypes, from selecting the hardware
    to all the necessary stacks with Python 2.7.3, its libraries, and tools. In case
    you need a smaller board or an alternative, all the examples included in the book
    are compatible with Intel Edison boards, and therefore, you can switch to this
    board in case you need to.

- en: Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It is open source,
    multiplatform, and you can use it to develop any kind of application, from websites
    to extremely complex scientific computing applications. There is always a Python
    package that makes things easier for us in order to avoid reinventing the wheel
    and solve problems faster. Python is an ideal choice for developing a complete
    IoT stack. This book covers all the things you need to know to transform everyday
    objects into IoT projects.

    with Python as the programming language. You will leverage your existing Python
    knowledge to capture data from the real world, interact with physical objects,
    develop APIs, and use different IoT protocols. You will use specific libraries
    to easily work with low-level hardware, sensors, actuators, buses, and displays.
    You will learn how to take advantage of all the Python packages with the Intel
    Galileo Gen 2 board. You will be ready to become a maker and to be a part of the
    exciting IoT world.

    Hardware"), *Understanding and Setting up the Base IoT Hardware*, start us off
    on our journey towards Internet of Things (IoT) with Python and the Intel Galileo
    Gen 2 board. We will learn the different features offered by this board and visualize
    its different components. We will understand the meaning of the different pins,
    LEDs, and connectors. We will learn to check the board''s firmware version and
    to update if necessary.'

    2"), *Working with Python on Intel Galileo Gen 2*, leads us through many procedures
    that make it possible to work with Python as the main programming language to
    create IoT projects with our Intel Galileo Gen 2 board. We will write a Linux
    Yocto image to a microSD card, configure the board to make it boot this image,
    update many libraries to use their latest versions, and launch the Python interpreter.'

    *Interacting with Digital Outputs with Python*, teaches us how to work with two
    different libraries to control digital outputs in Python: mraa and wiring-x86\.
    We will connect LEDs and resistors to a breadboard and write code to turn on between
    0 to 9 LEDs. Then, we will improve our Python code to take advantage of Python''s
    object-oriented features, and we will prepare the code to make it easy to build
    an API that will allow us to print numbers with LEDs with a REST API.'

    Modulation"), *Working with a RESTful API and Pulse Width Modulation*, has us
    working with Tornado Web Server, Python, the HTTPie command-line HTTP client,
    and the mraa and wiring-x86 libraries. We will generate many versions of RESTful
    APIs that will allow us to interact with the board in computers and devices connected
    to the LAN. We will be able to compose and send HTTP requests that print numbers
    in LEDs, change the brightness levels for three LEDs, and generate millions of
    colors with an RGB LED.'

    Interrupts"), *Working with Digital Inputs, Polling and Interrupts*, explains
    the difference between reading pushbutton statuses with polling and working with
    interrupts and interrupt handlers. We will write code that will allow the user
    to perform the same actions with either pushbuttons in the breadboard or HTTP
    requests. We will combine code that reacts to changes in the statuses of the pushbuttons
    with a RESTful API built with Tornado Web Server. We will create classes to encapsulate
    pushbuttons and the necessary configurations with the mraa and wiring-x86 libraries.'

    *Working with Analog Inputs and Local Storage*, explains how to work with analog
    inputs to measure voltage values. We will measure voltages with an analog pin
    and both the mraa and the wiring-x86 libraries. We will be able to transform a
    variable resistor into a voltage source and make it possible to measure the darkness
    level with an analog input, a photoresistor, and a voltage divider. We will fire
    actions when the environment light changes, and we will work with both analog
    inputs and outputs. We will register events by taking advantage of the logging
    features included in the Python standard library and the USB 2.0 connector included
    in the Intel Galileo Gen 2 board.'

    with a variety of sensors to retrieve data from the real world. We will take advantage
    of the modules and classes included in the upm library that will make it easy
    for us to start working with analog and digital sensors. We will learn the importance
    of considering units of measurement because sensors always provide values measured
    in a specific unit, which we must consider. We will measure the magnitude and
    direction of proper acceleration or g-force, ambient temperature, and humidity.'

    the we can connect to our board through the I²C bus. We will work with an LCD
    display with an RGB backlight, and we will then replace it with an OLED dot matrix.
    We will write code that takes advantage of the modules and classes included in
    the upm library to work with LCD and OLED displays and show text on them. We will
    also write code that interacts with an analog servo. We will control the shaft
    to allow us to create a gauge chart to display the temperature value retrieved
    with a sensor. Our Python code will make things move.'

    to easily publish data collected from sensors and visualize it in a web-based
    dashboard. We will work with the MQTT protocol and its publish/subscribe model
    to process commands in our board and indicate when the commands are successfully
    processed through messages. First, we will work with the PubNub cloud that works
    with the MQTT protocol under the hood. Then, we will develop the same example

    establish bidirectional communications with our IoT devices.'

    IoT Analytics, a cloud-based service that allows us to organize huge amounts of
    data collected by multiple IoT devices and their sensors. We will use the requests
    package to write a few lines of Python code to interact with the Intel IoT Analytics
    REST API. We will learn about the different options that Intel IoT Analytics offers
    us to analyze huge amounts of data, and we will define rules to trigger alerts.'

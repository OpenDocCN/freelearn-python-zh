<p>The internet contains the most useful set of data ever assembled, largely publicly accessible for free. However this data is not easily re-usable. It is embedded within the structure and style of websites and needs to be extracted to be useful. This process of extracting data from webpages is known as <em>web scraping</em> and is becoming increasingly useful as ever more information is available online.</p>
<p>All code used has been tested with Python 3.4+ and is available for download at <a href="https://github.com/kjam/wswp">https://github.com/kjam/wswp</a>.</p>

<p>To help illustrate the crawling examples we have created a sample website at <a href="http://example.webscraping.com">http://example.webscraping.com</a>. The source code used to generate this website is available at <a href="http://bitbucket.org/WebScrapingWithPython/website">http://bitbucket.org/WebScrapingWithPython/website</a>, which includes instructions how to host the website yourself if you prefer.</p>
<p>We decided to build a custom website for the examples instead of scraping live websites so we have full control over the environment. This provides us stability - live websites are updated more often than books and by the time you try a scraping example it may no longer work. Also a custom website allows us to craft examples that illustrate specific skills and avoid distractions. Finally a live website might not appreciate us using them to learn about web scraping and might then&#160;block our scrapers. Using our own custom website avoids these risks, however the skills learnt in these examples can certainly still be applied to live websites.</p>

<p>This book assumes prior programming experience and would most likely not be suitable for absolute beginners. The web scraping examples require competence with Python and installing modules with pip. If you need a brush-up there is an excellent free online book by Mark Pilgrim available at <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net">http://www.diveintopython.net</a>. This is the resource I originally used to learn Python.</p>
<p>The examples also assume knowledge of how webpages are constructed with HTML and updated with JavaScript. Prior knowledge of HTTP, CSS, AJAX, WebKit, and Redis would also be useful but not required, and will be introduced as each technology is needed. Detailed references for many of these topics are available at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">https://developer.mozilla.org/</a>.</p>

<p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <kbd>include</kbd> directive."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>from urllib.request import urlopen<br/>from urllib.error import URLError<br/><br/>url = 'http://example.webscraping.com'<br/>try:<br/>    html = urlopen(url).read()<br/>except urllib2.URLError as e:<br/>    html = None
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>python script.py</strong>
</pre>
<p>We will occasionally show Python interpreter prompts used by the normal Python interpreter, such as:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib</strong>
</pre>
<p>Or the IPython interpreter, such as:</p>
<pre><strong>In [1]: import urllib</strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "clicking the <span class="packt_screen">Next</span> button moves you to the next screen".</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>

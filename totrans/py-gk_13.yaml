- en: We will not finish our journey until we apply what we have learned so far to
    build modern solutions, especially for the cloud. This is a core part of our journey,
    where we challenge our learning progress by solving real-world problems. First,
    we look into how to build web applications and REST APIs using Python frameworks
    such as Flask. Next, we deep dive into implementing serverless applications for
    the cloud using the microservices architecture and serverless functions. We cover
    both local and cloud deployment options for our code exercises and case studies.
    Later, we explore how to use Python to build machine learning models and deploy
    them in the cloud. We conclude our journey by investigating the role of Python
    for network automation with real-world network management-related use cases.

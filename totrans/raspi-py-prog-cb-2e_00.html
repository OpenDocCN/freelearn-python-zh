Modern home computers, tablets, and phones are typically focused on providing content to the user to consume, either as a passive viewer or through basic interaction via games and activities.</p><p>However, the Raspberry Pi turns this concept on its head. The idea is that the user provides the input and the imagination, and the Raspberry Pi becomes an extension of their creativity. The Raspberry Pi provides a simple, low-cost platform that you can use to experiment with and play with your own ideas. It won't feed you information; it will let you discover it firsthand.</p><p>This book takes everything I have found exciting and interesting with the Raspberry Pi and puts it in an easy-to-follow format.</p><p>I hope that people will read this book and start their own Raspberry Pi journey; it has so much to offer, and the book is aimed squarely at showing off what you can achieve with it.</p><p>Like any good cookbook, the pages should be worn and used, and it should be something that is always being pulled off the shelf to refer to. I hope it will become your own, personal, go-to reference.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with a Raspberry Pi Computer">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with a Raspberry Pi Computer</em>, introduces the Raspberry Pi and explores the various ways that it can be set up and used, including how it can be used on a network and connected to remotely with another computer.</p><p>

<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Using Python to Drive Hardware">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Using Python to Drive Hardware</em>, establishes the fact that to experience the Raspberry Pi at its best, we really have to use it with our own electronics. It discusses how to create circuits with LEDs and switches, and use them to indicate the system status and provide control. Finally, it shows us how to create our own game controller, light display and a persistence of vision text display. </p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Sense and Display Real-World Data">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Sense and Display Real-World Data</em>, explains the use of an analog-to-digital convertor to provide sensor readings to the Raspberry Pi. We discover how to store and graph the data in real time, as well as display it on an LCD text display. Next we record the data in a SQL database and display it in our own webserver. Finally, we transfer the data to the Internet, which will allow us to view and share the captured data anywhere in the world. </p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Creating Projects with the Raspberry Pi Camera Module">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Creating Projects with the Raspberry Pi Camera Module</em>, teaches us how to use the Raspberry Pi camera module, creating our own applications to produce time-lapse videos, stop-frame animations, and a bedtime book reader controlled with QR codes. Additionally we make use of the immensely powerful image processing library OpenCV to perform color recognition and object (or in this case, a tortoise) tracking. </p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Building Robots">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Building Robots</em>, takes you through building two different types of robots (a Rover- Pi and a Pi-Bug), plus driving a servo-based robot arm. We look at motor and servo control methods, using sensors, and adding a compass sensor for navigation.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Interfacing with Technology">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Interfacing with Technology</em>, teaches us how to use the Raspberry Pi to trigger remote mains sockets, with which we can control household appliances. We learn how to communicate with the Raspberry Pi over a serial interface and use a smartphone to control everything using Bluetooth. Finally, we look at creating our own applications to control USB devices. </p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Hardware and Software List">Appendix</a>, <em>Hardware and Software List</em>, provides us with the full list of the hardware components and modules used in the book, along with suitable places to purchase them from.

This will allow you to get results quickly, and most importantly, understand how you achieved them. </p><p>All the examples are written using Python 3, with clear and detailed explanations of how everything works so that you can adapt and use all the information in your own projects. </p><p>As you progress through the book, it will explain how to structure and develop your code efficiently, building on the various techniques that can be applied as you progress. By the end, you will have a toolset of skills that you can apply to whatever your imagination inspires you to do.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Safety and using electronics</h1></div></div></div><p>This book encourages you to experiment and connect your own circuits to the general-purpose input/output Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. This is an excellent way to learn about electronics and software at the same time. However, it is important to remember that the GPIO pins are unprotected, and if wired incorrectly, can easily be damaged or even cause the Raspberry Pi to stop working altogether. Therefore, care should be taken to correctly follow the instructions and wiring diagrams and check everything carefully before switching the Raspberry Pi on. </p><p>All the circuits, modules, and components described in this book are intended as demonstration examples only. They have not been tested for extended use and should not be left unattended or should not be used in safety-critical applications without adequate safeguards in place. Remember that all electronics must undergo rigorous safety testing to ensure that in the event of failure, there will be no risk of harm to people or property. </p><p>You should never attempt to modify or alter devices that are connected to mains electricity without proper training, and you must never directly connect any homemade devices to the mains supply.</p></div>

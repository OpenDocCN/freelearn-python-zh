<h1 id="_idParaDest-385"><a id="_idTextAnchor402"/>Your Next Steps with PyCharm</h1>
<p>PyCharm’s features are so extensive, and improvements from JetBrains come so rapidly that it’s been hard to keep up.</p>
<p>In this, my parting chapter, I want to do a few more things to try to do justice to this amazing piece of software. In this chapter, we’ll cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll do the obligatory wrap-up by briefly summarizing and commenting on our journey together so far.</li>
<li>I’ll cover a few cool features to help with your productivity that just didn’t fit neatly into the chapter topics presented so far.</li>
<li>I’ll cover some cool new features that were introduced over the course of the 8 months it took me to write the book. I’ve been covering version 2023.1, and I have avoided updating it so I can stay consistent with screenshots of the UI used throughout the book. The 2023.2 release is out and there<a id="_idIndexMarker1411"/> are some amazing changes, including a beta of the new <strong class="bold">AI Assistant</strong>!</li>
<li>I’ll raise a glass and shed a tear as we part company until the next book comes out.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll do my best not to get emotional on you. We’ve been together for a while now and it’s going to be hard to take this victory lap with you knowing the book is almost finished. I’m getting a little misty over here just thinking about it, so let’s keep moving.</p>
<p>In order to proceed through this chapter, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An installed and working Python interpreter. I’ll be using the latest from <a href="https://python.org">https://python.org</a>.</li>
<li>Installed copies of <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenv</code>. You get these automatically when you install Python on Windows, and macOS includes them on every system. If you are using Linux, you need to install the package managers (such as <code>pip</code>) and the virtual environment tools (e.g., <code>virtualenv</code>) separately. Our examples will use <code>pip</code> and <code>virtualenv</code>.</li>
<li>An installed and working copy of PyCharm. Installation was covered in <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>. The screenshots in this chapter come from version 2023.2.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>This book’s sample source code from GitHub can be found at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Application-Development-with-PyCharm---Second-Edition/tree/main/chapter-16">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Application-Development-with-PyCharm---Second-Edition/tree/main/chapter-16</a>. We covered cloning the code in <a href="B19644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Installation </em><em class="italic">and Configuration</em>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-386"><a id="_idTextAnchor403"/>Miscellaneous topics in PyCharm</h1>
<p>As I said, the sheer volume of features in this IDE is staggering. In this section, I’ll cover a few things that didn’t fit neatly into other chapters. I’ll be presenting them more in the spirit of my saying “Hey, look at this!”, rather than presenting a full tutorial on each feature.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-387"><a id="_idTextAnchor404"/>Remote virtual environments</h2>
<p>We’ve had this feature<a id="_idIndexMarker1412"/> for a while now, and I think it is likely outshined by the newer remote development features we covered in <a href="B19644_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor379"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>. This feature allows you to work with an interpreter on another computer accessible via SSH. There are a couple of use cases for this. I have used this feature to debug a copy of an application using the virtual environment on the production server. I have a copy of the production code on my computer, but the venv is on the production system. This allows me to reproduce a bug and fix it locally using the exact environment where it normally lives. This was especially effective back when I used Mac and Windows laptops as my main development environment while the production environment ran in Linux. As we’ve pointed<a id="_idIndexMarker1413"/> out, lots of packages<a id="_idIndexMarker1414"/> deploy differently<a id="_idIndexMarker1415"/> based on the operating system. I’ve always had challenges with <strong class="bold">NumPy</strong>, <strong class="bold">pandas</strong>, and <strong class="bold">pymssql</strong> (the Microsoft supported driver for SQL Server), which work very differently in these different environments, especially Windows. To build your third-party packages that leverage C code, you need a compiler. In Linux it’s <em class="italic">cmake</em>. On Windows, it is the Microsoft C++ compiler. There is a big difference between the two, and testing an application only on Windows doesn’t cut it for me. I want a more realistic test, and using this feature I can use the exact environment where it will run.</p>
<p>You can create or use a virtual environment<a id="_idIndexMarker1416"/> on a remote computer by setting up an SSH connection to it. We covered creating an SSH connection back in <a href="B19644_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor379"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, so I won’t repeat the instructions here. The options for using a remote environment are alongside the normal options in the project interpreter settings shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.1</em>.</p>

<p>Naturally there is going to be a pretty big performance hit when you work this way; at least there was for me. For my use case, it was well worth it!</p>
<p>You’ll note there is also an option for <strong class="bold">On Vagrant</strong>, which is effectively the same option, but instead of a random remote server<a id="_idIndexMarker1417"/> it’s on a local virtual machine managed by <strong class="bold">HashiCorp’s Vagrant</strong>. What is Vagrant you ask?</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-388"><a id="_idTextAnchor405"/>Working with HashiCorp Vagrant</h2>
<p>Within the field<a id="_idIndexMarker1418"/> of DevOps, a movement called <strong class="bold">Infrastructure as Code </strong>(<strong class="bold">IaC</strong>) has become very important. The idea<a id="_idIndexMarker1419"/> is that nobody really runs anything on bare metal anymore; everything is run on a virtual machine. Regardless, one of the challenges I’ve faced over the years is when I go to set up my testing and production environments, I have to do it all by hand and it takes quite a while. My objective is to set up at least two or three nearly identical environments.</p>
<p>Let’s say I’m creating a product using Flask that uses React for the frontend, and Microsoft SQL Server as the database. In order to run this using best practices, I need a few servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need a web server such as Nginx or Apache to serve my React app along with any static assets that might be needed.</li>
<li>I need an application server. Flask’s development<a id="_idIndexMarker1420"/> server isn’t going to cut it in production. I need a server that runs something like <strong class="bold">Green Unicorn</strong> (<em class="italic">gunicorn</em> for short), which is a production-grade<a id="_idIndexMarker1421"/> WSGI server capable of handling production loads. <strong class="bold">WSGI</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Web Server Gateway Interface</strong> in the realm of Python development. It is a specification for a standardized interface between web servers and Python web applications or frameworks such as Flask, FastAPI, and Django. WSGI defines a set of rules and conventions that allow web servers to communicate with Python applications in a consistent and interoperable way.</li>
<li>I need a dedicated database server for SQL Server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping it simple, that’s three servers, each replicated<a id="_idIndexMarker1422"/> three times: one for development testing, one for staging or <strong class="bold">user acceptance testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">UAT</strong>), and one for production. For each server, I need to install, patch, and harden the operating system. Then I need to set up each type of server. The web server is easy, I just need to install nginx and configure it so it uses SSL, redirects any requests not using HTTPS, caches the static content, and reverse-proxies API requests to the API server running Flask.</p>
<p>The Flask server is more involved since best practice calls for having nginx on that system as well, forwarding traffic to Green Unicorn. I’ll usually set up firewall rules on this server to reject any traffic not coming from the web server, and block any ports that are not needed.</p>
<p>The database server is the toughest<a id="_idIndexMarker1423"/> one. Ideally, I need separate partitions for OS, logging, and data to prevent IO performance bottlenecks. All totaled, it can easily take a week for me to set up and validate a small environment.</p>
<p>If I were to use IaC, I could write a script that automates setting up and tearing down each of the three environments. It would take just as long to write the script as it does to manually set everything up, but when it comes time to scale or update my infrastructure, having it in code will be very helpful. Since it is in the code, everything is documented. If I want to update the OS, say from Ubuntu 20 to 22, I just change a variable and I can rebuild all new servers or update the ones I have. IaC is worth the time investment in every single case beyond a throw-away prototype.</p>
<p>One of the more<a id="_idIndexMarker1424"/> popular IaC frameworks is <strong class="bold">HashiCorp’s Terraform</strong>. You’ll find plugins for the <strong class="bold">HashiCorp language </strong>(<strong class="bold">HCL</strong>) in JetBrains Marketplace that allow you to work with Terraform<a id="_idIndexMarker1425"/> files with the usual syntax coloring and auto-complete functionality. Terraform is designed to help you configure virtual machines by way of providers. There’s a provider for VMware and that’s what converts your IaC into actual virtual machines. There are providers for cloud services too, including Azure, AWS, and Digital Ocean.</p>
<p>HashiCorp also makes a product called <strong class="bold">Vagrant</strong>. Vagrant is designed to be IaC<a id="_idIndexMarker1426"/> for your local computer. I’ve been saying all along that you should use Linux for development if you plan to run your final application on a Linux server. But most people would rather not give up working on Windows or Mac. Since Mac is based on a Linux-like operating system, the Mac is at least close, but it won’t be identical if you’re running your work in Ubuntu, Red Hat, or Fedora.</p>
<p>Vagrant is a program that, when coupled with a local hypervisor such as VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, or Microsoft’s Hyper-V, allows you to create a script that generates<a id="_idIndexMarker1427"/> a local virtual machine, called a<em class="italic"> box</em>, that can match your production environment. Essentially you are automating the creation and maintenance of virtual machines on your local computer the same way you’d use Terraform for your servers. Vagrant does some neat things, such as automatically mapping your project’s folder to the virtual machine, so you don’t need to constantly copy your code to the VM manually. Your terminal in PyCharm is automatically connected to the VM using SSH, so when you execute commands you are using your local terminal<a id="_idIndexMarker1428"/> in the IDE, but the VM is handling the execution. You could do this with <strong class="bold">Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (<strong class="bold">WSL</strong>), but there would be more effort involved and WSL is pretty limited in how it can be used compared to making individual VMs for each project.</p>
<p>While Vagrant is very useful, most developers<a id="_idIndexMarker1429"/> are shifting to Docker for these kinds of workflows, but I still see developers, especially in the cybersecurity fields and in educational settings, still working with virtual machines. Vagrant has an advantage in that Docker containers are immutable, meaning they can’t be changed once they are created. While this is operationally superior, since immutability of a deployed application provides a very stable system, it might be less desirable for daily development since it is useful for a developer to be able to fiddle with the environment without restrictions.</p>
<p>Vagrant creates a box, which is just a virtual machine, and represents a full server experience with a complete operating system. You can do anything you want to it, and since it’s on your laptop, if your machinations break the system you can just kill the box and make another reset to its original state in minutes.</p>
<p>Vagrant gives you the ability to build web applications using a real IP address instead of using<a id="_idIndexMarker1430"/> the loopback address, also known as localhost. This provides <a id="_idIndexMarker1431"/>local testing advantages since applications working on localhost often behave differently than applications bound to a real IP address. Furthermore, you can choose to make your Vagrant box’s IP address shareable not only on the local network but also on the public internet. When you’re ready to show off your progress, you can invite others to your shared Vagrant box, elicit feedback, and then turn sharing off.</p>
<p>You’ll find the tooling for Vagrant in the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> menu shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.2</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.2: PyCharm supports all the Vagrant commands directly via menu options" src="img/B19644_16_002.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.2: PyCharm supports all the Vagrant commands directly via menu options</p>
<p>In order to use Vagrant, you need<a id="_idIndexMarker1432"/> to install it along with a supported<a id="_idIndexMarker1433"/> hypervisor. You can find the installation instructions at <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install">https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install</a>. As for the hypervisor, the default<a id="_idIndexMarker1434"/> is Oracle VirtualBox. You can find more about VirtualBox at <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have these programs installed you can use the <strong class="bold">Init in Project Root</strong> option shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.2</em>.</p>
<p>This will prompt you to create a file called <code>Vagrantfile</code> at the root of your project by selecting a name for your Vagrant box and providing the image URL. The dialog is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.3</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.3: You are prompted to create a Vagrant box with a very old default" src="img/B19644_16_003.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.3: You are prompted to create a Vagrant box with a very old default</p>
<p>It is clear that this is a very old default since <code>lucid32</code> refers to Ubuntu 10. At the time of writing, the current version of Ubuntu is 23 while the long-term support edition is 22.</p>
<p>You should probably find a newer box definition if you’re serious<a id="_idIndexMarker1435"/> about using a more current virtual machine. You can find box definitions at <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com">https://app.vagrantup.com</a>. I’ve done this in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.4</em> where I’ve searched<a id="_idIndexMarker1436"/> for <code>Jammy Jellyfish</code>, the project codename for <strong class="bold">Ubuntu 22</strong>, which is what I use for all my current production projects.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.4: You can find a wide variety of predefined boxes on the Vagrant Cloud registry" src="img/B19644_16_004.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.4: You can find a wide variety of predefined boxes on the Vagrant Cloud registry</p>
<p>Once you find one you want<a id="_idIndexMarker1437"/> to use, click on it. In <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, I’m clicking on the second entry in the list.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.5: This is the box definition for Ubuntu Jammy 64" src="img/B19644_16_005.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.5: This is the box definition for Ubuntu Jammy 64</p>
<p>Now that we have a box definition, refer back to <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.3</em>. In the first field, you need to type the box name indicated by the dark arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, which is <code>ubuntu/jammy64</code>. Next, copy the name of the box definition’s URL, indicated by the light arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, which in our case is <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/jammy64">https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/jammy64</a>. Clicking <strong class="bold">OK</strong> will download the box image and create the VM. Once it is ready, you’ll find the rest of the Vagrant tools are no longer grayed out in the menu as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.6</em>. The generated Vagrantfile is open (not automatically, I did that), and you can even see that PyCharm is prompting me to add the new file to the Git repository.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.6: The Vagrant tool options are now available" src="img/B19644_16_006.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.6: The Vagrant tool options are now available</p>
<p>If you dive more deeply<a id="_idIndexMarker1438"/> into using Vagrant, you’ll find that like many of PyCharm’s integrations, the IDE gives you a graphical way to perform what would otherwise be a command-line workflow. You can run the commands using the menu in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.6</em>, or you can type the commands in your terminal to achieve the same result. Packt has some good books on developing with Vagrant. I’ll be sure to leave a few suggestions in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section of this chapter.</p>
<p>There are some big benefits to using Vagrant. You can have your whole development team use identical environments for developing and testing your application using the same environment you’ll use in production. No more “<em class="italic">It works on my machine</em>”, which implies the code is fine and a configuration issue is to blame. Since the environment configuration is standardized, and maintained as part of the code base, the project should work the same everywhere assuming the code and any external configuration files (such as <code>.ini</code> or <code>.env</code> files) or environment variables are also identical.</p>
<p>Using IaC in Vagrant shields less experienced developers who don’t know how to set up virtual machines, and it also standardizes<a id="_idIndexMarker1439"/> the build so everybody’s VM is the same. The configuration is tracked in your revision control system and so it tracks and updates just like application code.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-389"><a id="_idTextAnchor406"/>Tracking your time</h2>
<p>Over the course<a id="_idIndexMarker1440"/> of my long career, I’ve worked for the United States Government on several occasions, and I’ve run my own freelancing practice. In each case, I’ve needed a way to track my time. In the case of government contracts, I have to track a set of billing codes down to 7-minute intervals. Time tracking can be used in more reasonable environments as well. I try to keep time-tracking data to correlate the ever-elusive story point used in agile development methodologies such as Scrum with how much time it will take to complete a task. According to most agile methodologies, people are really bad at estimating time. But they are pretty good at estimating relative size. In <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.3</em>, you would have a hard time telling exactly how tall, in inches or centimeters, the soy milk carton is next to the cup of latte.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.7: How tall is the soy milk carton?" src="img/B19644_16_007.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.7: How tall is the soy milk carton?</p>
<p>Is it 8 inches tall or 20? But if you try estimating<a id="_idIndexMarker1441"/> the size using the coffee cup as your unit of measure, you can be more precise. The carton is about two and a half coffee cups tall. So it is with story points, but at the end of the day, the boss really wants to know how long something will take. You can’t tell her you’ll have her feature done in two coffee cups and expect her to be happy about it. This could invite the obvious reply, “Great, so it will be done after my second cup of coffee!”</p>
<p>I do my normal story point estimate, then I track my time to see how long it really took so I can both give the boss her answer and be better at estimating next time.</p>
<p>To use the time tracking features in PyCharm, you need to connect to a server. By server, in this case, I mean one of the project tracking services supported by PyCharm, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.4</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.8: Click the Configure Servers menu item to configure your project tracker" src="img/B19644_16_008.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.8: Click the Configure Servers menu item to configure your project tracker</p>
<p>When you click this menu item, you should see the screen shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.5</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.9: Pick whichever project tracking service you use from the list" src="img/B19644_16_009.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.9: Pick whichever project tracking service you use from the list</p>
<p>Once your server is registered, you’ll be able<a id="_idIndexMarker1442"/> to pick a backlog item or issue that is assigned to you. <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.6</em> shows my YouTrack server integration with the issue number <strong class="bold">DEMO-20: Finish </strong><a href="B19644_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor401"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a><strong class="bold"> in </strong><strong class="bold">PyCharm Book</strong>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.10: The time I’ve spent on this issue is automatically tracked</p>
<p>As you switch between tasks throughout the day, you can switch from right in your IDE, which will track how much time you spend on each task. You can then synchronize your work times up to the server to keep<a id="_idIndexMarker1443"/> an accurate tally of how you are spending your time.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-390"><a id="_idTextAnchor407"/>TODO list</h2>
<p>This may sound like it is related<a id="_idIndexMarker1444"/> to the time tracking feature, but it really isn’t. The TODO list panel shows you all those TODO comments in your code as a list. You can see an example in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.7</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.11: The TODO panel in PyCharm lists all the to-do comments in your code and takes you right to the given line when you double-click" src="img/B19644_16_011.jpg"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.11: The TODO panel in PyCharm lists all the to-do comments in your code and takes you right to the given line when you double-click</p>
<p>You can double-click the TODO item to go right to that line in the code, allowing you to quickly find your way back to whatever you had to temporarily abandon.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-391"><a id="_idTextAnchor408"/>Macros</h2>
<p>A macro is a script of recorded keystrokes <a id="_idIndexMarker1445"/>that can be played back in order to create useful automation. In my opinion, learning to use these is a necessary survival skill in the jungles of software development.</p>
<p>Let’s say we need a list of things that don’t change to populate a drop-down list box in HTML. For this example, I’m going to create a <code>SELECT</code> tag with all 50 states of the US. This is something that hasn’t changed since 1959, although if I’m ever elected Emperor, Canada and Mexico are first on my list. They’ll never see it coming.</p>
<p>Back in reality, I need to get this done and I darn sure don’t want to type all this out. I asked my best friend ChatGPT to give me a list of the 50 states in alphabetical order. The result is in the <code>us-states.txt</code> file in the chapter source.</p>
<p>You’ll also find an HTML file called <code>states.html</code> in the source. I’ve included the code as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pick a state:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;select id="state" name="state"&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre> <p>As you can see, there is nothing in the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> tag, which is meant to render a drop-down selection list in the HTML page defined by the rest of the code in that file. I need to add the states so they look like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;option&gt;Alabama&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option&gt;Arkansas&lt;/option&gt;</pre> <p>And so on for all 50. I can do this with a macro. Sure, I could also just have ChatGPT generate it for me, but that would be anti-climactic since this is a book on PyCharm and not a book on ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Open the project called <code>feature_demo</code> in the chapter source code, then open the <code>united-states.txt file</code>. Start by placing<a id="_idIndexMarker1446"/> your cursor in front of <code>Alabama</code> in the <code>united-states.txt</code> file, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.9</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.12: Put your cursor in front of Alabama" src="img/B19644_16_012.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.12: Put your cursor in front of Alabama</p>
<p>Next, click <strong class="bold">Edit | Macro | Start Macro Recording</strong> as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.10</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.13: Start recording your macro" src="img/B19644_16_013.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.13: Start recording your macro</p>
<p>With the macro recording, type <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>. Then hit the <em class="italic">End</em> (<em class="italic">Cmd + Right Arrow</em> on a Mac) key on your keyboard to go to the end of the line, then type <code>&lt;/option&gt;</code>. Press the <em class="italic">down arrow</em> key on your keyboard, followed by the <em class="italic">Home</em> key (<em class="italic">Cmd + Left Arrow</em> on Mac). The cursor should now be at the beginning of the second line, <code>Arkansas</code>. Go back to the same menu item shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.10</em>, but note <code>option-list</code>.</p>
<p>Return to the menu shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.10</em> again and you’ll see either your saved macro name listed or just <code>Arkansas</code> to an <code>option</code> tag.</p>
<p>You can map your macro to a key combination and repeat your actions with a keyboard shortcut, making it easy to do over and over.</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, the macro feature in PyCharm is okay, but it isn’t as good as in some other tools. Ultraedit and Notepad++, while not IDEs, both have very sophisticated macro features such as the ability to replay a macro until it reaches the end of the file, or to run the macro a specific number of times. PyCharm’s macros are fine for small jobs, but for bigger ones you might<a id="_idIndexMarker1447"/> look to other tools.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-392"><a id="_idTextAnchor409"/>Notifications</h2>
<p>Sometimes PyCharm will present notifications<a id="_idIndexMarker1448"/> as toast windows in the lower-right corner of the screen. These messages will usually disappear within a few seconds, but you can see them in the notifications panel. You’ll find this panel on the right-hand toolbar, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.11</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.14: The notifications panel" src="img/B19644_16_014.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.14: The notifications panel</p>
<p>You can toggle the panel by clicking the <em class="italic">bell</em> icon on the right-hand toolbar. The panel has a <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> option that allows you to list notifications by recency. You can choose to dismiss any notifications<a id="_idIndexMarker1449"/> you no longer need, or clear them all.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-393"><a id="_idTextAnchor410"/>New features in 2023.2</h1>
<p>During the course<a id="_idIndexMarker1450"/> of writing this book, a lot has changed, especially in the UI. I used build #PY-231.8109.197, or as I like to call it, <em class="italic">the fightin’ 197th</em>. I kept the same release in play for the entire time, neglecting to install any updates because I wanted things to be consistent. Right about the time I started working on <a href="B19644_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor318"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, JetBrains held an online event revealing a new point release, 2023.2. The new release is packed with new features, but today as I write <a href="B19644_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor401"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a> (this chapter), two more point releases have come out. This pace is probably due in large part to JetBrain’s re-vamp of the UI. If you remember at the beginning of the book, we had to turn the “new UI” on in the settings. By the time you read this, the new UI will be the default. JetBrains didn’t stop there. The UI has always been highly configurable, and we covered that thoroughly in the early chapters of this book.</p>
<p>One of the main pushes<a id="_idIndexMarker1451"/> in the new UI effort has been to streamline the development process. Most IDEs go through a cycle of growth where they start with a simple and focused UI that integrates the minimal features needed to be considered an IDE versus an enhanced text editor. Over time, more and more features are added with the aim of giving you a tool that does everything you might need. It occurred to me just the other day that on days when I am 100% focused on Python development, or even JavaScript, web, or database development, all I’d really need is a lightweight OS and PyCharm. I wouldn’t even need a window manager beyond what is needed to run PyCharm!</p>
<p>The problem caused by the richness of such a tool is it becomes daunting for new users, and disorganized for veteran users. We learned in <a href="B19644_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor379"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a> that most new features of any JetBrains IDE are implemented as plugins. This can lead to a disorganized UI and it can make the IDE feel like it is a bunch of unrelated pieces cobbled together in a sub-optimal overall user experience.</p>
<p>The new UI aims to take care of this by compacting the UI, exposing the most commonly used tools and hiding (but not removing) the more complicated options. The build I used for the book did this very well. As newer point releases come out, I’m noticing further efforts to hide complexitity. Take look at <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.13</em>.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.15: JetBrains has moved a lot of settings into tags instead of having dozens of checkboxes</p>
<p>This is a run configuration<a id="_idIndexMarker1452"/> from the latest update released only days ago, labeled as Build #PY-232.9559.58 built August 22, 2023. There are two visible differences. There is a set of tags at the bottom and a <strong class="bold">Modify Options</strong> dropdown both indicated by arrows in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.13</em>. Compare this to <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.14</em>.</p>

<p>All those options are still there, but they’ve been rolled up into the <strong class="bold">Modify Options</strong> dropdown. The settings you’ve actually used appear as tags at the bottom of <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.13</em>. The amount of change over only a few months is staggering!</p>
<p>In addition to product<a id="_idIndexMarker1453"/> changes, there are some interesting new feature additions and improvements.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-394"><a id="_idTextAnchor411"/>Black integration</h2>
<p>First presented at PyCon 2019, Black<a id="_idIndexMarker1454"/> is an uncompromising<a id="_idIndexMarker1455"/> code formatter. It has gained a great deal of attention and popularity since its release, and JetBrains has added support to PyCharm. Black needs to be installed in order for this feature to work. You can find details on installation and more at <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">https://github.com/psf/black</a>. If you are using Linux, check your package manager. I use Pop_OS, which is based<a id="_idIndexMarker1456"/> on Ubuntu. <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.15</em> shows I’ve found Black<a id="_idIndexMarker1457"/> as a package and I prefer to install it that way.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.17: In Linux, you can probably install Black using your package manager" src="img/B19644_16_017.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.17: In Linux, you can probably install Black using your package manager</p>
<p>Once Black is installed, you need to turn it on on a per-project basis. You’ll find this option when you search for Black in the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> dialog shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.16</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.18: Search for Black in the Settings dialog and you’ll find it under Tools" src="img/B19644_16_018.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.18: Search for Black in the Settings dialog and you’ll find it under Tools</p>
<p>Your options for formatting are <code>development</code>. On my team, we individually branch off development into feature branches. If I’m working on some new feature, I’ll branch off <code>development</code> and make a new branch called <code>feature/amazing-thing</code>. Next, I’ll create my amazing thing, but I’ll need to touch some other files written by other developers along the way. Naturally, before I commit, muscle memory automatically uses the <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">Alt</em> + <em class="italic">L</em> (reformat code) command to reformat. Black will reformat the whole file. When you go to merge, you may find other developers have changed some of the same files you re-formatted, but they were less conscientious about reformatting. You are presented with the challenge of an ugly merge even if there were only a few lines actually changed between the two developers, and they might not have otherwise collided.</p>
<p>This is no fault<a id="_idIndexMarker1460"/> of the Black formatter! The same thing will happen<a id="_idIndexMarker1461"/> if you use PyCharm’s default code formatter. The Black formatter, though, is a better solution since it aims for determinism, which is a fancy coder word that means the results of an operation always produce the same output. A non-compromising deterministic formatter should yield very consistent results every time it is used.</p>
<p>My advice, then, if you want to start using Black is to get together as a team. Have everyone push their work, merge it into a branch, and then apply Black to the whole project. In my example, I would resolve my conflicts, and then merge back into the development branch. Then I would have all my colleagues do the same. Once development has everyone’s changes, freeze the code and use Black on all your source files. During the freeze, nobody is allowed to work on any individual file until the formatting has been applied and pushed. If you have a very large code base, you might have to organize your efforts over time. The results will be worth it! Your code will be PEP-8 compliant, and you should see fewer merge conflicts, especially those caused by formatting.</p>
<p>Black can be configured to run on save, and beyond the scope of PyCharm, Black can be used as a hook in your revision control, as well as in your CI/CD process.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-395"><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>GitLab integration</h2>
<p>GitHub is easily the most popular <a id="_idIndexMarker1462"/>and widely used cloud-based solution<a id="_idIndexMarker1463"/> for managing code. Its Achilles heel is the fact that it is cloud-based. Organizations that are serious about security, such as those whose trading<a id="_idIndexMarker1464"/> partners require a certification such as the <strong class="bold">Service Organization Control 2</strong> (<strong class="bold">SOC2</strong>) certification are often not satisfied with their intellectual property being hosted on a publicly available platform. While it’s true you can host private repositories on GitHub, the mere fact that the files are not on a server controlled by the certified organization can be a problem.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it is possible to host your own private GitHub server using GitLab. You can run GitLab on-premises behind your firewall and exercise total control over your security and infrastructure while still using what is in every other sense, the GitHub experience. You’ll find GitLab integration in the <strong class="bold">Version Control</strong> settings as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.17</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.19: GitLab settings can be found alongside the other VCS settings" src="img/B19644_16_019.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.19: GitLab settings can be found alongside the other VCS settings</p>
<p>The integration is fairly deep. Beyond<a id="_idIndexMarker1465"/> the basics we covered in <a href="B19644_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor112"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, you can handle all your pull<a id="_idIndexMarker1466"/> requests, approvals, and more right from the IDE.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-396"><a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Run anywhere</h2>
<p>We’ve had <strong class="bold">Search everywhere</strong> for quite a while. In case you missed it, you can double-tap the <strong class="bold">Shift</strong> key and get a dialog<a id="_idIndexMarker1467"/> that allows you to find anything anywhere in your project. This works even if what you’re looking for isn’t in code. It could be in documentation, settings, or elsewhere.</p>
<p>New to PyCharm, though<a id="_idIndexMarker1468"/> not necessarily new to IntelliJ is <code>?</code>) in the dialog.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.20: Double-tap the Ctrl key to bring up the Run Anything dialog</p>
<p>It’s nice enough<a id="_idIndexMarker1469"/> to say, “<em class="italic">You can run ANYTHING!”</em> But all you critical<a id="_idIndexMarker1470"/> thinkers out there will immediately follow up with, <em class="italic">“What do you mean by ANYTHING?” </em>Here, the answer to my question mark tells me what can be run. I can see I can run any Python script in my project by simply typing its name. I can see I can run <code>pip</code> and <code>conda</code> commands as well. Web developers<a id="_idIndexMarker1471"/> can run the HTTP<a id="_idIndexMarker1472"/> request test code we covered in <a href="B19644_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor223"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>. They can also run all the popular package managers such as <code>package.json</code> file via npm, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1476"/> is visibly supported. Naturally, we can also<a id="_idIndexMarker1477"/> run any <strong class="bold">Node</strong> process as easily as we can run <a id="_idIndexMarker1478"/>Python.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-397"><a id="_idTextAnchor414"/>AI Assistant</h2>
<p>The show stealer at most of the recent events<a id="_idIndexMarker1479"/> featuring PyCharm<a id="_idIndexMarker1480"/> is the AI Assistant. As I write this, the feature is in closed beta, meaning you have to sign up and be approved in order to try out the feature. Bear in mind that anything I show here will probably change.</p>
<p>The easiest thing to implement, and there are numerous plugins that do this, is to just provide an integrated frontend experience for some online AI API.</p>
<p>In contrast, you’ll find the AI Assistant integrated throughout PyCharm. To use the AI Assistant, use the right-hand menu shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.19</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.21: The AI Assistant can be activated using the button on the right-hand menu" src="img/B19644_16_021.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.21: The AI Assistant can be activated using the button on the right-hand menu</p>
<p>The preceding dialog summarizes <a id="_idIndexMarker1481"/>the features<a id="_idIndexMarker1482"/> available. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">This feature is not local</p>
<p class="callout">If your company or environment has a restriction on sending code out to an API such as ChatGPT, you need to know that this feature does exactly that. The functionality is not self-contained within PyCharm and <strong class="bold">any code or information you enter will be sent out to various external third-party APIs</strong>. This is documented in the agreement you blindly scrolled through and ignored so you could get to use PyCharm and the cool new AI features.</p>
<h3>Explain code</h3>
<p>There are many circumstances<a id="_idIndexMarker1483"/> where you might encounter code you don’t understand. My normal mode of describing these circumstances is pretty colorful, especially at 2 A.M. the day before a deadline. I’ll endeavor to keep it professional:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was written by someone else who clearly has no idea what they are doing.</li>
<li>It was written by someone else who is clearly better at this than you are. Sometimes this might be the same person depending on the time of day.</li>
<li>It was written by someone who loves terse code despite it being an anti-pattern in Python.</li>
<li>The code contains a regular expression you have not committed to memory, since no normal human understands regular expressions even though they pretend otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>In circumstances such as these, help is a mouse-click away. Highlight the code in question, right-click, and select <strong class="bold">AI Assistant Action | Explain code</strong>. Seconds later, the AI will give you a breakdown<a id="_idIndexMarker1484"/> of the selected code.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Bear in mind that the AI Assistant is not always correct, and doesn’t always give completely sound advice.</p>
<h3>Answer programming questions</h3>
<p>In truth, the AI Assistant will answer any question<a id="_idIndexMarker1485"/> you ask. I’ve asked it questions about nginx configuration, Docker, and general networking questions. Of course, it also answers programming questions.</p>
<h3>Create commit messages</h3>
<p>This one is really neat! I’m a huge fan<a id="_idIndexMarker1486"/> of the XKCD online comic and their treatment of Git in many comics is spot-on. This one comes to mind right now: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1296/">https://xkcd.com/1296/</a>.</p>
<p>Since the IDE can see your change list, it can generate a commit message for you as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.20</em>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.22: Commit messages are generated that are more deep and meaningful than “I changed a bunch of stuff”" src="img/B19644_16_022.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.22: Commit messages are generated that are more deep and meaningful than “I changed a bunch of stuff”</p>
<p>Maybe you don’t put much stock in your commit messages. I’ve worked on US Government projects where the commit messages were audited. This wasn’t generally known by the development team who, upon learning of this, opted to rebase and re-create every commit to remove their more colorful language within the commit messages. The audit wasn’t really looking for that; it was being used to validate the change control process. My team is currently going through SOC2 certification, and I can tell you firsthand that complete and descriptive commit messages are seriously helpful. As cybersecurity continues to invade developer workflows, you can bet this feature will prove its value to you sooner<a id="_idIndexMarker1487"/> or later.</p>
<h3>Generate documentation</h3>
<p>Do you hate writing<a id="_idIndexMarker1488"/> docstrings? That’s a trick question. If you’re a software developer, you probably think that the code itself is all the documentation anyone could ever need. But you’ve also seen the power of well-documented code when using the documentation features both in the main UI and in SciView. Wouldn’t it be nice if your own functions were as well documented without the need for you to write that documentation yourself? <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.21</em> shows me generating a docstring for a function in one of my projects.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.23: Don’t write documentation, generate it" src="img/B19644_16_023.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.23: Don’t write documentation, generate it</p>
<p>Documentation in this case is really just another form of boilerplate. You should let the IDE generate that for you, then maybe improve on what it creates if needed.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-398"><a id="_idTextAnchor415"/>Jupyter Notebook support for Polars</h2>
<p>While pandas is great, for big data, it is too slow. Spark<a id="_idIndexMarker1489"/> and other big data frameworks<a id="_idIndexMarker1490"/> can help but only by scaling<a id="_idIndexMarker1491"/> horizontally, which involves setting up multiple compute nodes on your network. <strong class="bold">Polars</strong> is a data science library designed to allow<a id="_idIndexMarker1492"/> you to work with large data without resorting to using multiple computers and has long been a requested feature in PyCharm. If your DataFrame fits in your computer’s memory, you can use it in Polars and view it in PyCharm just as you would any other DataFrame.</p>
<p>Furthermore, PyCharm supports the <strong class="bold">Plotly</strong> library for visualization, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1493"/> uniquely works with Polars DataFrames. When you combine PyCharm’s support for these advanced libraries, you can overcome<a id="_idIndexMarker1494"/> many of the obstacles<a id="_idIndexMarker1495"/> that are normally cited as detractors<a id="_idIndexMarker1496"/> for using Polars.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-399"><a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>Summary and closing remarks</h1>
<p>We have covered a great deal in a short time! At least it feels this way for me since in many of these chapters it was extremely tempting to jump into a tutorial on the subject we were covering. For example, in the Flask and Django chapters, I felt “wrong” about not giving you a tutorial on Flask and Django. I didn’t do so because those are quite literally books unto themselves both within and outside of the Packt library.</p>
<p>We learned that the point of an IDE is to offer you a full suite of tools for every development task you might perform on a daily basis. When viewed through that lens, PyCharm is an amazing IDE that really has very few competitors.</p>
<p>We saw how the basics around setting up a simple Python project are made easy by automating processes such as creating a virtual environment. The Professional edition of PyCharm has many additional features for project creation, mostly centered around project templates for the most popular types of projects in the areas of general software development, full stack web development, and data science. There is even a special edition for educational use, which allows you to create interactive lessons that play out directly in the IDE. We didn’t talk about that one, but if you’re interested, I’ll leave a link in the <em class="italic">Further </em><em class="italic">reading</em> section.</p>
<p>Full stack web developers have a huge chunk of PyCharm’s tooling dedicated just to their work. We saw all the major frameworks supported, and the support isn’t even limited to Python. PyCharm can do anything WebStorm can do with respect the JavaScript development and working with modern JavaScript UI frameworks such as Angular, Vue, Vite, and React.</p>
<p>PyCharm has truly complete tooling for interacting with relational and non-relational databases. This feature set is mainly from DataGrip, a different IDE from JetBrains focused completely on databases, in particular on creating and development relational structures. It has full support for MongoDB and Redis, which are two that I use daily. Where I would normally need to flip to tools such as Studio 3T or Redis Insights, I can instead just stay in PyCharm. The diversity of platforms supported is staggering! There are dozens of supported databases, and sometimes it can be fun to just look at the list and go look up the ones you’ve never heard of.</p>
<p>After covering databases, we learned about the boon that PyCharm brings to the field of data science. You can use what I’ll call a light version of Jupyter Notebooks by leveraging code cells in IPython. I’m not a daily data science guy at work, but sometimes I like to pretend that I am. The code cell features covered in <em class="italic">Chapters 12</em> and <em class="italic">13</em> are useful for tasks such as integrating multiple APIs or microservices together. I can create a prototype script using cells that draw data from different APIs or microservices, toss them into a pandas DataFrame, and I can use SciView to see the results even if I don’t need to keep the DataFrame calls in my real program. Just being able to visualize the data in several easy tables rendered next to each other can be a big help.</p>
<p>If you are a data science practitioner, your support grows with tools such as Jupyter Notebooks integration making PyCharm a one-stop tool for your whole workflow. That’s the point of the tool for its three different audiences.</p>
<p>When Packt asked me to write this book, I was excited and daunted. I was excited because I had just learned that LinkedIn Learning had taken down my PyCharm course, and that was one of my personal favorites. This book offered me the opportunity to do a deeper dive than you can do in a 2-hour video course. If 2-hour video courses are your thing I have one left on LinkedIn covering developing APIs with Flask. I doubt they’ll keep it up much longer, so if you’re interested, be sure to check it out before they take it down. I’ll put a link in the <em class="italic">Further reading</em> section. My newer video courses can be found on my course website, <a href="https://maddevskilz.com">https://maddevskilz.com</a>. Naturally, anything about Python will feature PyCharm as the IDE.</p>
<p>The idea (.idea?) of writing this book was daunting because there is so much packed (Packt?) into this IDE and I actually do know what I don’t know. I don’t know everything. I definitely found features I didn’t know were there when I started. I probably got some things wrong. That’s OK (I hope). Ending this book is a single point in time on a journey that, for me, started seven years ago when I got fed up with Visual Studio and web development in C# in general. When I saw how easy it was to create applications in Flask, and then again how easy PyCharm made it for a total n00b like me to actually get real work done, I was hooked. Writing a book like this is a huge responsibility with potentially a huge impact. Coding is a legitimate superpower. Unlike most superpowers in the movies, it is a superpower that can be taught. There is no need to come from a far-away planet, get bitten by a radioactive spider, or get injected with an experimental serum. While some of that might help, all you really need is grit, curiosity, and to put in the hard work. If you master this craft even a little bit, you can do great things.</p>
<p>I’ve had the opportunity to create software that helps choose treatment modalities for prostate cancer patients. The project didn’t wind up going anywhere, but a year after I had shelved the project my father called and told me he had just gotten a diagnosis for prostate cancer. The extra moral of this story is to never delete your old repos! My father was a pathologist himself, and with the help of the doctor who created the algorithm, we ran my dad’s numbers through the program and the resulting treatment gave me another 8 years with him.</p>
<p>I’ve also been part of projects designed to help keep my country safe, train pilots in the US Marine Corps, and to manage IT assets. When I was working on these projects, they were just projects. They were deadlines I had to meet, and they were sources of stress. But every piece of software published, indeed every line of code we write has the potential to help make the world around us a better place! Sometimes the benefits are obvious, as with the cancer treatment software. Even software with a mundane purpose, such as enterprise storage capacity planning, can have far-reaching benefits since this too is a tool for enabling others to do what they do and build what they build.</p>
<p>Consider too, our superpower works at scale. Superman can only be in one place at one time; a fact too frequently exploited by various supervillains. We are not limited in this way. There are apps in multiple app stores that can help dyslexic children learn to read. That one app downloaded tens of thousands of times can educate generations that would be marginalized or ignored by the public education systems of most countries, which value test scores and funding over outcomes.</p>
<p>You have a superpower! Use it! These tools make it easier! If I’ve hooked even one person and they get the benefit from this tool and this language that I have gotten since I started, then for me, this book is a wild success.</p>

- en: So far, we have learned how to build, monitor, and log serverless functions.
    In this chapter, we will be learning concepts and engineering techniques that
    will help scale up serverless applications to be distributed, and that will also
    enable them to handle heavy workloads with high standards of security and throughput.
    In this chapter, we will also use some third-party tools, such as Ansible, to
    scale up our Lambda functions. We will be scaling up our Lambda functions to spawn
    a distributed serverless architecture, which will involve spawning multiple servers
    (or instances in the AWS environment). You therefore need to keep that in mind
    while following the examples mentioned in this chapter.

    roadblocks and problems, and the fact that the concept of serverless systems is
    still in a very infantile stage, means that most of those problems are still unsolved.
    But, that shouldn't stop us from trying to solve and work around these roadblocks.

    is important to address this as one too many architects/software engineers fell
    and fall into the overestimation or the underestimation trap. The problem we will
    try to address is the exact number of instances you have to launch when scaling
    up. In most self-hosted MapReduce-style systems, it is taken care of out of the
    box.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This problem can be taken care of, by properly benchmarking the workloads beforehand
    on different types of instances, and scale accordingly. Let's understand this
    by taking an example of a machine learning pipeline. Thanks to our benchmarking
    efforts, we already know that an *m3.medium* instance can handle 100 files in
    10 minutes. So, if my workload has 202 files and I want it to be completed in
    close to 10 minutes, I would like to have two such instances for handling this.
    Even if we don't know the workloads in advance, we can write a Python script for
    getting that number from wherever the data is, be it an SQS queue pointer, or
    S3, or some other database; and that number can be entered into the Ansible script
    and make the playbook run.

    we will keep this short. There are several complex data movements happening inside
    a large distributed serverless workload. Using proper security protocols and monitoring
    them, as mentioned in detail in the previous security section, will help in overcoming
    this problem.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Logging is a major problem in distributed serverless systems, which is also
    still unsolved completely. As the systems and containers are destroyed once the
    workload has been completed, logging has been a very difficult task to undertake. There
    are several ways you can log the workflow. The most popular ones are logging every
    Ansible task separately, and one where the last Ansible task is to zip up the
    logs and send the zipped file to a data store, such as S3 or Logstash. The last
    one is the most preferred way as it captures the execution flow better, as the
    entire log trace is in a single file.

    unsolved problem. As the servers are all terminated once the workload is run,
    we can''t poll for historic logs from the servers, and latency also will not be
    tolerated, or more precisely, will not be possible. Monitor every task of Ansible
    by having a task after each, that sends a custom metric to CloudWatch upon a condition
    that the previous task has executed successfully or not. This will look something

    if you are not quick, the entire system can be terminated before you even get
    a chance to look at the logs. Also, Ansible emits very verbose logs while debugging,
    which might seem overwhelming when spawning several instances.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some basic Unix hacks can help in handling these problems. The most important
    one is to monitor the tail of the log file, about 50 lines or so. This helps in
    not getting overwhelmed by the huge amount of logs, and it also keeps an eye on
    the execution of the Ansible notebook.

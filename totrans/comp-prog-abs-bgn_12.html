			<p>If we look at all the programming languages, we can see patterns and similarities between them, and we can use these to classify them into different paradigms. The word <strong class="bold">paradigm</strong> means a <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>typical example or pattern of something, and this is precisely what we are looking for in programming languages when grouping them.</p>
			<p>The reason we want to do this classification is because the way we write a program in one of these groups will differ significantly from how we do so in languages belonging to another group.</p>
			<p>A computer program will almost always, in one way or another, model something in the real world. We are solving real-world problems using software. The question is how best we can model and represent real-world things in code and how best we can structure the solution we have to this real-world problem.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn about the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding structured programming</li>
				<li>Understanding object-oriented programming</li>
				<li>Understanding functional programming</li>
				<li>Understanding logic programming</li>
				<li>Understanding other paradigms</li>
				<li>Understanding multi-paradigm languages</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's begin with the paradigm that we are most familiar with: structured programming.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Understanding structured programming</h1>
			<p>Structured programming <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>is what we have looked at in this book. Loops, conditionals, and functions define the flow of a program that uses this paradigm. If you have read the previous chapters of this book, then they should all be familiar to you by now. </p>
			<p>Structured programming <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>is a branch of a family of paradigms called <strong class="bold">imperative programming</strong>. Languages that<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> use the concepts of imperative programming use statements to change the program's state. </p>
			<p>If we look at that definition, we must first learn what statements and program state are.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Statements</h2>
			<p>In the first part of this<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> definition, we'll talk about statements. A statement, as described in <a href="B15554_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sequence – The Basic Building Block of a Computer Program</em>, in the <em class="italic">Understanding statements</em> section, this can be viewed as a command that we give to the application. In natural language, we have something that is called the imperative mood. The imperative mood is something that forms a command, such as <em class="italic">Move!</em>, <em class="italic">Don't be late!</em>, or <em class="italic">Work hard!</em>. In imperative programming, we give instructions to the computer with something that is like the imperative mood; that is, a command that is expressed in the form of a statement.</p>
			<p>That is the first half of the definition of imperative programming. The second part talks about changing the program's state.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Program state</h2>
			<p>A program<a id="_idIndexMarker584"/> is said to have a state if it remembers previous events that have occurred. A program stores data in variables. At any given point, during the program's execution, we can look at the data that is currently in all the variables we have defined. The combined value in all these variables is what makes up the state of the program.</p>
			<p>If we change one variable, the state of the program will also change. When we are talking about imperative programming, we mean that as soon as a statement changes the content of a variable, it has changed the program state.</p>
			<p>This is what forms the memory of preceding events. When an event – a statement, in our case – occurs and it changes a variable, it will affect the behavior of the program. If we have an application that will launch a rocket, we might have a function that takes care of the countdown. To keep track of what number we are currently at, we need to have a variable. Changing this variable during the countdown will change the state of the application. When the variable reaches zero, it will trigger the event of sending the start signal to the rocket.</p>
			<p>If this is imperative programming, how are things different in structured programming? Let's compare them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Comparing imperative and structured programming</h2>
			<p>Programs written in <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>assembly language use a <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>concept known as GOTOs. It is a <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>technique that's used to control the flow in a program. To use them, we insert labels into the code, and we can then instruct the program to jump to one such label and resume its execution there.</p>
			<p>A small code snippet of assembly language can illustrate this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">	mov eax,3 	jump exit 	mov eax,123  ; &lt;- not executed!exit:	ret</p>
			<p>Here, we have a label called <strong class="source-inline">exit</strong>. On the first line, we move the value <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> into a register (remember that a register in an assembly is like a variable) called <strong class="source-inline">eax</strong>. On the second line, we do an unconditional jump to our label, <strong class="source-inline">exit</strong>. The jump being unconditional means that we will always do this jump. In the assembly language, there are also conditional jumps where we only jump if a register is equal to, less than, or higher than some value.</p>
			<p>Since the jump is unconditional, line three will never execute as we will always jump past this line.</p>
			<p>Many languages that came into existence in the 60s and 70s also had the same concept of an unconditional jump. Here, we can find languages such as BASIC and C. In these languages, it is not called a jump. Instead, the term <em class="italic">GOTO</em> is used. The programming language C++ is based upon C, so it also uses GOTO. The same program written in C++ will look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">	int x = 3;</p>
			<p class="source-code">	goto quit;</p>
			<p class="source-code">	x = 123;	   // &lt;- not executed!</p>
			<p class="source-code">quit:</p>
			<p class="source-code">	return x;</p>
			<p>Today, it is, under most circumstances, considered a bad practice to use GOTOs as the code will be hard to read, understand, and maintain. There is hardly ever any need to perform a GOTO as languages such as BASIC and C support constructs that can let us achieve the same result and maintain good code quality. </p>
			<p>Using this style of <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>programming was what<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> first defined imperative programming. As programming languages developed and we got other tools, such as loops, <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements, and functions, there was a need to distinguish these more modern languages from the older style. Even though these programming languages use the same ideas as assembly language, these statements will change the state of the program. This is because they no longer rely on jumps or GOTOs to accomplish this. This was when we got the definition structured programming. A language that supports structured programming is a language that modifies the state of the program using statements and has functions, loops, and <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements as tools to accomplish this.</p>
			<p>We will sometimes also hear the terms <em class="italic">procedural</em> and <em class="italic">modular</em> languages. There is no need to go into the details of what the difference is between these as this is mostly academic. We can safely consider all these the same thing. </p>
			<p>Some well-known languages that support structured programming or their relatives, procedural and imperative programming, are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ada</li>
				<li>ALGOL</li>
				<li>BASIC</li>
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>COBOL</li>
				<li>Fortran</li>
				<li>Go</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>Pascal</li>
				<li>Perl</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Ruby</li>
				<li>Rust</li>
				<li>Swift</li>
				<li>Visual Basic</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Structured programming is a<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> popular paradigm, as <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>this long list of languages proves. In the 90s, another paradigm gained popularity and is still one of the essential paradigms in use. It is called object-oriented programming. Let's see what this is about.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Understanding object-orientated programming</h1>
			<p>The main<a id="_idIndexMarker592"/> idea within object-oriented programming is to model the code in the same way as we as humans look at the world. </p>
			<p>Even if you've never thought about it, we are always classifying things and grouping things together using abstraction. We can talk about vehicles, and we have shared knowledge of what is included in this group. Cars, bicycles, boats, and airplanes are, while pencils, ducks, and swimsuits are not.</p>
			<p>I could say, <em class="italic">I need to go to town. Can anyone lend me a vehicle?</em></p>
			<p>You will interpret this in such a way that the actual kind does not matter, but it must be something that can transport me to town. It could just as well be a car as it could be a skateboard.</p>
			<p>Grouping things into these abstractions make our lives easier as we will not go into details every single time, we talk about something. I can ask for a vehicle instead of describing that I need a device that can transport me from my current location to town.</p>
			<p>Things within such an abstraction can be very different, but if they share some key characteristics, we will understand it. Take a look at the following image. Here, we have two items that can both be grouped into something that we can call remote controls.</p>
			<p>One of them will<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> control your TV and let you change channels and change the volume. The other one will let you lock and unlock your car:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer149" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.1_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Remote controls"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – Remote controls</p>
			<p>Even though they work with different devices and the result of pushing their buttons will be very different, they share the behavior in that they control something from a distance wirelessly. We have labeled these devices remote controls to make our communication more convenient.</p>
			<p>What if we could do the same when writing software? This is where object orientation comes in. It will let us use the same approach.</p>
			<p>If we are going to write a program that keeps track of the warehouse inventory and we want to do so object-oriented style, we can look at a real warehouse and describe it just as we see it.</p>
			<p>In the warehouse, we have things such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Products</li>
				<li>Shelves</li>
				<li>A coffee machine</li>
				<li>Warehouse employees</li>
				<li>A dead flower in the window</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Our system will need to know about some of these things, but not all of them. In the preceding list, we can ignore the flower and the coffee machine, but the other three are good candidates for making it into our program.</p>
			<p>If we look at one of these products, we will see that it can be several things, all the way from tiny screws and bolts to machines or devices of some sort. But from the perspective of a warehouse, they share the same characteristics. They are all items that we store, and we can describe them using the same attributes. They have a name, a weight, and manufacturer; we have a certain amount of them; and so on.</p>
			<p>In object-oriented programming, we try to preserve this way of describing things and represent them in a way that is not too different from how we just described them here.</p>
			<p>To understand how object-oriented programming works, we will need to break it down into some main concepts that we will need to understand. Let's check them out.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Classes and objects</h2>
			<p>In object-orientated programming, a class<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> is like a blueprint, or description, of <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>something. Let's take the concept of a person as an example. How can we describe a person? We can start to make a list of things that apply to all people. It might look something like this.</p>
			<p>A person has the following attributes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A name</li>
				<li>An age</li>
				<li>A gender</li>
				<li>Height</li>
				<li>Weight</li>
				<li>Hair color</li>
				<li>Eye color</li>
				<li>Shoe size</li>
				<li>Nationality</li>
				<li>Address</li>
				<li>Telephone number</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The list can go on. We can <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>now decide that these are things that apply to all people. If we think about it, this is all data about a person. We have not described any behavior. We could make another list that describes things a person can do.</p>
			<p>A person can do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Jump</li>
				<li>Run</li>
				<li>Walk</li>
				<li>Sit</li>
				<li>Stand</li>
				<li>Sleep</li>
				<li>Chill</li>
				<li>Work</li>
				<li>Play</li>
				<li>Dance</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The same thing applies here – this list can be very long.</p>
			<p>If we are going to represent a person in a program, we won't need all the available data and behavior. Instead, we need to make an abstract of a person in such a way that we can represent them with the things that are interesting for us. Name, age, and sex might all be such things, but shoe size will most likely not be unless we are writing an application for a shoe store. Let's focus on the data and pick some things that might be interesting enough to implement in an application. We might pick the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Age (most likely in the form of date of birth)</li>
				<li>Gender</li>
				<li>Address</li>
				<li>Nationality</li>
				<li>Phone number</li>
				<li>Email address</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, we'll learn how to <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>define a blueprint – called a class in object-oriented programming – for a person since we have a list of data that applies to all people.</p>
			<p>We give it a descriptive name and list the things we are interested in. It might look something like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer150" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.2_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – A class called person"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – A class called person</p>
			<p>The preceding image depicts a class in a simplified way; that is, a rectangle with three sections. In the top section, we have the name that we have given this class. In the middle section, we've described the data we want to use to describe a person. The last section is for behavior, which is something we will come back to soon.</p>
			<p>Object-oriented programming is very focused around data, so when we're deciding what a class will look like, this is often where we start. The data that makes it into our class will often dictate what kind of behavior we want it to have. This behavior often dictates the operations we need to perform on the data.</p>
			<p>The behavior we identified for a person earlier, such as jump, run, and sleep, will most likely not be something we will need to represent. Instead, we will usually find things that will modify the data, such as changing the address.</p>
			<p>For now, we will leave the third section of the class empty, but we will come back to it later.</p>
			<p>Now, we have a class and the blueprint for a person, but we haven't represented any actual people yet. A representation of a thing – in our case, a person – is called an <em class="italic">object</em>. An object <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>will always <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>belong to a class. Now that we have a class, we can create an object from it, and each object will represent one person.</p>
			<p>If we have a group of people that we want to represent in our application, a representation of them could look as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer151" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.3_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Four objects from the person class"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – Four objects from the person class</p>
			<p>As we can see in the preceding diagram, all four objects have their own set of data; a name, a date of birth, a gender, an <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>address, a nationality, a phone number, and an email address. The data in one object is independent of the data in other objects that belong to the same class. If we change the address in one object, it will not affect any other object.</p>
			<p>To summarize this, we can state that a class is a model or the blueprint for the objects. The data that is defined within <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>the class is often referred to as <strong class="bold">member variables</strong> or <strong class="bold">attributes</strong>.</p>
			<h3>Member variables</h3>
			<p>A member variable<a id="_idIndexMarker602"/> is just like any other variable, with one key difference: it lives inside of an object.</p>
			<p>To illustrate this, we can consider a very minimal class for a person. It could look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">class Person</p>
			<p class="source-code">	name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	age</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_class</p>
			<p>Here, we're defining a class called <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong>. It has two variables inside it: <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>.</p>
			<p>At this point, no actual variables exist in the computer's memory as this is just a blueprint for what a person object will look like. To make them come into existence, we need to create objects, often referred to as instances, from this class. </p>
			<p>This can be done like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">p1 = Person("Dipika", 34)</p>
			<p class="source-code">p2 = Person("Manfred", 58)</p>
			<p>This creates two objects. We use the variable names <strong class="source-inline">p1</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">p2</strong> to reference them. The interesting part is what happens when we create these objects. If we take a closer look at line one, we will see that a chain of events will occur:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The first thing that happens is that, somewhere in the computer's memory, an object from the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class is created with a set of two variables called <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>, as shown in the<a id="_idIndexMarker603"/> following image<div id="_idContainer152" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Fig_10.4_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – An object from the person class"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.4 – An object from the person class</p></li>
				<li>The next step is that the member variables get initialized with the data we passed in when we created the object. This is illustrated in the following image:<div id="_idContainer153" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/Fig_10.5_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.5 – The member variables in the object are initialized"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.5 – The member variables in the object are initialized</p></li>
				<li>The last step is that the <strong class="source-inline">p1</strong> variable now points out where in memory this object is located, as illustrated in the following image:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer154" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.6_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – The object is referenced by the p1 variable"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.6 – The object is referenced by the p1 variable</p>
			<p>Then, this process is <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>repeated for the object that contains the name <strong class="source-inline">Manfred</strong>. By doing this, we get something that looks similar to the following:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer155" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.7_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.7 – Two objects from the Person class"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.7 – Two objects from the Person class</p>
			<p>Now that we have two objects, we can see that we have two variables called <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>. One of each is inside the <strong class="source-inline">p1</strong> object and the <strong class="source-inline">p2</strong> object. For every object we create from the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class, we will get a new set of these two.</p>
			<p>We will soon change this class, but as it <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>looks now, we can access these variables like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">p1 = Person("Dipika", 34)</p>
			<p class="source-code">p2 = Person("Manfred", 58)</p>
			<p class="source-code">print p1.name</p>
			<p class="source-code">print p1.age</p>
			<p class="source-code">print p2.name</p>
			<p class="source-code">print p2.age</p>
			<p>This will give us the following output:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Dipika</p>
			<p class="source-code">34</p>
			<p class="source-code">Manfred</p>
			<p class="source-code">58</p>
			<p>Object-oriented programming states that member data should be encapsulated within its object and that direct access to this data from the outside should be prevented. Let's see why this is a critical concept in object orientation.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Understanding encapsulation</h2>
			<p>Encapsulation, also known as <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>information hiding, is a concept where the object's internal<a id="_idIndexMarker607"/> implementation is hidden from everything outside the object.</p>
			<p>Encapsulation can be described in many ways. The American computer engineers James Rumbaugh and Michael Blaha described it like this:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">"One design goal is to treat classes as "black boxes," whose external interface is public but whose internal details are hidden from view. Hiding internal information permits implementation of a class to be changed without requiring any clients of the class to modify code."</em></p>
			<p>The vital key here is the <em class="italic">interface</em>. An interface is<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> what we use to communicate with an object. Look at the remote controls in <em class="italic">Figure 10.1</em>. The buttons we can push is the interface. We use them to communicate with the internal logic inside the device.</p>
			<p>The remote control object is a <em class="italic">black box</em> as we can't see the internals of the remote, and there is no need for us to either. The only thing we need to understand to be able to use the object is the interface. If the remote is not working correctly, we can take it to someone who understands the inner workings of it, and they can repair it. If they don't change the interface, the buttons, and what functionality that is associated with them, we won't need to change the way we use the remote before and after the modification.</p>
			<p>One thing we should hide from the outside world is the data. No, wait! If the data is hidden inside an object, how could we then use it? Let's look at an example to see what we mean by hiding the data inside an object.</p>
			<p>If you walk down the street and you meet another person, you cannot, just by observing that person, see things such as the person's name, what they had for breakfast, their age, and where they live. This data is encapsulated inside the object:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer156" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.8_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – Data encapsulated inside a real-world object"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.8 – Data encapsulated inside a real-world object</p>
			<p>To get this information, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>need to ask the person. We say that objects communicate by passing messages to each other. This looks something like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer157" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.9_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.9 – Two objects communicating by sending messages"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.9 – Two objects communicating by sending messages</p>
			<p>We will need to modify our class so that the data is hidden and we have a way to communicate with it.</p>
			<p>We can hide the data by using the <strong class="source-inline">private</strong> keyword. The class will now look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">class Person</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private age</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_class</p>
			<p>By declaring <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> as private, we can no longer access them from outside the class. This means that the lines where we printed the name and age of the two objects will no longer work. </p>
			<p>The class, as it looks now, is useless <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>as we can create an object and assign values to its variables, but there is no way for us to do anything with this data after this point as it is hidden from us. We will need to create an interface, such as the buttons on the remote control, that will let us work with the data. We will do that with the help of class methods.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Class methods</h2>
			<p>A class method<a id="_idIndexMarker611"/> is nothing but a<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> function that belongs to a class. The reason we have a different name for these functions is so that we can distinguish between a function that is part of a class and one that is not. As soon as you hear someone mention a method, you know that it is a function that belongs to a class. </p>
			<p>Two popular methods that we will find in classes are what are called <em class="italic">getters</em> and <em class="italic">setters</em>. A getter<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> is a method that returns the value of a private member variable, while a setter<a id="_idIndexMarker614"/> is a method that lets us change its value.</p>
			<p>To make a method available outside the class, we can use the <strong class="source-inline">public</strong> keyword. To this, we can add getters and setters for our class, and it will then look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">class Person</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private age</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function get_name()</p>
			<p class="source-code">		return name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function set_name(new_name)</p>
			<p class="source-code">		name = new_name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function get_age()</p>
			<p class="source-code">		return age</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function set_age(new_age)</p>
			<p class="source-code">		age = new_age</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_class</p>
			<p>This will give us access to the <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>member variables. We <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>can now create objects, get the private data stored inside of them, and change their value if needed. </p>
			<p>It will look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">p1 = Person("Dipika", 34)</p>
			<p class="source-code">p2 = Person("Manfred", 58)</p>
			<p class="source-code">print p1.get_name() + " is " + p1.get_age() + " year old"</p>
			<p class="source-code">p1.set_age(35)</p>
			<p class="source-code">print p1.get_name() + " is " + p1.get_age() + " year old"</p>
			<p>This will produce the following output:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Dipika is 34 years old</p>
			<p class="source-code">Dipika is 35 years old</p>
			<p>A natural question at this point is why we need to bother having these getters and setters. Why can't we just say that <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> are <strong class="source-inline">public</strong> and let anyone read and change them as they want? The reason is that keeping the data private and controlling access to it through methods will give us control.</p>
			<p>If a stranger walks up to you and asks for your name, you will have some options. You could respond with your actual name, you could tell them that it is none of their business, or you could lie and tell them a different name. You have control over the access to your private data, just as the class will have control over the access to its private data with the help of these methods.</p>
			<p>When the <strong class="source-inline">set_age</strong> method is <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>called, we could, for example, check the value that is being passed in to make sure that it is within a valid range. We <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>could, for example, refuse to set the age if it is a negative number or higher than any expected human age. We could make use of exceptions, which we covered in <a href="B15554_09_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor127"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">When Things Go Wrong – Bugs and  Exceptions</em>, in the <em class="italic">Working with exceptions</em> section. The <strong class="source-inline">set_age</strong> method would then look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">public function set_age(new_age)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    if age &lt; 0 or age &gt; 130 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">       throw ValueError("Error. Age must be between 0 and 130")</p>
			<p class="source-code">    end_if</p>
			<p class="source-code">    age = new_age</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_function</p>
			<p>We will now get an exception if the value that's being passed to the method is below <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> or greater than <strong class="source-inline">130</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now, we can add some class methods to the diagram we looked at previously in <em class="italic">Figure 10.2</em> . In the following image, we can see that we're making use of the lower part of the rectangle for this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer158" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.10_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.10 – A class with member variables and methods"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.10 – A class with member variables and methods</p>
			<p>A class can, of course, have <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>methods other than just getters and setters. It is up to us to decide what methods we want our class to have. Our <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>could, for example, have a method called <strong class="source-inline">birthday</strong> where we increase the age of a person by one, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>
			<p class="source-code">class Person</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private age</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function birthday()</p>
			<p class="source-code">		age = age + 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	// Getters and setters as before are defined here</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_class</p>
			<p>We could now use it like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">p1 = Person("Dipika", 34)</p>
			<p class="source-code">print p1.get_name() + " is " + p1.get_age() + " year old"</p>
			<p class="source-code">p1.birthday()</p>
			<p class="source-code">print p1.get_name() + " is " + p1.get_age() + " year old"</p>
			<p>The output of this program will be the same as it was previously:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Dipika is 34 years old</p>
			<p class="source-code">Dipika is 35 years old</p>
			<p>As we can see, the power of <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>object-oriented programming is that objects are self-contained entities that control their data. But object-oriented programming has another powerful feature that will let us reuse code, and that is the concept of inheritance.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Inheritance</h2>
			<p>If I asked you if I could <a id="_idIndexMarker622"/>borrow your <a id="_idIndexMarker623"/>phone to make a call, it would not matter if you gave me your smartphone, an old mobile phone from 2005, or even access to a landline telephone. They all share some of the same features, with one of them being the ability to make phone calls. We could define this with a chain of statements, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A smartphone is a mobile phone</li>
				<li>A mobile phone is a telephone</li>
				<li>A telephone can make phone calls</li>
				<li>A smartphone can, therefore, make phone calls</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We could say that we have several levels of abstractions where we have a relationship between the levels. This is what we call an <em class="italic">is-a</em> relation. We can illustrate this with the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer159" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.11_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.11 – Is-a relations between telephones"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.11 – Is-a relations between telephones</p>
			<p>We can say that because a smartphone is a mobile phone, it can do anything a mobile phone can. We also know that a smartphone can do things that an old-style mobile phone can't, such as allowing us to use the GPS together with a map app to help us navigate.</p>
			<p>A mobile phone, on the other hand, can do everything the landline telephone can; that is, make and receive calls. But it can<a id="_idIndexMarker624"/> also do other things, such as allow us to send text messages.</p>
			<p>We can also view this<a id="_idIndexMarker625"/> relationship as a parent-child relationship. The smartphone is a child of the mobile phone, and the mobile phone is its parent. This also means that a child will inherit from its parent. This is how inheritance works in object-oriented programming. </p>
			<p>A class can inherit another class, and by that, get everything that is defined in the parent class and just add the things that make this class unique.  To see what this might look like, we will need two classes. We can have a <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class that is defined like the one we saw in <em class="italic">figure 10.10</em>. It might look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">class Person</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private date_of_birth</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private gender</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private address</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private nationality</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private phone_number</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private email_address</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function get_name()</p>
			<p class="source-code">		return name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function set_name(new_name)</p>
			<p class="source-code">		name = new_name</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	</p>
			<p class="source-code">     // Getters and setters for all the other </p>
			<p class="source-code">     // variables are implemented here</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_class</p>
			<p>In this class, we define all the member variables as private members of the class, and all the getters and setters are defined as public.</p>
			<p>The information used here <a id="_idIndexMarker626"/>applies to all people, but we might <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>have some people that we need to store additional information for. This could, for example, be employees. They are people, and by that, all the information we store about a person will apply to them as well, but we have additional data that we want to store about employees. This could be things such as salary and department. We don't want to define them, however, as shown in the following image:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer160" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.12_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.12 – Two classes not using inheritance"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.12 – Two classes not using inheritance</p>
			<p>Here, we can see that <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>everything we have in the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class is repeated in the <strong class="source-inline">Employee</strong> class. The only difference is that we have added <strong class="bold">Salary</strong> and <strong class="bold">Department</strong>. What we can do instead is we can say that the <strong class="source-inline">Employee</strong> class will <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>inherit from the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class and, by that, they automatically get everything that is defined in <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong>. This will look something like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer161" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.13_B15554_New.jpg" alt="Figure 10.13 – Employee inheriting from Person"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.13 – Employee inheriting from Person</p>
			<p>Here, the <strong class="source-inline">Employee</strong> c;ass will<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> inherit everything from <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong>. The <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>only thing we will need to define in the <strong class="source-inline">Employee</strong> class is the things that make this class unique. Just as we usually represent classes with the rectangle with three sections, inheritance is visualized with a hollow, arrow-like symbol, as shown in the preceding image.</p>
			<p>When implementing this inheritance in code, we don't need to make any changes to the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class. So, the <strong class="source-inline">Employee</strong> class will look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">class Employee inherit Person</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private salary</p>
			<p class="source-code">	private department</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function get_salary()</p>
			<p class="source-code">		return salary</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function set_salary(new_salary)</p>
			<p class="source-code">		salary = new_salary</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function get_department()</p>
			<p class="source-code">		return department</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">	public function set_department(new_department)</p>
			<p class="source-code">		department = new_department</p>
			<p class="source-code">	end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_class</p>
			<p>Even though we only have<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> code for the salary and department in this class, from the first line we can say that we inherit the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class.</p>
			<p>Exactly how object-oriented <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>programming is implemented differs from language to language. Languages that support object-orientation will also sometimes have slightly different rules for how object-orientation is used. As always, we will need to learn how the language we are using has defined the object-oriented principles.</p>
			<p>The following is a list of some popular languages that support object orientation, either entirely or as an option:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C++</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Java</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>Object-C</li>
				<li>PHP</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Ruby</li>
				<li>Scala</li>
				<li>Swift</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Object orientation is one of the major paradigms. It has many fans who like it and think it is a good way to structure code. The next paradigm we will look at has been around for a long time but has gained in popularity in the last few years: functional programming. It is now considered one of the more interesting paradigms by many programmers. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Understanding functional programming</h1>
			<p>Functional programming <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>is a paradigm that has gained popularity. It is not new; we can trace its roots back to Lambda calculus, which was introduced in the 1930s. In the 1950s, the programming language Lisp was developed and implemented this paradigm.</p>
			<p>As we will see, this paradigm has a very different approach to how programs are structured and implemented. You will need to rethink the way you look at programming and code structure to be able to understand the strength of this paradigm.</p>
			<p>We will begin by looking at a definition of functional programming. The definition will, itself, be hard to understand, so we will also need to look at some parts of it to understand what this is all about.</p>
			<p>One definition is as follows:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">"Functional programming is a way of structuring a computer program that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing the state of the program and the use of mutable data."</em></p>
			<p>Let's start by deciphering this<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> definition. The <em class="italic">treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions</em> part might sound scary. If we look closely at this, we will see that this is rather straightforward. Let's look at two mathematical functions and see how we can use and understand them in order to understand what the definition of functional programming is talking about.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Pure functions</h2>
			<p>We <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>will start simple <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>with the following function:</p>
			<p><img src="image/Formula_10_001.png" alt=""/></p>
			<p>Here, <em class="italic">x</em> is the input we provide to the function and <em class="italic">y</em> is the result. This simple function just states that whatever we pass a value to it, it will also be returned.  A diagram for this function looks as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer163" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.14_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.14 – Diagram for y = x"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.14 – Diagram for y = x</p>
			<p>Here, we can see that if <strong class="bold">x</strong> is <strong class="bold">1</strong>, <strong class="bold">y</strong> is also <strong class="bold">1</strong> and that if <strong class="bold">x</strong> is <strong class="bold">-3</strong>, <strong class="bold">y</strong> is also <strong class="bold">-3</strong>. What's even more essential for us to understand regarding what the definition talks about is the fact that the same input to <strong class="bold">x</strong> will always yield the same value as a result in <strong class="bold">y</strong>. If we input <strong class="bold">5</strong> for <strong class="bold">x</strong>, we will always get <strong class="bold">5</strong> for <strong class="bold">y</strong>.</p>
			<p>Let's look at another function to see if the same thing is true:</p>
			<p><img src="image/Formula_10_002.png" alt=""/></p>
			<p>This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>function for a straight line. The value of <strong class="bold">m</strong> will define the slope of the<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> line, while <strong class="bold">c</strong> will be the value of <strong class="bold">y</strong> when <em class="italic">x = 0</em>. If we set <strong class="bold">m</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> and <strong class="bold">c</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, we will get the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer165" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.15_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.15 –  Diagram for y = mx + c when m = 2 and c = 3"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.15 –  Diagram for y = mx + c when m = 2 and c = 3</p>
			<p>Again, the most important thing to learn from this is that the result, the value of <strong class="bold">y</strong> will always be the same if we provide the same value for <strong class="bold">x</strong>. The value we get for <strong class="bold">y</strong> will always be <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> if <strong class="bold">x</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, and always be <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> if <strong class="bold">x</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">-1</strong>.</p>
			<p>When talking about mathematical functions in terms of functional programming, it is this fact that is the crucial thing: a function with the same input will always return the same answer. In functional programming, this is known as a <em class="italic">pure function</em>.</p>
			<p>But isn't this always true for any function? Look at the following function:</p>
			<p class="source-code">function add(a, b)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    return a + b</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_function</p>
			<p>Let's call this function:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print add(2, 3)</p>
			<p>On calling the function, we will always get the following response:</p>
			<p class="source-code">5</p>
			<p>We can say that<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> this is a pure function. But what happens when we call this <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>function from the <strong class="source-inline">math</strong> module?</p>
			<p class="source-code">print Math.random()</p>
			<p class="source-code">print Math.random()</p>
			<p>Now, the output might look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">0.34</p>
			<p class="source-code">0.75</p>
			<p>Calling the random function with the same arguments (none in our case) will not give us the same answer. This is not a pure function. This is the meaning of evaluating mathematical functions in the preceding definition.</p>
			<p>Next up is the second part of the definition, <em class="italic">avoids changing the state of the program and the use of mutable data</em>. Changing the state is something we recognize from when we talked about structured programming. There, we said that <em class="italic">structured programming uses statements to change the program's state</em>. It seems like functional programming is talking about the absolute opposite of what structured programming did. We said that the state the program is in is defined by the combination of the data stored in all its variables at any given time. Changing the value of one variable will change the state of the program. </p>
			<p>What would it mean if a program avoids changing its state? Would we not be able to change any variables? The answer to this is yes, and that is what is part of the final part of the definition: that it also avoids the use of mutable data. What does mutable data mean? We'll see what this is about in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Mutable and immutable data</h2>
			<p>Mutable means liable to change, while immutable means unable to be changed. The term <em class="italic">mutable data</em> means that<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> we have data that we can change. We know that we store data in <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>variables and that we can change it as we please, as shown in the following code block:</p>
			<p class="source-code">x = 10</p>
			<p class="source-code">y = 20</p>
			<p class="source-code">x = y</p>
			<p>Here, we first assign the value <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> variable and then assign the value <strong class="source-inline">20</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> variable. On the last line, we change the value of <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> so that it's the same as <strong class="source-inline">y</strong>, which is <strong class="source-inline">20</strong>. We could say that <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is mutable as we can change it. But is this proof that <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is mutable? In some languages, it is, but in others, this is not true at all, even if the final value in <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> will always be <strong class="source-inline">20</strong>. How is it possible that <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> changes its value from <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">20</strong> if we cannot change it? This sounds impossible.</p>
			<p>The answer is in the way a language treats its variables. If we just think of a variable like a box where we can store a value and, at any time, replace it with another value, it is changeable, but if instead we treat a variable like something that is pointing out a value somewhere in the computer's memory, things will be slightly different.</p>
			<p>Let's perform a little thought experiment. We can start with the two variables, <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">y</strong>, and again assign the values <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">20</strong> to them, as we did previously:</p>
			<p class="source-code">x = 10</p>
			<p class="source-code">y = 20</p>
			<p>The following diagram illustrates what it may look like if <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> reference a memory location:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer166" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.16_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.16 – Two variables referencing two memory locations"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.16 – Two variables referencing two memory locations</p>
			<p>As we can see, the values <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">20</strong> are not stored inside the variables. Instead, the variables are pointing out where these <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>values are located in memory. What will happen if we change <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>the value <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> references from <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">20</strong>?</p>
			<p>It will look something like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer167" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.17_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.17 – Two variables that reference the same memory location"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.17 – Two variables that reference the same memory location</p>
			<p>Now, let's consider what would happen if the value at the memory location can be changed if we change one of the variables if we, for example, run this line of code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">y = 22</p>
			<p>We would then have a situation similar to the following:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer168" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.18_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.18 – Changing the value of one variable reference"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.18 – Changing the value of one variable reference</p>
			<p>Now, let's print the value of the <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> reference, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print x</p>
			<p>We would get the following result:</p>
			<p class="source-code">22</p>
			<p>Even if we never assigned <strong class="source-inline">22</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">x</strong>, it would have that value as we allowed <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> to change the content of the memory location of both references.</p>
			<p>If we instead make the <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>memory location immutable, what <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>would happen when we assign <strong class="source-inline">22</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">y</strong>? We would get something like the following:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer169" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.19_B15554.jpg" alt="Figure 10.19 – Assigning a new value to an immutable variable"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.19 – Assigning a new value to an immutable variable</p>
			<p>As we can see, the value did not change at all. Instead, <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> is now referencing a new memory location. If <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> was redeclared, we would get a new fresh variable with the same name as the old <strong class="source-inline">y</strong> variable.</p>
			<p>This is how immutability works. The<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> variables are not changed. Instead, a new<a id="_idIndexMarker649"/> value is created in another location in memory. As we cannot change any variables, we can't change the state of the program either.</p>
			<p>But why is it important that our variables are immutable and that we can't change the state of the program? The answer is called side effects.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Avoiding side effects</h2>
			<p>A side effect<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> in computer programming is when an expression modifies some values in the variables that are outside its local environment. To understand this, let's look at an example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">x = 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">function some_func(value)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    x = x + value</p>
			<p class="source-code">    return x + 3</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_function</p>
			<p>First, this program is very naïve, but it illustrates the point we need to make. Here, we have a variable, <strong class="source-inline">x</strong>, and a function called <strong class="source-inline">some_func</strong>. The variable is declared outside of the function but is modified inside it. We can now use the following expression:</p>
			<p class="source-code"> x = x + value</p>
			<p>This is modifying a value outside its environment, and the body of the function is the environment that expression lives in.</p>
			<p>This is true if the language we are using has defined <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> as mutable so that we can change it. But in a language where <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> is immutable, there would be no change. Instead, we would get a new <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> variable that only exists inside of the function.</p>
			<p>What would the disadvantage be if we did this in a language where <strong class="source-inline">x</strong> was mutable? To see this, we can call the function twice and print its result, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print some_func(10)</p>
			<p class="source-code">print some_func(10)</p>
			<p>The output will look as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">13</p>
			<p class="source-code">23</p>
			<p>This is not a good behavior as calling the function with the same arguments should always return the same value. Here, it does not, and the reason this happens is because the program has side effects. This is because the result the function returns is dependent on what happened in previous calls to the function. </p>
			<p>If we have a <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>program that has no side effects, it will be very predictable what will happen when the program runs. If we think about the previous small program, we saw that it will be almost impossible for us to predict what a call to the function will result in as the result will depend on previous calls, as well as what data we provided as arguments in these calls.</p>
			<p>The next principle of functional programming is called declarative programming. Let's see what it's all about.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Declarative programming</h2>
			<p>To understand what declarative programming<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> is, we can compare it to something we know, and that is imperative programming. In imperative programming, we focus on describing how something will be done. In declarative programming, on the other hand, the focus is on what we want to achieve.</p>
			<p>To understand this, we will look at some real-world examples. If you go to a restaurant, you can either be an imperative or declarative guest.</p>
			<p>The imperative guest would make an order like this:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">"I would like the cod, please. First, bake it in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. In the end, check it regularly so it won't overcook. While the cod is in the oven, please boil the potatoes. To prepare the cream sauce, first, melt some butter in a medium-sized pan over medium heat. Slowly add corn starch and stir for about a minute. While constantly whisking, slowly add whipping cream and milk. Finally, add some parmesan cheese. Let the sauce reduce on a low heat while you whisk occasionally."</em></p>
			<p>If, on the other hand, you are a declarative restaurant guest, you would say something like this:</p>
			<p><em class="italic">"I would like the cod, please."</em></p>
			<p>The first guest answers the question of how, while the second one focuses on what.</p>
			<p>An excellent example of something <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>declarative in computer science is <strong class="bold">SQL</strong>. It is an abbreviation of <strong class="bold">Structured Query Language</strong> and is used to store and retrieve data from databases. If we want to get the first and last name of all the customers stored in the customer's table, we could write the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">SELECT firstName, lastName FROM customers;</p>
			<p>This is declarative as we say what <a id="_idIndexMarker654"/>we want – the first and last names of the customers – but we say nothing about how the data will be retrieved. Somewhere in the underlying database system, some parts must know how this will be done, but if we are using SQL, we don't need to understand how this is done.</p>
			<p>Python is a programming language where we can write both imperative and declarative programs. Let's look at two programs that perform the same thing, one in an imperative way and one in a declarative way.</p>
			<p>First is a short program that has been written in an imperative style:</p>
			<p class="source-code">strings = ['06', '68', '00', '30']</p>
			<p class="source-code">numbers = []</p>
			<p class="source-code">for value in strings:</p>
			<p class="source-code">    if int(value) != 0:</p>
			<p class="source-code">        numbers.append(int(value))</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(numbers)</p>
			<p>From the preceding code, we can observe the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">On the first line, we define a list of strings. Each string contains a two-digit number. Values below 10 will be prefixed with a 0.</li>
				<li>On the second line, we declare an empty list. We will convert the numbers in the first list from strings into integer values and store them in this array.</li>
				<li>We will then enter a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. In each iteration of this loop, a value from the first list will be assigned to the <strong class="source-inline">value</strong> variable. The first time it will be <strong class="source-inline">06</strong>, the second time it will be <strong class="source-inline">68</strong>, and so on.</li>
				<li>We then have an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement. It will convert the value into an integer and compare it to zero. If that is false – that is, it is anything but zero – we will enter the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> block.</li>
				<li>Inside this block, we will append the value we converted into an integer to the list numbers. </li>
				<li>When we have gone through all the values in the first list, we print the contents of the second list and get the following output:<p class="source-code">[6, 68, 30]</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, the zero prefixes we had<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> for the first value are now gone as these are integers, and 06 is just 6. Also, the value that had a double zero is not in the list at all as it made the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement false, and the line where we appended the value was skipped in that iteration.</p>
			<p>The second version of this program is written in a declarative style and looks as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">strings = ['06', '68', '00', '30']</p>
			<p class="source-code">numbers = [int(value) for value in strings if int(value) != 0]</p>
			<p class="source-code">print(numbers)</p>
			<p>This program does the same thing as the previous one, but the way it is written is very different. It uses <a id="_idIndexMarker656"/>something called a <em class="italic">list comprehension</em>. It is the part after <strong class="source-inline">numbers =</strong>. If you look closely, you can see a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop in the middle of this expression. It looks just like the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop in the other example. Following this loop, we can see an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong>, and it looks just like the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement in the first program. An <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> at this location in a comprehension serves as a filter. If this is evaluated as true, the current value will be passed to the front of this expression. Here, we convert the value into an integer. This converted value will be part of a list called <strong class="source-inline">numbers</strong>.</p>
			<p>This is declarative because we don't say how this value will get into the new list, we just say what will go into the list.</p>
			<p>The final principle used by functional programming that we will cover is called first-class functions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-159"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>First-class functions</h2>
			<p>Functional programming uses <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>the principle of<a id="_idIndexMarker658"/> first-class functions. A function is said to be first-class if it is treated as a first-class citizen of the programming language in question. A first-class citizen is something that we can modify, pass as an argument to a function, return from a function, and so on.</p>
			<p>In a programming language that supports first-class functions, we can do things such as the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">function formal_greeter(name)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    return "Dear, " + name</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">function informal_greeter(name)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    return "Yo, " + name</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">function greeter(greeter_func, name)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    greeter_func(name)</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">greeter(formal_greeter, "Bob")</p>
			<p class="source-code">greeter(informal_greeter, "Bob")</p>
			<p>This program declares two functions, <strong class="source-inline">formal_greeter</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">informal_greeter</strong>. Both accept a <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> as its argument and will return a greeting with the name appended.</p>
			<p>We then have a function called <strong class="source-inline">greeter</strong>. This function accepts a reference to a function as its first argument and a name as its second. The two last lines in the program are calling the <strong class="source-inline">greeter</strong> function. The first one is passing a reference to the formal greeter function, while the second is passing one to the informal greeter.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">greeter</strong> function will use the function passed to it, so the two calls will result in the following output:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Dear, Bob</p>
			<p class="source-code">Yo, Bob</p>
			<p>Being able to work with<a id="_idIndexMarker659"/> functions like this has several benefits. Let's look at an example. Earlier in this chapter, we talked about object-oriented programming, and we defined a class called <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong>. We saw that we could create several objects from this class, each one representing one person. </p>
			<p>Later in this chapter, we will see that <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>programming languages can use more than one paradigm, and if we use one that lets us define classes and use functions as first-class citizens, we can do something very useful.</p>
			<p>If we create a couple of person objects with <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> and insert them into a list structure, this might look something like the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">p1 = Person("Dipika", 34)</p>
			<p class="source-code">p2 = Person("Manfred", 58)</p>
			<p class="source-code">p3 = Person("Ahmed", 38)</p>
			<p class="source-code">p4 = Person("Rita", 39)</p>
			<p class="source-code">persons = [p1, p2, p3, p4]</p>
			<p>We now have four person objects stored in a list called <strong class="source-inline">persons</strong>. If we want to sort the list, we can use a sorting function provided by the language. But there is a problem. The sorting function will not know what we want to sort on; that is, <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>. It does not even know anything about <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> objects as they are defined by a class that we have written. What it knows is how to sort a list, but it needs the help of a function that can receive two objects from the <strong class="source-inline">Person</strong> class, and which returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> if the first object is larger than the second and <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> if it is not. We will need to write that function and, in it, define what makes one object larger than the other one. We can decide if it should be <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>.</p>
			<p>If we want to sort the objects by their <strong class="source-inline">age</strong>, we could do the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">function compare(person1, person2)</p>
			<p class="source-code">    return person1.get_age() &gt; person2.get_age()</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_function</p>
			<p class="source-code">sorted_persons = sort(compare, persons)</p>
			<p>Here, we have a function called <strong class="source-inline">compare</strong>. It will accept two <strong class="source-inline">person</strong> objects as its arguments. If the age of the first<a id="_idIndexMarker661"/> person is greater than the age of the<a id="_idIndexMarker662"/> second person, this function will return <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. Otherwise, it returns <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">sort</strong> function accepts as its first argument a reference to this function. When it is performing the sort, it will need to compare two different objects to determine in what order it should place them in the sorted list. </p>
			<p>In our example, it will first pass <strong class="source-inline">Dipika</strong>, who is <strong class="source-inline">34</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Manfred</strong>, who is <strong class="source-inline">58</strong>, to the function. The <strong class="source-inline">compare</strong> function will return <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> since the age of <strong class="source-inline">Manfred</strong> is greater than the age of <strong class="source-inline">Dipika</strong>. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">sort</strong> function will now take the winner from the last round, <strong class="source-inline">Manfred</strong>, and pass this object along with Ahmed's object. This time, <strong class="source-inline">Manfred</strong> will be passed first, so he will be the <strong class="source-inline">person1</strong> object in the function, while <strong class="source-inline">Ahmed</strong> will be <strong class="source-inline">person2</strong>. </p>
			<p>This time, the first object has an age that is greater than the second one, so the function returns <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>.</p>
			<p>This is how the <strong class="source-inline">sort</strong> function can use a function that we provide to fulfill its task to sort the list. If we want to sort on the names instead, we will only need to change the <strong class="source-inline">compare</strong> function so that it compares the names instead of the ages.</p>
			<p>If we print the <strong class="source-inline">sorted_persons</strong> list, which contains the sorted list, we will get this result if we sort on age:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Dipika, 34</p>
			<p class="source-code">Ahmed, 38</p>
			<p class="source-code">Rita, 39</p>
			<p class="source-code">Manfred, 58</p>
			<p>If, instead, we sort on the names, we will get the following result:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Ahmed, 38</p>
			<p class="source-code">Dipika, 34</p>
			<p class="source-code">Manfred, 58</p>
			<p class="source-code">Rita, 39</p>
			<p>First-class functions are a compelling feature that let us write functions that are more general-purpose as we can pass another function that will do parts of its job, just as the sort function works.</p>
			<p>Functional programming has several <a id="_idIndexMarker663"/>concepts that are both powerful and let us <a id="_idIndexMarker664"/>write higher quality code. That is the reason why functional programming is constantly gaining popularity and why many non-functional programming languages are borrowing functional concepts.</p>
			<p>The following is a list of some popular languages that support functional programming, either as its primary paradigm or are using many concepts from functional programming:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C++ (since C++ 11)</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Clojure</li>
				<li>Common Lisp</li>
				<li>Erlang</li>
				<li>F#</li>
				<li>Haskell</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>Python </li>
				<li>Ruby</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Functional programming is not only a very interesting paradigm, but it is also influencing many established languages to incorporate functional concepts. The next paradigm is not as widely used as the ones we have looked at so far, but it has some interesting concepts.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>Understanding logic programming</h1>
			<p>This paradigm is<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> based on formal logic. A program written in a language that implements this paradigm is constructed of a set of sentences in a logical form that will express facts and rules about a specific problem domain.</p>
			<p>This might sound complicated and strange, but as we will see, the basic concepts of this paradigm are rather simple. Consider the following diagram:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer170" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Fig_10.20_B15554.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.20 – A family tree</p>
			<p>In the preceding diagram, we can see a <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>family tree. Looking at it, we can see the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Anna and Bob have a child, Lisa.</li>
				<li>Lisa and Fred have a child, Karen.</li>
				<li>Fred and Sue have a child, John.</li>
				<li>Karen's grandparents are Anna and Bob.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In a programming language that uses logic programming, we can define this family tree using something<a id="_idIndexMarker667"/> called <em class="italic">predicates</em>. This will look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">mother(anna,lisa).</p>
			<p class="source-code">mother(lisa,karen).</p>
			<p class="source-code">mother(sue,john).</p>
			<p class="source-code">father(bob,lisa).</p>
			<p class="source-code">father(fred,karen).</p>
			<p class="source-code">father(fred,john).</p>
			<p>They might seem to come in an odd order, but most logic languages want us to group all predicates of the same kind together so, in this case, we first define all the mothers and, after that, all the fathers. </p>
			<p>On the first line, we can see that <strong class="source-inline">Anna</strong> is the mother of Lisa, while on the fourth line, we can see that <strong class="source-inline">Bob</strong> is the father of <strong class="source-inline">Lisa</strong>. The names are called <em class="italic">atoms</em> because <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>they represent a single value, and atoms need to be defined by lowercase letters only.</p>
			<p>We can now define some <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>rules that dictate what makes someone a parent and grandparent. It might look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">grandparent(X,Z) :- parent(X,Y), parent(Y,Z).</p>
			<p class="source-code">parent(X,Y) :- father(X,Y).</p>
			<p class="source-code">parent(X,Y) :- mother(X,Y).</p>
			<p>Here, <strong class="source-inline">X</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">Y</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">Z</strong> are variables. Variables are defined with an initial capital letter. We can read this as</p>
			<p><em class="italic">For any X, Y, Z,</em></p>
			<p>	If X is a parent of Y, and Y is a parent of Z</p>
			<p>	Then X is the grandparent of Z</p>
			<p>The two last rows define what a parent is. It is either if <strong class="source-inline">X</strong> is the father of <strong class="source-inline">Y</strong> or if <strong class="source-inline">X</strong> is the mother of <strong class="source-inline">Y</strong>.</p>
			<p>We can now use this to ask questions like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">grandparent(anna, karen).</p>
			<p>This question will produce the following answer:</p>
			<p class="source-code">yes</p>
			<p>This is true as <strong class="source-inline">Anna</strong> is the grandmother of <strong class="source-inline">Karen</strong>.</p>
			<p>We can also ask who Karen's grandparents are, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">grandparent(Q, karen).</p>
			<p>Here, <strong class="source-inline">Q</strong> is a variable, and we will get the following response:</p>
			<p class="source-code">bob</p>
			<p class="source-code">anna</p>
			<p>We could also ask who the grandchild of Anna is:</p>
			<p class="source-code">grandparent(anna, Q).</p>
			<p>This will tell us that it is <strong class="source-inline">Karen</strong>:</p>
			<p class="source-code">karen</p>
			<p>There are, of course, more things that you can do in a logic programming language, but this was a little taste of what logic programming can look like.</p>
			<p>The following is a list of some<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> languages that support logic programming:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ALF</li>
				<li>Curry</li>
				<li>Fril</li>
				<li>Janus</li>
				<li>Prolog</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The way we structure the code in logic programming is very different from all other paradigms, making it an interesting <em class="italic">outsider</em>.</p>
			<p>We have now looked at the leading players in the paradigm field. But before we leave these paradigms behind, let's just mention a few more to get a more complete picture.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Other paradigms</h1>
			<p>The paradigms we have covered so far in this chapter are the most commonly used, but there are several others. Let's have a quick look at some of them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Function-level</h2>
			<p>In function-level programming, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>no variables at all. Instead, programs are built from elementary functions, combined with function-to-function operations, sometimes referred to <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>as <em class="italic">functionals</em> or <em class="italic">functional forms</em>.</p>
			<p>Languages that implement this paradigm are built around the following hierarchy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Atoms are the data that the functions operate on. They will only appear as input or output to the programs and will never be found inside the actual program.</li>
				<li>Functions will convert <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>atoms into other atoms. The programming language will define a set of functions, and the programmer can create new ones using functional forms. The program itself is also a function.</li>
				<li>Functional forms are used to convert functions into other functions. They can be used by the programmer to create new forms.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Array programming</h2>
			<p>In array programming, operations <a id="_idIndexMarker674"/>will be performed on an entire set of values at once. These solutions are commonly used for scientific and engineering applications.</p>
			<p>Operations are generalized to apply to both scalars and arrays. In this book, we have encountered scalars in the form of variables that can only hold one single value at a time. We have also looked at arrays. If you need a refresh your memory on variables and arrays, you can read more about them in <a href="B15554_06_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor091"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Data – Variables</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em class="italic">a + b</em> operation will act differently if <em class="italic">a</em> and <em class="italic">b</em> are scalars and if they are arrays. If they are scalars, the result will be the sum of adding the two values. If they are arrays, the result will be the sum of all values stored in the two arrays.</p>
			<p>Array programming can simplify programming at the cost of efficiency. This means that it can be easier to use these kinds of languages when we write the code but running them might take a longer time than if the program is written in a language that uses another paradigm.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Quantum programming</h2>
			<p>This is the paradigm of the<a id="_idIndexMarker675"/> future. To be able to use this paradigm, we will need quantum computers. A quantum computer uses the quantum-mechanical properties particles defined in quantum physics. These particles have a superposition, meaning that before we observe them, they will be in any possible position. A quantum computer will use this by defining something known as a <em class="italic">qubit</em>. A normal computer has bits that can either be 0 or 1. A qubit will be both, and using this property, a quantum computer will be able to calculate all possible results of any given input in a fraction of the time it takes to perform the same calculations with the kind of computers we are using today. </p>
			<p>Quantum programming is not a <a id="_idIndexMarker676"/>paradigm per se, but to be able to write programs for quantum computers, we will need languages that will support other kinds of operations than the ones we are using today:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.21 – Part of a quantum computer built at IBM Research in Zurich. Photo by IBM Zurich Lab, cc-by-2.0.</p>
			<p>Even though we are just seeing the first quantum computers slowly take form, several languages that we can use for them are already defined. They are built upon already existing paradigms, such as imperative and functional programming. When we have fully functional and accessible quantum computers, we will see an explosion of new languages that will utilize the powers of these computers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>Multi-paradigm languages</h1>
			<p>Most programming languages will not stick to just one paradigm but instead use several. This is why they are<a id="_idIndexMarker677"/> called <em class="italic">multi-paradigm languages</em>. We can make a table of some of the most popular languages to see what paradigms they support:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer172" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15554_Table_10.1.jpg" alt="Table 10.1"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Table 10.1</p>
			<p>It can always be argued how much a <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>paradigm influences a programming language. Here, I have looked at the main paradigms we have looked at in this chapter and how the documentation of the languages describes themselves.</p>
			<p>A language that is marked with <em class="italic">Some</em> has implemented some concepts of this paradigm. A language that has a <em class="italic">Yes</em> in the column for a paradigm might not have this paradigm as its main one but has implemented many of its features.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at some of the most popular programming paradigms.</p>
			<p>The first two that we looked at, structured and object-oriented programming, are the two paradigms that have dominated programming over the last 35-40 years.</p>
			<p>In structured programming, the program state is modified using statements, and the flow of the program is controlled using loops and selections, such as if statements.</p>
			<p>Object-oriented programming builds upon the ideas of structured programming, but the code is organized using concepts known to us humans, such as classifying things that have similar data and behavior. This is described in classes that act as blueprints for objects that represent real-world things, such as people or bank accounts.</p>
			<p>Functional programming is the oldest of the paradigms we covered in this book but has gained popularity in the last decade. In functional programming, we don't want to modify the state of the program and are using the concept of pure functions to achieve this. Writing programs using this paradigm can reduce errors in the code and make our applications more stable.</p>
			<p>In logical programming, we define predicates that will define rules that we can use to answer logical questions. Compared to the other three paradigms, local programming is far less popular.</p>
			<p>There are many other paradigms available, and they are often rather specialized or used by a few obscure languages.</p>
			<p>Most programming languages are multi-paradigm in that they use concepts from more than one paradigm.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will see that our work, as programmers, is not done when the code is written. </p>

    in order to help you help your program to make decisions. So far, though, you
    have not yet learned what to do with data. We have not created nor stored data.
    Yet, we know that video games store data! Video games sometimes store the names
    of players as well as the highest score that a player has achieved. How does one
    computer program remember all of this information? In this chapter, you will learn
    about some ways that Python can store and retrieve data, such as lists and dictionaries.

    tool to use so that you can type your lists and dictionaries and then check the
    outcome of your coding. Otherwise, once your prompt is available, you can type
    lists and dictionaries, your shell will remember the information that you enter,
    and then you can test how to retrieve, add, and remove information.

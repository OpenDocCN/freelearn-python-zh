- en: This is a book about software construction with Python. Good software is built
    from a good design. By saying things such as clean code, you may be thinking that
    we will explore good practices that relate only to the implementation details
    of the software, instead of its design. However, this assumption would be wrong
    since the code is not something different from the design—the code *is* the design.

  zh: 这是一本关于使用Python进行软件构建的书。优秀的软件是由良好的设计构建的。通过说诸如“干净代码”之类的话，你可能认为我们将探讨仅与软件实现细节相关的良好实践，而不是其设计。然而，这种假设是错误的，因为代码并不是与设计不同的东西——代码*就是*设计。
- en: The code is probably the most detailed representation of the design. In the
    first two chapters, we discussed why structuring the code in a consistent way
    was important, and we have seen idioms for writing more compact and idiomatic
    code. Now it's time to understand that clean code is that, and much more—the ultimate
    goal is to make the code as robust as possible, and to write it in a way that
    minimizes defects or makes them utterly evident, should they occur.

  zh: 我们正在开发的软件的一些部分并不是直接由用户调用的，而是由代码的其他部分调用。当我们将应用程序的责任划分为不同的组件或层时，这种情况就会发生，我们必须考虑它们之间的交互。
- en: We have to encapsulate some functionality behind each component and expose an
    interface to clients who are going to use that functionality, namely, an **Application
    Programming Interface** (**API**). The functions, classes, or methods we write
    for that component have a particular way of working under certain considerations
    that, if they are not met, will make our code crash. Conversely, clients calling
    that code expect a particular response, and any failure of our function to provide
    this would represent a defect.
  id: totrans-15

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我们必须在每个组件后面封装一些功能，并向将使用该功能的客户端公开接口，即**应用程序编程接口**（**API**）。我们为该组件编写的函数、类或方法在特定考虑下有特定的工作方式，如果这些考虑不满足，将使我们的代码崩溃。相反，调用该代码的客户端期望得到特定的响应，而我们函数未能提供这种响应的任何失败都代表了一个缺陷。
- en: That is to say that if, for example, we have a function that is expected to
    work with a series of parameters of type integers, and some other function invokes
    ours by passing strings, it is clear that it should not work as expected, but
    in reality, the function should not run at all because it was called incorrectly
    (the client made a mistake). This error should not pass silently.

  zh: 换句话说，如果我们有一个期望与一系列整数类型的参数一起工作的函数，而另一个函数通过传递字符串来调用我们的函数，那么很明显，它不应该按预期工作，但事实上，该函数根本不应该运行，因为它被错误地调用了（客户端犯了错误）。这种错误不应该无声地通过。
- en: Of course, when designing an API, the expected input, output, and side effects
    should be documented. But documentation cannot enforce the behavior of the software
    at runtime. These rules, what every part of the code expects in order to work
    properly and what the caller is expecting from them, should be part of the design,
    and here is where the concept of a **contract** comes into place.
  id: totrans-17

  zh: 当然，在设计API时，应该记录预期的输入、输出和副作用。但文档不能强制软件在运行时的行为。这些规则，即代码的每个部分为了正常工作所期望的内容以及调用者从它们期望得到的内容，应该是设计的一部分，这就是**合同**概念发挥作用的地方。
- en: The idea behind the DbC approach is that, instead of implicitly placing in the
    code what every party is expecting, both parties agree on a contract that, if
    violated, will raise an exception, clearly stating why it cannot continue.

  zh: 在我们的上下文中，合同是一种强制执行某些规则的结构，这些规则必须在软件组件的通信过程中得到遵守。合同主要涉及先决条件和后置条件，但在某些情况下，也会描述不变性和副作用：
- en: '**Preconditions**: We can say that these are all the checks the code will perform
    before running. It will check for all the conditions that have to be made before
    the function can proceed. In general, it''s implemented by validating the dataset
    provided in the parameters passed, but nothing should stop us from running all
    sorts of validations (for example, validating a set in a database, a file, or
    another method that was called before) if we consider that their side effects
    are overshadowed by the importance of such validations. Note that this imposes

  zh: '**先决条件**：我们可以将这些检查称为代码在运行之前将执行的所有检查。它将检查在函数可以继续之前必须满足的所有条件。通常，这是通过验证在参数中提供的数据集来实现的，但如果我们认为这些验证的副作用被这种验证的重要性所掩盖，那么我们不应该停止运行各种验证（例如，验证数据库中的集合、文件或之前调用的其他方法）。请注意，这会对调用者施加约束。'
- en: '**Postconditions**: The opposite of preconditions, here, the validations are
    done after the function call is returned. Postcondition validations are run to validate
    what the caller is expecting from this component.'
  id: totrans-21

  zh: '**后置条件**：与先决条件相反，在这里，验证是在函数调用返回后进行的。后置条件验证是运行以验证调用者从这个组件期望得到的内容。'

    of a function, the invariants, the things that are kept constant while the code
    of the function is running, as an expression of the logic of the function to be

  id: totrans-24

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 虽然从概念上讲，所有这些项目都是软件组件合同的一部分，这也是应该写入此类组件文档的内容，但只有前两个（预设条件和后置条件）需要在低级别（代码）强制执行。
- en: The reason why we would design by contract is that if errors occur, they must
    be easy to spot (and by noticing whether it was either the precondition or postcondition
    that failed, we will find the culprit much more easily) so that they can be quickly
    corrected. More importantly, we want critical parts of the code to avoid being
    executed under the wrong assumptions. This should help to clearly mark the limits
    for the responsibilities and errors if they occur, as opposed to something saying
    that this part of the application is failing. But the caller code provided the
    wrong arguments, so where should we apply the fix?
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我们之所以会按合同设计，是因为如果出现错误，它们必须容易发现（通过注意到是预设条件还是后置条件失败，我们将更容易找到罪魁祸首），以便它们可以迅速纠正。更重要的是，我们希望代码的关键部分避免在错误假设下执行。这应该有助于清楚地标记责任和错误的界限，如果发生错误，而不是说这个应用程序的部分失败了。但是，调用代码提供了错误的参数，那么我们应该在哪里应用修复？
- en: The idea is that preconditions bind the client (they have an obligation to meet
    them if they want to run some part of the code), whereas postconditions bind the
    component in relation to some guarantees that the client can verify and enforce.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 理念是，预设条件将客户端（如果它们想要运行代码的某些部分，就有义务满足它们），而后置条件将组件与客户端可以验证和执行的某些保证联系起来。
- en: This way, we can quickly identify responsibilities. If the precondition fails,
    we know it is due to a defect on the client. On the other hand, if the postcondition
    check fails, we know the problem is in the routine or class (supplier) itself.
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这样，我们就可以快速识别责任。如果预设条件失败，我们知道这是由于客户端的缺陷造成的。另一方面，如果后置条件检查失败，我们知道问题在于程序或类（供应商）本身。
- en: Specifically, regarding preconditions, it is important to highlight that they
    can be checked at runtime, and if they occur, the code that is being called should
    not be run at all (it does not make sense to run it because its conditions do
    not hold, and doing so might end up making things worse).
  id: totrans-28

  zh: 具体来说，关于预设条件，重要的是要强调它们可以在运行时进行检查，如果它们发生，被调用的代码根本不应该运行（因为它的条件不成立，这样做可能会使事情变得更糟）。

  zh: 预设条件
- en: Preconditions are all of the guarantees a function or method expects to receive
    in order to work correctly. In general programming terms, this usually means providing
    data that is properly formed, for example, objects that are initialized, non-null
    values, and many more. For Python, in particular, being dynamically typed, this
    also means that sometimes we need to check for the exact type of data that is
    provided. This is not exactly the same as type checking, the `mypy` kind would
    do this, but rather verify the exact values that are needed.
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 预设条件是函数或方法为了正确工作而期望接收的所有保证。在一般编程术语中，这通常意味着提供正确形成的数据，例如，初始化的对象、非空值等等。对于Python来说，特别是动态类型，这也意味着有时我们需要检查提供的数据的确切类型。这并不完全等同于类型检查，`mypy`这样的工具会做这种检查，而是验证所需的精确值。
- en: Part of these checks can be detected early on by using static analysis tools,
    such as `mypy`, which we already introduced in *Chapter 1*, *Introduction, Code
    Formatting, and Tools*, but these checks are not enough. A function should have
    proper validation for the information that it is going to handle.
  id: totrans-31
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这些检查的一部分可以通过使用静态分析工具（如`mypy`）在早期检测到，我们在*第一章*，*介绍、代码格式化和工具*中已经介绍了它，但这些检查是不够的。一个函数应该对其将要处理的信息进行适当的验证。
- en: Now, this poses the question of where to place the validation logic, depending
    on whether we let the clients validate all the data before calling the function,
    or allow this one to validate everything that it received prior to running its
    own logic. The former equates to a tolerant approach (because the function itself
    is still allowing any data, potentially malformed data as well), whereas the latter
    equates to a demanding approach.
  id: totrans-32
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 现在，这提出了一个问题，即验证逻辑应该放在哪里，这取决于我们是否让客户端在调用函数之前验证所有数据，或者允许它在运行自己的逻辑之前验证它所接收到的所有内容。前者等同于宽容的方法（因为函数本身仍然允许任何数据，包括潜在的不规范数据），而后者等同于严格的方法。
- en: For the purposes of this analysis, we prefer a demanding approach when it comes
    to DbC because it is usually the safest choice in terms of robustness, and usually
    the most common practice in the industry.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在本次分析中，我们倾向于对 DbC 采用严格的方法，因为它在稳健性方面通常是最佳选择，并且在行业中通常是最常见的实践。
- en: Regardless of the approach we decide to take, we should always keep in mind
    the non-redundancy principle, which states that the enforcement of each precondition
    for a function should be done by only one of the two parts of the contract, but
    not both. This means that we put the validation logic on the client, or we leave
    it to the function itself, but in no case should we duplicate it (which also relates
    to the DRY principle, which we will discuss later on in this chapter).
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 无论我们决定采取哪种方法，我们都应该始终牢记非冗余原则，该原则指出，对于函数的每个先决条件的执行，应由合同的任一部分而不是两部分来完成。这意味着我们将验证逻辑放在客户端，或者将其留给函数本身，但在任何情况下都不应该重复它（这也与DRY原则相关，我们将在本章后面讨论）。

- en: Probably the best way to enforce this is by adding control mechanisms to our
    methods, functions, and classes, and if they fail, raise a `RuntimeError` exception
    or `ValueError`. It's hard to devise a general rule for the correct type of exception,
    as that would pretty much depend on the application in particular. These previously
    mentioned exceptions are the most common types of exception, but if they don't
    fit accurately with the problem, creating a custom exception would be the best
    choice.

  zh: 可能最好的强制执行方式是在我们的方法、函数和类中添加控制机制，如果它们失败，则抛出 `RuntimeError` 异常或 `ValueError`。很难制定一个关于正确异常类型的通用规则，因为这很大程度上取决于特定的应用程序。前面提到的异常是最常见的异常类型，但如果它们与问题不精确匹配，创建一个自定义异常将是最佳选择。
- en: We would also like to keep the code as isolated as possible. That is, the code
    for the preconditions in one part, the one for the postconditions in another,

  zh: 这种设计原则的主要价值是有效地识别问题所在。通过定义合同，当运行时出现问题时，将清楚地知道是代码的哪个部分出了问题，以及是什么破坏了合同。
- en: As a result of following this principle, the code will be more robust. Each
    component is enforcing its own constraints and maintaining some invariants, and
    the program can be proven correct as long as these invariants are preserved.
  id: totrans-45
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 遵循这一原则的结果是代码将更加稳健。每个组件都在执行自己的约束并保持一些不变性，只要这些不变性得到保持，程序就可以被证明是正确的。
- en: It also serves the purpose of clarifying the structure of the program better.
    Instead of trying to run ad hoc validations, or trying to surmount all possible
    failure scenarios, the contracts explicitly specify what each function or method
    expects to work properly, and what is expected from them.
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 它还起到了更好地阐明程序结构的作用。而不是尝试运行临时的验证，或者尝试克服所有可能的失败场景，合约明确指定了每个函数或方法期望正常工作的内容，以及期望从它们那里得到的内容。
- en: Of course, following these principles also adds extra work, because we are not
    just programming the core logic of our main application, but also the contracts.
    In addition, we might want to consider adding unit tests for these contracts as
    well. However, the quality gained by this approach pays off in the long run; hence,
    it is a good idea to implement this principle for critical components of the application.
  id: totrans-47
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 当然，遵循这些原则也会增加额外的工作，因为我们不仅正在编写主应用程序的核心逻辑，还在编写合约。此外，我们可能还想考虑为这些合约添加单元测试。然而，这种方法获得的质量在长期来看是值得的；因此，为应用程序的关键组件实现这一原则是一个好主意。
- en: Nonetheless, for this method to be effective, we should carefully think about
    what we are willing to validate, and this has to be a meaningful value. For example,
    it would not make much sense to define contracts that only check for the correct
    data types of the parameters provided to a function. Many programmers would argue
    that this would be like trying to make Python a statically typed language. Regardless
    of this, tools such as `mypy`, in combination with the use of annotations, would
    serve this purpose much better and with less effort. With that in mind, design
    contracts so that there is actually value in them, checking, for example, the
    properties of the objects being passed and returned, the conditions they have
    to abide by, and so on.

  zh: 然而，为了使这种方法有效，我们应该仔细思考我们愿意验证的内容，这必须是一个有意义的值。例如，定义仅检查传递给函数的参数的正确数据类型的合约并没有太多意义。许多程序员会认为这就像试图将Python变成一种静态类型语言。不管怎样，结合使用注解的工具，如`mypy`，将更好地实现这一目的，并且更加省力。考虑到这一点，设计合约，以便它们确实具有价值，例如检查传递和返回的对象的性质，它们必须遵守的条件，等等。

    logging is a complementary practice (and a good one; we should always log errors),

- en: In some scenarios, when there is an error and there is a risk of the software
    producing an incorrect value or failing entirely, we might be able to replace
    the result with another, safer value. We call this value substitution, since we
    are, in fact, replacing the actual erroneous result for a value that is to be
    considered non-disruptive (it could be a default, a well-known constant, a sentinel
    value, or simply something that does not affect the result at all, such as returning
    zero in a case where the result is intended to be applied to a sum).

  zh: 在某些场景中，当出现错误并且有软件产生不正确值或完全失败的风险时，我们可能能够用另一个更安全的值替换结果。我们称之为值替换，因为我们实际上是在用要考虑为非破坏性的值（它可能是一个默认值、一个已知的常量、一个哨兵值，或者简单地是根本不影响结果的东西，例如在结果打算应用于求和的情况下返回零）来替换实际错误的结果。
- en: Value substitution is not always possible, however. This strategy has to be
    carefully chosen for cases where the substituted value is a safe option. Making
    this decision is a trade-off between robustness and correctness. A software program
    is robust when it does not fail, even in the presence of an erroneous scenario.
    But this is not correct either.

  zh: 值替换并不总是可行的。然而，对于替换的值是安全选项的情况，这种策略必须谨慎选择。做出这个决定是在鲁棒性和正确性之间进行权衡。一个软件程序在存在错误场景的情况下不会失败，这就是它的鲁棒性。但这也不完全正确。
- en: This might not be acceptable for some kinds of software. If the application
    is critical, or the data being handled is too sensitive, this is not an option,
    since we cannot afford to provide users (or other parts of the application) with
    erroneous results. In these cases, we opt for correctness, rather than let the
    program explode when yielding the wrong results.

  zh: 对于某些类型的软件，这可能是不被接受的。如果应用程序是关键的，或者处理的数据过于敏感，这不是一个选择，因为我们无法承担向用户提供（或应用程序的其他部分）错误结果的风险。在这些情况下，我们选择正确性，而不是让程序在产生错误结果时崩溃。
- en: A slightly different, and safer, version of this decision is to use default
    values for data that is not provided. This can be the case for parts of the code
    that can work with a default behavior, for example, default values for environment
    variables that are not set, for missing entries in configuration files, or for
    parameters of functions.

    one of these external components, and not in our function itself. If that is the
    case, our function should communicate this properly. This will make it easier

- en: If the code tries to use exceptions to handle expected scenarios or business
    logic, the flow of the program will become harder to read. This will lead to a
    situation where exceptions are used as a sort of `go-to` statement, which (to
    make things worse) could span multiple levels on the call stack (up to caller
    functions), violating the encapsulation of the logic into its correct level of
    abstraction. The case could get even worse if these `except` blocks are mixing
    business logic with truly exceptional cases that the code is trying to defend
    against; in that case, it will be harder to distinguish between the core logic
    we have to maintain and the errors to be handled.
  id: totrans-78
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 如果代码试图使用异常来处理预期的场景或业务逻辑，程序的流程将变得难以阅读。这会导致异常被用作一种“跳转”语句，这（更糟糕的是）可能会跨越调用栈的多个级别（直到调用函数），违反了逻辑封装到正确抽象级别的原则。如果这些`except`块将业务逻辑与代码试图防御的真正异常情况混合在一起，情况可能会变得更糟；在这种情况下，将难以区分我们必须维护的核心逻辑和要处理的问题。

  zh: 不要将异常作为业务逻辑的“万能”机制。当代码出现调用者需要了解的问题时，才抛出异常。
- en: This last concept is an important one; exceptions are usually about notifying
    the caller about something amiss. This means that exceptions should be used carefully
    because they weaken encapsulation. The more exceptions a function has, the more
    the caller function will have to anticipate, therefore knowing about the function
    it is calling. And if a function raises too many exceptions, this means that it
    is not so context-free, because every time we want to invoke it, we will have
    to keep all of its possible side effects in mind.
  id: totrans-80

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这个最后的概念非常重要；异常通常是为了通知调用者出现了某些问题。这意味着异常应该谨慎使用，因为它们会削弱封装性。一个函数拥有的异常越多，调用函数就需要越多的预期，因此需要了解它所调用的函数。如果一个函数抛出了太多的异常，这意味着它不是那么上下文无关的，因为每次我们想要调用它时，我们都需要记住它所有的可能副作用。
- en: This can be used as a heuristic to tell when a function is not sufficiently
    cohesive and has too many responsibilities. If it raises too many exceptions,
    it could be a sign that it has to be broken down into multiple, smaller ones.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '`ValueError` 与 `ConnectionError` 有什么关系？不多。通过观察这两种高度不同的错误类型，我们可以了解责任应该如何划分。'

    then handling said exception would be a way of doing it.'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '`ConnectionError` 应该在 `connect` 方法内部处理。这允许行为有清晰的分离。例如，如果这个方法需要支持重试，那么处理这个异常就是一种实现方式。'
- en: Conversely, `ValueError` belongs to the `decode` method of the event. With this
    new implementation (shown in the next example), this method does not need to catch
    any exception—the exceptions we were worrying about before are either handled

  id: totrans-90

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 相反，`ValueError` 属于事件的 `decode` 方法。在这个新的实现（在下一个示例中展示）中，这个方法不需要捕获任何异常——我们之前担心的异常要么被内部方法处理，要么被故意留下以引发。
- en: 'We should separate these fragments into different methods or functions. For
    the connection management, a small function should be enough. This function will

    of the method looks much more compact and easier to read:'
  id: totrans-93
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后，我们将在我们的方法中调用这个函数。至于事件上的 `ValueError` 异常，我们可以通过一个新的对象将其分离，并进行组合，但在这个有限的案例中，这将是过度设计，所以只需将逻辑移动到单独的方法就足够了。有了这两个考虑因素，方法的新版本看起来更加紧凑，更容易阅读：

    wasn't a clear separation of concerns. Then we decided the connection as a concern
    on itself, so in the next example, the `connect_with_retry` function was created,
    and `ConnectionError` was being handled as part of this function, if we needed
    to modify that function (as we had). On the other hand, the `ValueError` wasn't
    part of that same logic, so it was left in the `send` method where it belongs.
  id: totrans-95
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 现在看看异常类的分离如何也界定了责任的分离。在第一个示例中，一切都被混合在一起，没有明确的关注点分离。然后我们决定将连接作为一个单独的关注点，所以在下一个示例中，创建了
    `connect_with_retry` 函数，并且 `ConnectionError` 作为这个函数的一部分被处理，如果我们需要修改这个函数（就像我们做的那样）。另一方面，`ValueError`
    不属于那个相同的逻辑，所以它被留在了 `send` 方法中，那里才是它应该存在的地方。

    be suppressed when the program is running in production, but that defeats its
    purpose, because the point of them is to precisely let us know about those parts
    of the program that need to be fixed.

    catching `AssertionError`, the statement in the assertion is a function call.
    Function calls can have side effects, and they aren't always repeatable (we don't
    know if calling `condition.holds()` again will yield the same result). Moreover,
    if we stop the debugger at that line, we might not be able to conveniently see
    the result that causes the error, and, again, even if we call that function again,
    we don't know if that was the offending value.

    ask if assertions are moot, in the light of exception handling. Why would you
    want to assert for a condition if we can check that with an `if` statement and
    raise an exception? There's a subtle difference, though. In general, exceptions
    are for handling unexpected situations in relation to the business logic that
    our program will want to consider, whereas assertions are like self-checking mechanisms
    put in the code, to validate (assert) its correctness.

    statements. Typical uses of `assert` are situations where an algorithm maintains

    the algorithm is wrong or poorly implemented.'

    in the software from a starting point. This could be the case of an error or exception
    triggering a chain of other exceptions, causing failures that will result in a
    defect on a remote part of the application. It can also be that we have to change

    a simple change in a function definition.

    that defines certain components with its behavior that are defined by the interface
    of this class (its `public` methods and attributes), and then you need to specialize
    this class in order to create objects that do the same but with something else
    added, or with some particular parts of its behavior changed.

    itself. For example, in the `http.server` package ([https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler)),
    we can find a base class such as `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`, and subclasses such
    as `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler`, that extend this one by adding or changing part
    of its base interface.

    we want to enforce the interface of some objects, we can create an abstract base
    class that does not implement the behavior itself, but instead just defines the
    interface—every class that extends this one will have to implement these to be
    a proper subtype.

    standard exception in Python derives from `Exception`. This is what allows you
    to have a generic clause such as `except Exception`, which will catch every possible
    error. The important point is the conceptual one; they are classes derived from
    `Exception` because they are more specific exceptions. This also works in well-known
    libraries such as `requests`, for instance, in which an `HTTPError` is a `RequestException`,
    which, in turn, is an `IOError`.

    its records as satellite data, apply a change to a policy, or edit some of the

    hierarchy is wrong. Creating a new class from a base one conceptually means that
    it's a more specific version of the class it's extending (hence the name). How
    is it that a `TransactionalPolicy` is a dictionary? Does this make sense? Remember,
    this is part of the public interface of the object, so users will see this class
    and its hierarchy and will notice such an odd specialization as well as its public
    methods.

    policy now includes all methods from a dictionary. Does a transactional policy
    really need methods such as `pop()` or `items()`? However, there they are. They
    are also `public`, so any user of this interface is entitled to call them, with
    whatever undesired side effect they may carry. More on this point—we don't really
    gain much by extending a dictionary. The only method it actually needs to update
    for all customers affected by a change in the current policy (`change_in_policy()`)
    is not on the base class, so we will have to define it ourselves either way.

    in *Chapter 10*, *Clean Architecture*, when we explore this in the context of
    software architecture.

- en: In this chapter, we have explored several principles to achieve a clean design.
    Understanding that the code is part of the design is key to achieving high-quality
    software. This and the following chapter are focused precisely on that.

- en: With these ideas, we can now construct more robust code. For example, by applying
    DbC, we can create components that are guaranteed to work within their constraints.
    More importantly, if errors occur, this will not happen out of the blue, but instead,
    we will have a clear idea of who the offender is and which part of the code broke
    the contract. This compartmentalization is key to effective debugging.

- en: Along similar lines, each component can be made more robust if it defends itself
    from malicious intent or incorrect input. Although this idea goes in a different
    direction from DbC, it might complement it very well. Defensive programming is
    a good idea, especially for critical parts of the application.

- en: For both approaches (DbC and defensive programming), it's important to correctly
    handle assertions. Keep in mind how they should be used in Python, and don't use
    assertions as part of the control flow logic of the program. Don't catch this
    exception, either.

    the most important concept here is to avoid using exception as a control flow
    (`go-to`) kind of construction.

- en: We have explored a recurrent topic in object-oriented design—deciding between
    using inheritance or composition. The main lesson here is not to use one over
    the other, but to use whichever option is better; we should also avoid some common
    anti-patterns, which we might often see in Python (especially given its highly
    dynamic nature).

    for a clean design, always with the particularities of Python in mind.

    coming in the next chapter. We need to first understand these ideas so that we
    can move on to more advanced topics, such as SOLID principles.

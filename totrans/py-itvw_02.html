</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll</strong></span>: So could you tell me<a id="id35" class="indexterm"/> why you decided to become a computer programmer? </p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden</strong></span>: In essence, I was very fond of electronics in my early teens. I switched from chemistry to electronics because a chemistry teacher turned me off the subject.</p><p>So I started my career at the age of 15 as a trainee production engineer in a television factory. After 18 months, that wasn't really going as well as it should. I began to look around for new employment and I saw a job advertising a junior technician role at the computing laboratory, at my local university in Bradford. So I applied for the job and when I got there, it turned out that junior technician was just a job grade. What they actually wanted was a keypunch operator.</p><p>The director of the lab <a id="id36" class="indexterm"/>thought that I was in danger of going off the rails. He decided that I should take a job with the laboratory for six months and learn about computers. So obviously I didn't get into the electronics side of it, because in those days, computer maintenance was an extremely specialized job. But I learned how to operate a computer and I learned how to program. That was the start of my career in computing.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: That makes sense to me! So what made you start <a id="id37" class="indexterm"/>using Python and what makes it special to you?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: Well, in the early 1970s, I developed an interest in object-oriented programming when I finally, at the age of 23, went to university. I came across some of the early papers on Smalltalk from Alan Kay's group at Xerox PARC.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'In the early 1970s I developed an interest in object-oriented programming.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>The group seemed to have a very novel approach to computing, so I got interested in Smalltalk. Eventually, about 12 years later, when I was working at Manchester University, I actually got the chance to play with Smalltalk<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> for the first time. I got a research student to implement it for me. There was no UK implementation of Smalltalk at the time. I discovered that actually I didn't really like Smalltalk very much. So I gave up on object-oriented programming for about another 10 years.</p><p>It was actually when I moved to the United States that I came across a book on Python. I think it was <span class="emphasis"><em>Learning Python</em></span>, which was at that <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>time by Mark Lutz and David Ascher. I <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>realized that Python was the language for me! Python<a id="id41" class="indexterm"/> is a sensible, comprehensible, and understandable way to do object-oriented programming.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'I found that my knowledge of the language grew very quickly and pretty soon I was answering a lot of questions.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I did what people did in those days, which was to join the Python list. I found that my knowledge of the language grew very quickly and pretty soon I was answering a lot of questions. I think that in total I was active on comp.lang.python for about eight years. I made almost 200,000 posts! That's a lot of posts! Although unfortunately, I think that Google has let most of that stuff disappear now, so the history is gone from comp.lang.python.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Python is being used now in AI and machine learning. What do you think makes Python so popular?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: Python has several advantages: it's easy to<a id="id42" class="indexterm"/> read and you can experiment interactively with objects <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>that you create in a console or IDE. Python also provides relatively easy ways to interact with compiled languages that provide speed in large calculations (nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition).</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Do you think that there are any problems currently with the Python language or its community?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: The Python community (which is actually a large number of intersecting communities) just seems to go from strength to strength.</p><p>I am happy to say that Python appears to be widely accepted as a language, with a friendly and welcoming community. The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is now in a position to help to fund volunteer activities and offer a financial umbrella, as long as those activities promote and support the mission of the PSF.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is now in a position to help to fund volunteer activities and offer a financial umbrella.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Having just completed writing the third edition of <span class="emphasis"><em>Python in a Nutshell</em></span>, with Alex Martelli and Anna Ravenscroft, I would say that the language is in pretty good shape. However, I think that the new asynchronous primitives are proving to be more difficult for the average programmer to learn than they should be.</p><p>Guido van Rossum<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> and the other core developers have done a great job of not distorting the language too far in order to make the additions. But the asynchronous paradigm, that is so familiar to Twisted developers, isn't quite as intuitively obvious as a simple synchronous task specification.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'I am a little concerned that Python development isn't doing a whole lot for the average mainstream user.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>To be frank, I am a little concerned that Python<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/> development isn't doing a whole lot for the average mainstream user. A huge amount of work has been done to bring asynchronous programming into the language, which now includes a cooperative multitasking mechanism that obviates the need for threads.</p><p>As this work has proceeded, the developers have perceived a need for values that are private to the execution context of a specific asynchronous computation. You can think of them as <code class="literal">asyncio</code>'s equivalent of thread-local variables. As I've followed discussions on the Python-Dev list, I've seen much erudite discussion of issues that I suspect will never impact 99.5% of Python users. So I am thankful that Python is so dedicated to backward compatibility!</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'I've seen much erudite discussion of issues that I suspect will never impact 99.5% of Python users.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I feel similarly, although rather less strongly, about the introduction of annotations to Python. They were first proposed as an entirely optional element of the language, but because people are using them, they are raising issues that are increasing the pressure to allow annotations in places like the standard library.</p><p>I'd like it to be possible for beginners to continue to learn the language, while remaining totally unaware of even the possibility of annotations, which can then be added later and completely orthogonally to the rest of the language. I'm not confident that this will continue to be the case.</p><p>Looking on the bright side, the relatively simple development of the f-string notation has been so enthusiastically adopted by the Python 3 community, that lots of code is being written that won't run on 3.5, simply because it uses f-strings. As <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>usual, Dave Beazley has found diabolical things to do with f-strings, which is always fun.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How can we overcome those issues?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: I'm not sure that there's any need for huge efforts to overcome those issues. It's important not to become complacent and to keep up the efforts to improve the language and broaden its community to become ever larger and more diverse. PyCon proved that technical communities can, to a <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>large extent, be self-organizing.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll: I know that you have been the chairman of PSF and PyCon in the past. How did you first become involved?</strong></span>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: I went to my first, and effectively the last, International Python Conference in 2002. While the content was great, the event was run by a commercial group that did a lot of business with Guido's then employer, so it was geared to those who had the budget to attend.</p><p>While this had been fine in the early days of the language, it was obvious to me that if Python was going to be really popular, then its conference needed to offer a home to many more people. This included the people that I was engaging with on a daily basis on comp.lang.python.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'If Python was going to be really popular, then its conference needed to offer a home to many more people.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>At the end of that conference, Guido made an announcement about the Python Software Authority (PSA), a more-or-less national<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> governance body. PSA was to be replaced by a non-profit foundation. Guido also announced the creation of a mailing list to discuss conferences, which I eagerly anticipated!</p><p>Sadly, the <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>archives (<a class="ulink" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/conferences/">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/conferences/</a>) only appear to go back to May 2009. But I remember when I last looked at the complete collection, my memory of waiting a long time for anything to appear was completely false. It took me about two days to become the first poster in the list. I expressed my opinion that the community could and would do a better job of organizing the conference, on a purely community basis.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'I expressed my opinion that the community could and would do a better job of organizing the conference.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I had the good fortune, completely by accident, to move to Virginia. This was within 20 or 30 miles of where Guido, Jeremy Hylton, Barry Warsaw, and Fred Drake were working at different places, while they collaborated on core Python.</p><p>That crew, along with Tim Peters, who had until then <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>lived in Boston, got together as employees of a company called BeOS. It looked like that collaboration had a bright future and so it was a terrible blow when it became obvious after about six months that BeOS was in trouble. Fortunately, Zope Corporation, which is now Digital Creations, rented an office space for them and they established PythonLabs.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: How did you start <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>working with the Python team?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: I had become known due to my voluminous contributions on comp.lang.python and the publication of<a id="id52" class="indexterm"/> Python Web Programming in 2002.</p><p>So when I contacted Guido and suggested that we meet for lunch, he invited me out to the office of PythonLabs. I met all five of the team and then we went out for a Chinese lunch at a place close by. These meetings became regular events every couple of weeks or so and one of the topics of discussion became whether the community really could get behind the idea of having no professional organizers.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'One of the topics of discussion became whether the community really could get behind the idea of having no professional organizers.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I think by the late 1990s, Guido realized that something a bit more formal was required and so the guys from PythonLabs started the PSF and acquired a certain amount of donated funding. I explained that I'd been the treasurer of DECUS UK &amp; Ireland in the past and had experience of community conferences. Guido said that if I would agree to chair the conference, then the PSF would underwrite the costs.</p><p>We rented space in The George Washington University's Cafritz Conference Center and announced the dates, which received general excitement. Then the informal team quickly established the PyCon-organizers list. I remember that we got a lot of help from Nate Torkington, who had established the YAPC (Yet Another Perl Conference)<a id="id53" class="indexterm"/> idea.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'The ethos soon emerged that everything possible would be done by volunteers, to keep costs down.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>The ethos soon emerged that everything possible would be done by volunteers, to keep costs down. Catherine<a id="id54" class="indexterm"/> Devlin stepped in to organize the food (taking account of everyone's dietary preferences is an impossible task). I can't even remember how the tickets were sold, since utility sites weren't available then.</p><p>About 250 people turned up for the conference, which was preceded by a two-day sprint and tutorials session. All talks were well attended. There was a real buzz and I went around trying to make sure that everyone got onto the internet.</p><p>That conference brought the Twisted team together in person for the first time. When I learned that they were having networking problems (most systems back in those days still needed an Ethernet cable), I impressed them by installing a local 100 MHz hub just for them.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Was the conference a financial success?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: At the end of the conference, I announced that it appeared that the event had made roughly $17,000 for the PSF.</p><p>Guido proposed that I be given half of the profits, but I objected on the grounds that the PSF needed to build up its reserves. He also proposed me as a PSF member, an honour that I was happy to accept. I was duly voted in.</p><p>At OSCON<a id="id55" class="indexterm"/> that year, I interviewed Guido (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/08/14/gvr_interview.html">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2003/08/14/gvr_interview.html</a>) and he talked about the need to get some more experienced hands involved with the PSF, which at the time he was leading due to the recognition that his name lent to the enterprise.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'I've never been a big fan of community events becoming the property of individuals.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>At the end of the second PyCon, which was in the same venue a year later, I announced that I would chair one more conference. I've never been a big fan of community events becoming the property of individuals and chairing had been taking up an enormous amount of my time. Fortunately, most of my income back then came from teaching work and flexible consulting, that I could do largely from home.</p><p>If memory serves me correctly, it was that year that I was elected to the PSF board. Guido stood down as chairman and the board elected Stephan Deibel to replace him, asking Guido to continue to serve as titular present. This meant that what time he had available could be focused on development, rather than administrivia.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So, at what point did you step down from your role as chair of the conference?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: At the end of the third PyCon, which was again and for the final time in Washington DC, nobody had stood up to chair the next conference. I couldn't even tell them that there was going to be a conference the following year, let alone when and where it would be.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'I held firm in my belief that if PyCon was going to make it, then even broader support needed to be attracted from the community.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>I received several requests to chair one more conference, but I held firm in my belief that if PyCon was going to make it, then even broader support needed to be attracted from the community. About two months later, Andrew Kuchling approached me to ask what was involved and bless him he ran the next two conferences, which were held in Dallas, Texas. They marked the transition to using fully commercial venues and with that, PyCon has gone from strength to strength.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: If someone wants to learn programming, why should they choose Python?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: That depends on what age they are. I'd suggest that up to about the age of ten, a visual programming system like Scratch might be more appropriate.</p><p>Beyond that age, Python is<a id="id56" class="indexterm"/> definitely accessible enough to be a good first programming language. There is a huge amount of open source Python code in diverse areas. Nowadays, whatever field you work in, it's likely that there will be some Python code that you can use as a starting point.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'Python is definitely accessible enough to be a good first programming language.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: So what coding techniques<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/> do you recommend?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: I'm a big fan of test-driven development, despite having spent my first 30 years as a programmer not doing it. I see Agile as being more desirable from a business point of view, because it allows all stakeholders to select the work that's going to add most value to the business.</p><p>I've just spent almost a year and a half working with a perversion of that approach. I'm looking forward to validating in my new job that when run sensibly, Agile methods are a productive way to work. But I see Agile less as a coding technique and more as a development management methodology.</p><p>Pair programming isn't used as much as it used to be, but I think that from a technology transfer point of view, it's an incredible communications tool. Younger programmers don't seem to spend much time on career development, but as a manager I want to see my staff growing and learning. Pair programming is one way that they can acquire new skills relatively painlessly.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: After learning the basics of Python, what next?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: Look around for a problem that interests you and see if there are any open source projects in that area.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'While every new programmer likes to think that they can break ground, it's actually much easier to learn by collaborating.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>While every new programmer likes to think that they can break ground, it's actually much easier to learn by collaborating in a team that knows what it's doing. Teamwork can teach you the practical software engineering skills that are so valuable in becoming an effective programmer.</p><p>People like to say that anyone can code, but signs are now emerging that this may not be true. Anyway, being able to code alone is nowhere near enough to build practical, functional and maintainable systems. Acquiring those other skills shouldn't be left until you have mastered programming.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mike Driscoll: What about Python today most excites you?</strong></span>
</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: The really exciting thing is the continued development of Python communities and the increase in Python usage, especially in education. This will ensure that relatively comprehensible programming tools will be readily available to anyone that needs them over the next 20 years.</p><p>I have on my desk a FiPy device that has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa, Sigfox, and cellular communications on-chip, controlled by a MicroPython controller that, besides having the usual hardware bells and whistles, like digital inputs and outputs, gives REPL access to all of that functionality. I can hardly wait to retire and play with these things properly. Imagine what is going to become available over the next 10 years!</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Where do you see the Python language<a id="id58" class="indexterm"/> going in the future?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: I'm not really sure where the language is going. You hear loose talk of Python 4. To my mind though, Python is now at the stage where it's complex enough.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Steve Holden: 'You hear loose talk of Python 4. To my mind though, Python is now at the stage where it's complex enough.'</strong></span>
</p></blockquote></div><p>Python hasn't bloated in the same way that I think the Java environment has. At that maturity level, I think it's rather more likely that Python's ideas will spawn other, perhaps more specialized, languages aimed at particular areas of application. I see this as fundamentally healthy and I have no wish to make all programmers use Python for everything; language choices should be made on pragmatic grounds.</p><p>I've never been much of a one for pushing for change. Enough smart people are thinking about that already. So mostly I lurk on Python-Dev and occasionally interject a view from the consumer side, when I think that things are becoming a little too esoteric.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Should people move over to Python 3?</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Holden</strong></span>: Only when they need to. There will inevitably be systems written in 2.7 that won't get migrated. I hope that their operators will collectively form an industry-wide support group, to extend the lifetimes of those systems beyond the 2020 deadline for Python-Dev support. However, anyone starting out with Python should clearly learn Python 3 and that is increasingly the case.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Driscoll</strong></span>: Thank you, Steve Holden.</p></div></body></html>

			<p>If all of our code was simply executed in sequence, our programs would always do the same thing, no matter what data we provided them with. We must be able to control the path through the program so that some part of the code executes at the designated time, and other parts at other times, depending on the values provided by the data. For instance, only if it is cold outside do you put on warm clothes, not always. The same thing applies to our code. When things are a certain way, we want something to happen. </p>
			<p>In a way, we can say that we, by this, will introduce some sort of intelligence, or at least some decision-making capabilities into our code. If things are this way, do this, if not, do that.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Controlling the execution path of the program</li>
				<li>Making decisions with the help of <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements</li>
				<li>Selecting one out of many options with <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements </li>
				<li>Repeating code execution with <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loops</li>
				<li>Iterating over code until a condition is false using <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong></li>
				<li>Going over a sequence of data, one item at the time using <strong class="source-inline">for each</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this chapter, we will dive into some real programming. In the topics that we will cover here, we will be able to control the execution path of the program. Let's first explore what that means.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Controlling the execution path</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B15554_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sequence â€“ The Basic Building Block of a Computer Program</em>, we learned that the code within a program is executed in sequence.</p>
			<p>A sequence <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>is one of the three basic logical structures we have in programming. So, in this chapter, we will cover the other two, <em class="italic">selection</em> and <em class="italic">iteration</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Selection statements</h2>
			<p>There are situations when we only want to execute some code if a condition is met. For example, if you recall <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>our application from <a href="B15554_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor081"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sequence - The Basic Building Block of a Computer Program </em>which turned on <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>the outdoor light, we had a condition that said if our phone detected that we were within a given range from our house, it should send a signal to the home computer. To refresh your memory, let's take a look at some images you have seen before. <em class="italic">Figure 7.1</em> was used to illustrate the action of us entering the range:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer117" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15554_07_01.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1: The phone detects that it is within a given range from our house"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1: The phone detects that it is within a given range from our house</p>
			<p>Then, we have a condition. We used the illustration shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em> to indicate that when the condition was true, that is, we are within the range, a signal shoul<a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>d be sent to the home computer:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer118" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15554_07_02.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2: The condition is met, so the code for sending the message can be executed"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2: The condition is met, so the code for sending the message can be executed</p>
			<p>Let's break it down a bit more and consider the actual steps involved. The application on the phone would need to do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Ask the GPS on the phone for the current position.</li>
				<li>With the help of the given coordinates, calculate the distance to our home.</li>
				<li>If the distance is within a given range from our house, then send a signal to the home computer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you can see, in <em class="italic">step 3</em>, we have a condition that states that the signal will only be sent if the condition is true. So, here, we have some code that will not always be executed. We call this selection. We could define selection like this: <em class="italic">selection is the ability to execute a section of code only if a condition is met.</em></p>
			<p>Now we can ask ourselves another question. What should we do if the condition is false, that is, we are not within the range? Well, for this application, the answer is nothing. If we are not in the range, then we won't need to do anything. </p>
			<p>The phone app also had another feature that is interesting to us now. When we have finished checking whether <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>we are within the range or not, we will either send a signal to <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>the home computer or do nothing. After that, we will go back to the beginning and repeat everything again so that we can be ready to check whether, after the movement, we are in the given range. We call this an <em class="italic">iteration</em>. We will learn what this is next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Iteration statements</h2>
			<p>An iteration is when we want to repeat something several times. It can also be referred to as a loop. The number <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>of times we want to iterate something can be in the range of 2 to infinity. Now, in programming, infinity has a somewhat different perspective on things than you <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>and I would usually have. Infinity in programming does not mean forever and ever, but more like as long as the program is running. So, in programming, infinity ends when the program ends.</p>
			<p>In the outdoor light app, we had an iteration. The following diagram illustrates the sequence for our phone app, and here we can clearly see the iteration:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer119" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15554_07_03.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3: The two arrows pointing at the top item indicate iteration"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3: The two arrows pointing at the top item indicate iteration</p>
			<p>The diamond shape in the diagram is a condition. If the condition is true, that is, the answer is yes, that we send the signal. We can also see that no matter whether the condition was true or false, we will go back to the beginning. This app will continue to repeat these steps over and over an infinite number of times, that is, until you close the app or turn off your phone.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, we only want to iterate a fixed number of times. Let's say that you are implementing an e-commerce solution, and a customer wants to check out all of the items that are currently in the shopping cart. You would need to iterate over all of the items in the cart to calculate the total price. If there were 5 items in the cart, then you would need to iterate 5 times.</p>
			<p>Both selection <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>and iteration use conditions, so before we look <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>at the different kinds of selection and iteration statements, let's take a closer look at what a conditional statement is and how it works.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Conditional statements</h2>
			<p>We have covered the basics of this in several chapters already. A conditional statement is just a statement <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>that can result in either true or false. The following is a list of examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>raining today.</li>
				<li>Your age is below 20.</li>
				<li>Your credit card has expired.</li>
				<li>Your coffee cup is empty.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All of these will result in either true or false. There are no maybes. It is either raining or not; you are either below 20 or not, and so on. </p>
			<p>We have also seen that conditional statements can be combined with logical AND, or logical OR, to form a new, compound <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>conditional statement. Here are some examples:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is raining today, and I have blue shoes.</li>
				<li>Your age is below 20, or it is above 60.</li>
				<li>Your credit card has expired, and you have no cash.</li>
				<li>Your coffee cup is empty, and your coffee machine is broken.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These compound, or full, statements are made up of two individual statements. <em class="italic">It is raining today</em> is one part, and <em class="italic">I have blue shoes</em> is another part. The two now need to be combined to form a full statement that can be either true or false. In the preceding example, we use <em class="italic">and</em> to combine them. This means that both individual statements need to be true for the whole statement to be true. It must be raining, <em class="italic">and</em> I must have blue shoes.</p>
			<p>If we look at <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>the second statement, the two smaller statements are combined with an <em class="italic">or</em>. This means that, for the whole statement to be true, at least <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>one of the parts must be true. Either your card has expired, <em class="italic">or</em> you have no cash. It could also be unfortunate that both are true, and then the entire statement will be true.</p>
			<p>Now we know that we have selection and iteration statements and that they work with conditions, so let's see how we can write code that uses them. Let's start with the most common selection statement, <strong class="source-inline">if</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Selection with the if statement</h1>
			<p>When using selection in our programs, we could argue that the application uses some sort of <em class="italic">intelligence</em> because <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>it can now make decisions and do different things <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>depending on various conditions. So, how can we make our applications smart? Well, the easiest way is with the use of <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements, which are, sometimes, just referred to as <em class="italic">conditions</em>. In most languages, they will have a similar structure.</p>
			<p>If we write a small program that asks the user for their age, the first part might look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print "Enter your age: "</p>
			<p class="source-code">input age</p>
			<p>Here, the program prints <strong class="source-inline">Enter your age:</strong> on the screen. The user then enters an age and presses the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key to confirm the input. The value entered will be stored in the <strong class="source-inline">age</strong> variable.</p>
			<p>Now we want to give different feedback depending on the age entered:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if age &lt; 18 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are young"</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_if</p>
			<p>Here, we have the condition where we check whether the age is below <strong class="source-inline">18</strong>. If so, we will print the message, <strong class="source-inline">You are young</strong>. The condition is that the age must be below <strong class="source-inline">18</strong>. If it is <strong class="source-inline">18</strong> or above, nothing will happen, as the program will skip everything between them and end the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement.</p>
			<p>If, instead, we want to check for an interval, we could create a compound conditional statement, as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if age &gt;= 13 and age &lt;= 19 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are a teenager"</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_if</p>
			<p>As you can see, we are combining the two parts that make up the condition with an <strong class="source-inline">and</strong>. This means <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>that both conditions must be true for the whole condition to be true. The age must be greater or equal to <strong class="source-inline">13</strong>, and, at the same time, it must be less than or equal to <strong class="source-inline">19</strong>. This will give us a range between 13 and 19, with <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>both values included. If the age falls into this range, we will enter the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement and print the text. If it is either less than 13 or greater than 19, nothing will happen.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement comes with an optional part. This section is called <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> and marks a block of code that will be executed only if the condition in the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement is false. This is shown in the following code: </p>
			<p class="source-code">if age &gt;= 13 and age &lt;= 19 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are a teenager"</p>
			<p class="source-code">else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are not a teenager"</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_if</p>
			<p>The difference here is that, now, we will always have something printed on the screen. Either the condition is true, and the message will be printed, or the condition is false and the section between <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">end_if</strong> will be executed. Additionally, note that the part that will be executed when the condition is true now ends with the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> keyword.</p>
			<p>We can have more than one statement in each of the sections if we want to:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if age &gt;= 13 and age &lt;= 19 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are a teenager"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "I hope you are having fun."</p>
			<p class="source-code">else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are not a teenager"</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_if</p>
			<p>Now, if the age <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>falls into the teenage range, we will print two lines. And, if it is false, we will still only print one line.</p>
			<p>If we want to <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>have more complex logic, we can have nested <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements. That means we can have new <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements either in the section that executes if the condition is true or on the part that only executes if the condition is false.</p>
			<p>For example, if the condition in the preceding code is false, we know that you are either younger or older than the teenage years. If we want to distinguish this further, it is in this section of the code that we can check it:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if age &gt;= 13 and age &lt;= 19 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are a teenager"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "I hope you are having fun."</p>
			<p class="source-code">else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â if age &lt; 13 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "You are a child"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "You are getting old"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â end_if</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_if</p>
			<p>Now the logic is a bit more complicated. If the user of our program responded with an age that is between 13 and 19, nothing has changed. However, if the age is anything else, we have a new <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement. As this one is located within the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> section of the first one, we know that the age is either below <strong class="source-inline">13</strong> or above <strong class="source-inline">13</strong>. The second <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement checks whether it is less than <strong class="source-inline">13</strong>. And, if so, prints the <strong class="source-inline">You are a child</strong> message. </p>
			<p>Now, think about what condition we have if we enter the second <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> section. First, we know that age is not between 13 and 19, or we would not be in this part of the program at all. We also know that the age is not below 13 because, if it was, we would have executed the <strong class="source-inline">You are a child</strong> part. We only have one option left; the age must be above 19.</p>
			<p>To have an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement directly following an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement, like we just saw, is so common that some languages have a special construct for it, called <strong class="source-inline">elif</strong>. In such a language, the same code would look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if age &gt;= 13 and age &lt;= 19 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are a teenager"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "I hope you are having fun. "</p>
			<p class="source-code">elif age &lt; 13 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are a child"</p>
			<p class="source-code">else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are getting old"</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_if</p>
			<p>The logic of <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>the program is the same, but the code is more compact. As you can see, we have the second condition, if the age is below 13, on the same line as the old <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement, and the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> statement has now changed into an <strong class="source-inline">elif</strong> statement. The word, <strong class="source-inline">elif</strong>, is just made <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>up of the two words, <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">if</strong>.</p>
			<p>Additionally, note that, in the first example, the program ended with two lines containing <strong class="source-inline">end_if</strong>. The second version just has one. </p>
			<p>If you look at the second program, you can now clearly see that there are three different sections and that only one of them will be executed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If the age is between 13 and 19, we enter the first section and execute the code within that block. After that, we are done, and the rest of the code will be skipped.</li>
				<li>If the age is below 13, we will first skip the first part and go to the <strong class="source-inline">elif</strong> part. The condition here is true, so we will enter this part and execute the code within. After that, we are done and can, again, skip to the end.</li>
				<li>Finally, if the age is greater than 19, we will first skip over the first section and go to the <strong class="source-inline">elif</strong> part. The condition found here will also be evaluated to false, so we skip ahead to the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> part. As this part does not contain any condition, we will always end up here if none of the preceding conditions were true.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Even if the language we are using does not have an <strong class="source-inline">elif</strong> statement, we can create the same logic anyway. Consider the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if age &gt;= 13 and age &lt;= 19 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are a teenager"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "I hope you are having fun. "</p>
			<p class="source-code">else if age &lt; 13 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are a child"</p>
			<p class="source-code">else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "You are getting old"</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_if</p>
			<p>You can see that the only thing that has changed here is that the <strong class="source-inline">elif</strong> statement has been replaced with the two words, <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">if</strong>. The rest is the same and the logic is also unchanged.</p>
			<p>To use this idea with nested <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements such as this can be very efficient. First, we must understand <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>that we can have as many of these as we need. The structure <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>can then look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if condition1 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â do option1</p>
			<p class="source-code">elif condition2 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â do option2</p>
			<p class="source-code">elif condition3 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â do option3</p>
			<p class="source-code">elif conditon4 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â do option5</p>
			<p class="source-code">else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â do option6</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_if</p>
			<p>If you look at this structure, you can see that this looks like a fork, where we only can choose one of the tines:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer120" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B15554_07_04.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4: Nested if statements are like a fork"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4: Nested if statements are like a fork</p>
			<p>When we <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>have one out of many things that can be true, we do <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>have an option. It is another fork-like structure that works pretty much the same way as the nested <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement we just saw. It is called a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement. We will study this next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Selection with the switch statement</h1>
			<p>One alternative, when we have one option out of many that can be true, is the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement. It also works with conditions even if they are not as apparent as they are in an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement.</p>
			<p>Another difference is that a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement only compares values for equality. The reason for it is that it is not <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>suitable for the age logic we used when we explored the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, as we wanted to see whether the age was between two values. Instead, it is perfect if <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>we're going to match it to a value that is fixed. We will soon look at a real example. However, first, let's explore the structure of a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement.</p>
			<p>What a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement looks like depends on what language we use. What we will see here is a structure that is rather common, but when applying it, you will need to look up the correct syntax for your language.</p>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement begins by stating what variable we want to check. It is common for languages to use the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> keyword for this.</p>
			<p>The structure looks something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">switch(variable)</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_switch</p>
			<p>In this example, the name, <strong class="source-inline">variable</strong>, is just a placeholder for the actual variable we want to work with. Between the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> keyword and <strong class="source-inline">end_switch</strong>, we will need to specify each value we want to compare the variable to. It could look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">switch(variable)</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â case 1:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â case 2:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â case 3:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_switch</p>
			<p>Each case specifies the value that we compare the variable to. The first case compares it to <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, the second to <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, and so on. The ellipsis (<strong class="source-inline">...</strong>) marks the location where we will insert the code for each option. The first ellipsis is to indicate which code will be executed if the variable is <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, the second for when the value is <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, and so on.</p>
			<p>In many languages, we have something that is called a <em class="italic">fallthrough</em>. What this means is that when the right value is found, the code within that <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> statement will execute, but then the code in all the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> statements that follow will also execute. So, if the value of the variable is <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, the code for both <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> will execute. The reason it does that is so that we can have multiple <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> instances following each other and just one code block for them.</p>
			<p>To indicate that <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>we want the fallthrough to stop, we must give <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>an instruction that we are done, and we can now jump to the end of the <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement. This instruction is, usually, <strong class="source-inline">break</strong>. It is shown in the following example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">switch (variable)</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â case 0:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "Zero"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 1:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 3:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 4:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 7:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 8:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "Odd value"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 2:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 4:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 6:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 8:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "Even value"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_switch</p>
			<p>Normally, we have one value for each case block, so the code will look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">switch(variable)</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case 1:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case 2:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case 3:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_switch</p>
			<p>If the value <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>of the variable is <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, the code within that block will execute, and when the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement is reached, the execution of the whole <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement will end. This is good, as only one of the options can be true. So, if one <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>has been executed, we know that we are done.</p>
			<p>You could argue that the <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement in the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> block for the value of <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> is unnecessary as we don't have any more statements that we can fall through to. However, it is a good practice to have it there because we might add more options in the future, and then we wouldn't want to take the risk of forgetting to add that <strong class="source-inline">break</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statements <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>also have something that resembles the <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> part <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>of an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement, that is, a block that would execute if no other values evaluated to true. In a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement, this is called <strong class="source-inline">default</strong>. It usually comes at the very end, after all of the <strong class="source-inline">case</strong> statements. It can look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">switch(variable)</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case 1:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case 2:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â case 3:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â default:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_switch</p>
			<p>Again, the last <strong class="source-inline">break</strong> statement is optional, but we keep it there for consistency. Note that now we can appreciate that we had a break within number <strong class="source-inline">3</strong>, since, without it, a value of <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> would first execute the code in the <strong class="source-inline">3</strong> block and then fall through to the default block.</p>
			<p>Now we have <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>all the parts of a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement in place, so let's look at an example of when and how it can be used.</p>
			<p>Here, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>ask the user of our program to input the numeric value for a month, that is, <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> for January, <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> for February, and so on. We will store the number the user entered in a variable we call <strong class="source-inline">month</strong>. We can now use this variable in a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement to figure out the name that matches the number the user gave us. Consider the following code:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print "Enter a month number: "</p>
			<p class="source-code">input month</p>
			<p class="source-code">switch (month) </p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 1:Â Â </p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â month_string = "January"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 2:Â Â </p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â month_string = "February"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 3:Â Â </p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â month_string = "March"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â case 12: </p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â month_string = "December"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â default:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â month_string = "Invalid"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â break</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_switch</p>
			<p class="source-code">print "The name of the month you entered is " + month_string</p>
			<p>In the preceding code, months 4 to 11 are left out, but they are repeated using the same pattern. </p>
			<p>Let's say the <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>user enters <strong class="source-inline">8</strong>. The program will start at the top and <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>check case <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>. If this has been an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement instead of a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong>, case <strong class="source-inline">1</strong> would be equivalent to this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if month == 1 then</p>
			<p>Since the user entered <strong class="source-inline">8</strong> and not <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, this is false, so the program will go to the next case, <strong class="source-inline">case 2</strong>, and try again. There is still no luck, so it will continue all the way down to <strong class="source-inline">case 8</strong>, where it finally gets a match. It will now enter this block and create a variable called <strong class="source-inline">month_string</strong> and assign the value of <strong class="source-inline">August</strong> to it.</p>
			<p>On the next line, it hits a <strong class="source-inline">break</strong>. This means, "get me out of here," so the program will now skip all of the other tests because it knows that it is done.</p>
			<p>If the user entered an invalid month, say <strong class="source-inline">14</strong>, all cases will first be checked, but as none will be true, the code in the <strong class="source-inline">default</strong> block will execute and the <strong class="source-inline">month_string</strong> variable will get an <strong class="source-inline">Invalid</strong> value.</p>
			<p>On the very last line, the text, <strong class="source-inline">The name of the month you entered is</strong>, will be printed, and the value we have in our <strong class="source-inline">month_string</strong> variable will be appended to the end.</p>
			<p>The execution of the program would look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Enter a month number: 8</p>
			<p class="source-code">The name of the month you entered is August</p>
			<p>With the help of the selection structures, <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong>, we can build complex logic.</p>
			<p>When designing a solution, you should keep a couple of things in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is easy to get a bit confused as the logic will, at times, feel entangled and hard to understand. It is, therefore, essential to remember what we said earlier in this book: try to zoom in to one small subproblem, understand it, and design a solution for it. When that is in place, you can zoom out a bit and examine how it works in a bigger context. Then, you can repeat this process. This might sound very abstract but keep it in the back of your mind, and try to use this approach when you feel that a problem is getting too complex.</li>
				<li>Always remember that the readability of your code counts. What this means is that if you have a solution that works but the code is very complex and hard to read, you should go back and try to rewrite it, making sure that it still works but also that <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>another programmer (or you in the future) easily can read and understand what the code does.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>have covered two of the three fundamental pillars that programming rests upon, sequence and selection, it is time to tackle the last one, iteration.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Iteration with the for loop</h1>
			<p>The first type of iteration we will look at is the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. This is a kind of loop when we, in one way or the other, know how <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>many times we want to repeat something. This <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>can be a fixed number of times, such as iterating over a list using the days of the week. We know it is always 7. It can also be that we have values in an array. We might not know precisely how many items there are in the array at any given time; however, as we will see, there are ways to ask the array how many objects it is currently holding. </p>
			<p>When using a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, we will work with a variable that keeps track of how many times we have iterated. We can decide what value this variable shall start on. It is this variable that helps us to know when to stop iterating. Let's look at an example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for i = 0 to 10</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_for</p>
			<p>Here, we create (or declare, as a programmer would say) a variable called <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>. The name, <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, is frequently used as the name for this variable since it is often used as an index. However, we will discuss that in more detail later. After the assignment operator (<strong class="source-inline">=</strong>), we say that we want to give <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> a starting value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. We will then repeat the code within the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> block and <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> will be increased by one for each iteration. The value of <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> is the stop condition. When <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> has reached this value, it should stop repeating and continue executing the code that comes after the loop.</p>
			<p>If we print the value that <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> currently has inside the loop, the code will look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for i = 0 to 10</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print i</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_for</p>
			<p>Most languages will print the values of 0 to 9 and not 0 to 10. That might seem strange, but if we look at the logic that the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop uses, we can understand why that is.</p>
			<p>When we first hit the line with the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, the variable, <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, is created and initialized with the value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, since we said that we want this as our starting value.</p>
			<p>It will then <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>compare the value that <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> has with the second value we gave, <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>. If they are equal, the loop will stop. As this is the first iteration, the value is 0 and they are <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>not equal; therefore, the code inside the loop will execute. When we come back up to the line with the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop again, the value in <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is incremented by one, that is, 0 + 1 = 1. This value is now compared to our end value, <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>. This is still not a match. It will continue like this until the value of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">9</strong>. When returning to the line with the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop again, it will increase <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> by <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, making it <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>. Now, when the values are compared, they will be equal and the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop will end. So, we will never enter the loop when <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> has the value of <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> and that is why we only see the values of 0 to 9 printed.</p>
			<p>As mentioned before in this book, the C programming language has had a huge impact on the syntax of many other languages. The way in which <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loops are written is such an example. Let's examine what the same <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop would look like in C:</p>
			<p class="source-code">int i;</p>
			<p class="source-code">for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)</p>
			<p class="source-code">{</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â printf("%d", i);</p>
			<p class="source-code">}</p>
			<p>On the first line, we declare the variable, <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, also stating that it shall work with the data type, <strong class="source-inline">int</strong>. In the C language, statements end with a semicolon. That is why we have one after the <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> variable.</p>
			<p>Then comes the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. In C, we have three sections in a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. They are separated using semicolons. The first is the initialization. That is where we say <strong class="source-inline">i = 0</strong>. This means that <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> will have a value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> in the first iteration. </p>
			<p>The second part is the condition that states how long we shall continue to loop. Here, we say <strong class="source-inline">i &lt; 10.</strong> We can read this as <em class="italic">continue as long as i is less than 10</em>. </p>
			<p>The last section indicates how <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> will change in each iteration. Here, we say <strong class="source-inline">i++</strong>. This is C's way of saying, <em class="italic">take whatever is in the variable, </em><strong class="source-inline">i</strong>,<em class="italic"> right now and increase it by one, then store the new value in </em><strong class="source-inline">i</strong>.</p>
			<p>The line inside the loop might look a bit strange. But there is no need to go into all of the details of how C handles printing values, as it is far more complicated than in most languages. The only thing we need to know is that it <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>will print the current value of <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>.</p>
			<p>The output will be the same as in our earlier example, <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">9</strong>. Here, we can see why the value of 10 is not printed because the condition says <strong class="source-inline">i &lt; 10</strong>. When <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>, this is no longer true, and the loop will exit. If we, instead, had <strong class="source-inline">i &lt;= 10</strong>, the value of <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> would be included.</p>
			<p>The languages <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>that use this style include C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Go. With slight variations, they all have <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loops that use the three sections that we saw in the C loop.</p>
			<p>For simplicity, we will not use the C-style loops in this book but stick to the first version we looked at instead. This will help us to focus on how <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loops work without being distracted by the syntax for writing them.</p>
			<p>If we want to change the loop variable in any other way than just increasing it by one, we can do that as follows:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for i = 0 to 10 step 2</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print i</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_for</p>
			<p>Here, we will increment the value that <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> has by <strong class="source-inline">2</strong> each time. The output of this program will be similar the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">2</p>
			<p class="source-code">4</p>
			<p class="source-code">6</p>
			<p class="source-code">8</p>
			<p>It still starts at 0, but as we increment by <strong class="source-inline">2</strong>, all the odd numbers will be skipped. Just like earlier, we are exiting the loop when <strong class="source-inline">i</strong> reaches <strong class="source-inline">10</strong>.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, we want to put a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop inside another <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. This is called a nested <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. We will need two different variables for these loops so that they don't interfere with each other. As an example, we might want to go over all 7 days of the week. We will print the days such as <strong class="source-inline">day 0</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">day 1</strong>, and so on. We will start at 0 for simplicity, but we could, of course, have started at 1 if we wanted to.</p>
			<p>For each day, we want to print all of the hours of that day. If we think about it, we will need a loop for the days. When we are inside this loop, we can imagine that we are working with one single day. For this day, we will need to print all of the hours. Then, when we are done, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>need to repeat the process for the next day. Instead of using the variable name, <strong class="source-inline">i</strong>, we can use more meaningful names for the two loops. We will use <strong class="source-inline">day</strong> for the loop that handles the days and <strong class="source-inline">hour</strong> for the loop that controls the hours.</p>
			<p>This is what the program should look like:</p>
			<p class="source-code"> for day = 0 to 7</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "day " + day</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â for hour = 0 to 24</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "hour " + hour</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â end for</p>
			<p class="source-code"> end for</p>
			<p>The output <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>would look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">day 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 2</p>
			<p class="source-code">â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 23</p>
			<p class="source-code">day 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 0 </p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 1</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 2</p>
			<p class="source-code">â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">day 6</p>
			<p class="source-code">â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 21</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 22</p>
			<p class="source-code">hour 23</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">We are leaving out parts of this long output. The parts left out are indicated by an ellipsis.</p>
			<p>If we follow the logic of this program, we can see that we first start out with the outermost loop, that is, the one that handles the days. We have a variable called <strong class="source-inline">day</strong> and assign it to the starting value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>.</p>
			<p>Then, we print the text, <strong class="source-inline">day</strong>, and append the value stored in the variable named <strong class="source-inline">day</strong>. Note that <strong class="source-inline">day</strong> within quotes is a string that will be printed as it is, and <strong class="source-inline">day</strong> without quotes is the variable.</p>
			<p>Then, we come to the innermost loop. This will handle the hours. This also starts out with a value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> and uses a variable called <strong class="source-inline">hour</strong>. It will print the current hour in the same way that we did with the days.</p>
			<p>The program will run inside the inner loop until we get a value of <strong class="source-inline">24</strong> inside the variable, <strong class="source-inline">hour</strong>. Then, it will exit. The program will now go back to the beginning of the outer loop, the one handling days. It will increase the <strong class="source-inline">day</strong> variable by one, and check whether it is less than <strong class="source-inline">7</strong>. And, because it is, we will enter the loop, and the process will repeat.</p>
			<p>It is also <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>possible to go backward in a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. We just need to switch the <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>starting and end values and decrease the loop variable instead of increasing it. It can look something like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">for i = 10 to -1 step -1</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print i</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_for</p>
			<p>Here, we will count down from <strong class="source-inline">10</strong> to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. Since we want the value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to be printed, we have set the stop value to <strong class="source-inline">-1</strong>. We can see the stop value as the first value that should not be part <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>of the range. Since we are decreasing the variable by <strong class="source-inline">1</strong>, the first value after <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> is <strong class="source-inline">-1</strong>. We have also changed the step to <strong class="source-inline">-1</strong>. This will <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>cause the variable to decrement by 1 each time.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, we don't know how many times we want to repeat something. We can use another type of <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, that is, the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop. Let's explore what that is.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Iteration with the while loop</h1>
			<p>Let's assume that we want to write a small dice-guessing game. The user will need to enter a guess between 1 and 6. The computer will then roll a dice and let the user know whether their guess was correct or not. The program will then allow the user to guess again, and again, and again. However, if the user <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>enters a value of 0 as their guess, we will let them exit the game. </p>
			<p>We have no way <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>of knowing how many times the user wants to play the game. They might give up after the first try or go on for hundreds of attempts (which is not that likely as this is a rather dull game, but you get the point).</p>
			<p>A <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop would not work that well for us here as we would need to say how many times the user would need to play before we let them out of the loop. Instead, another type of loop that is perfect for this scenario is the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop. This loop works on a condition instead of a count. If the condition is true, it will continue to loop.</p>
			<p>The structure looks like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">while condition</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_while</p>
			<p>If the condition is true, we will continue looping. This means that somewhere within the loop, the condition must be able to change or it will never get out of the loop.</p>
			<p>We will still need a variable to use in the condition. For example, we could use a Boolean variable for this. Recall that a Boolean variable only can hold the values of <strong class="source-inline">true</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and a condition is something that will be evaluated to either true or false. It can look like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">continue = true</p>
			<p class="source-code">while continue</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â some code that eventually sets continue to false</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_while</p>
			<p>Here, we declare a variable called <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> and set it to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop will look at the content of this variable, and, since it is <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, it will enter the loop.</p>
			<p>It will now <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>continue to loop as the variable has the value of <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. It is, therefore, vital that we, at some point inside the loop, assign a value of <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> to the variable so <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>that we can get out of the loop.</p>
			<p>Let's now build our guessing game using a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop:</p>
			<p class="source-code">continue = true</p>
			<p class="source-code">while continue</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "I will roll a dice. Guess the result(end with 0): "</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â input guess</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â dice = random(1, 6)</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â if guess == 0 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â continue = false</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â if guess == dice then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "Yes, you got it!"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "Sorry, better luck next time."</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â end_if</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â end_if</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_while</p>
			<p class="source-code">print "Thank you for playing this exciting game."</p>
			<p>Before going over the program and how it works, take a look at the following output from a potential game:</p>
			<p class="source-code">I will roll a dice. Guess the result(end with 0): 4</p>
			<p class="source-code">Sorry, better luck next time</p>
			<p class="source-code">I will roll a dice. Guess the result(end with 0): 2</p>
			<p class="source-code">Sorry, better luck next time</p>
			<p class="source-code">I will roll a dice. Guess the result(end with 0): 6</p>
			<p class="source-code">Yes, you got it!</p>
			<p class="source-code">I will roll a dice. Guess the result(end with 0): 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">Thank you for playing this exciting game.</p>
			<p>Looking at <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>the code, we can observe the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We can see <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>that we first create our variable that will keep track of when to stop looping. Since the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop runs if something is true, we set this variable to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>. If it is set to <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, we will not enter the loop and the game will be over before we even had a chance to play.</li>
				<li>Then comes the actual loop. Since the variable initially is set to <strong class="source-inline">true</strong>, we will enter the loop. </li>
				<li>The first thing that happens in the loop is that there is some text that provides instructions to the user. This is an excellent idea to let the user know how to exit the game.</li>
				<li>We then take the input from the user and store it in a variable called <strong class="source-inline">guess</strong>. </li>
				<li>Now it is time to roll a virtual dice. The <strong class="source-inline">random(1, 6)</strong> will give us a random number between 1 and 6. We store that random number in a variable named <strong class="source-inline">dice</strong>. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before we check <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>whether the user made a correct guess or not, we will examine whether the user has entered <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> to indicate that the game is over. The reason we do that before <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>we check whether the guess is correct or not is because if the user wants to end the game, we don't want to check their guess as we know 0 will indicate a wrong guess. We don't want to treat the input of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> as a guess.</p>
			<p>If <strong class="source-inline">guess</strong> is equal to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, we want to exit the loop. We do that by assigning <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> to the <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> variable.</p>
			<p>As the rest of the content of the loop is in an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> block, we will skip that if the input was <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. When we move to the line with <strong class="source-inline">while</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> will now be <strong class="source-inline">false</strong>, and we will exit the loop and print the thank you line at the end of the program.</p>
			<p>If the user has, instead, entered something other than <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, we will enter the first <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> block. </p>
			<p>The first line inside of this block is where we check whether the user made a correct guess. If the value we store in <strong class="source-inline">guess</strong> and the value that is in the <strong class="source-inline">dice</strong> variable is equal, we have a winner. </p>
			<p>If so, we will print a message congratulating the user. If not, we will let the user know that the guess was wrong.</p>
			<p>Looking at the code, we can see that the indentation of the code helps us to see which part belongs to which block. Note the block that starts with the following line:</p>
			<p class="source-code">if guess == dice then</p>
			<p>This can only be reached if the user did not enter a value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> since it is within an <strong class="source-inline">else</strong> block.</p>
			<p>As you can see, a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop is a handy feature. It has a sibling, the <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong> loop, which is almost identical to the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop but with a little twist. Let's examine that next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Iteration with the do while loop</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong> loop has the same features as the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop. <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong> works on a condition and can be used when we don't know how many iterations we will need to make.</p>
			<p>The difference from the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop is that where a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop might never execute because the condition could be <strong class="source-inline">false</strong> the first time we test it. In comparison, the <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong> loop is guaranteed to run at least once. The reason <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>for this is because the condition is <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>moved from the beginning of the loop to the end of it.</p>
			<p>This can be good for several reasons, and it can make our guessing game slightly less complicated. However, before we do that, we should look at what a <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong> loop looks like:</p>
			<p class="source-code">do</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â â€¦</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â some code that eventually sets the condition to false</p>
			<p class="source-code">while condition</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">do</strong> keyword marks the beginning of the loop. As you can see, there is nothing more on this line, so the program must run through the code inside the loop at least once to reach the condition at the very end.</p>
			<p>Just as with the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, we must have some code that somehow modifies the condition so that we can get out of the loop.</p>
			<p>One interesting aspect, when compared with the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, is that we don't need to create a variable outside the loop to hold a value that we can use for our condition. The reason for this is that, since we are checking the condition at the very end, we might be able to perform the condition check using a variable that we create inside the loop. To see this in action, let's modify our guessing game to use a <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong> loop. Take a look at the following snippet:</p>
			<p class="source-code">do</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "I will roll a dice. Guess the result(end with 0): "</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â input guess</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â dice = random(1, 6)</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â if guess != 0 then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â if guess == dice then</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "Yes, you got it!"</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â else</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print "Sorry, better luck next time."</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â end_if</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â Â end_if</p>
			<p class="source-code">while guess != 0</p>
			<p class="source-code">print "Thank you for playing this exciting game."</p>
			<p>The program is a bit shorter. This is because the <strong class="source-inline">continue</strong> variable is gone. If you look at the condition found on the penultimate line, you will see that we are using the <strong class="source-inline">guess</strong> variable directly to check <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>whether it is not <strong class="source-inline">0</strong> (remember that the <strong class="source-inline">!=</strong> operator means, does not equal to). This means if the user does not input <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, we will repeat.</p>
			<p>We have <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>also changed the <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement inside the loop. It now checks whether the <strong class="source-inline">guess</strong> variable is not equal to <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, and only if it is, we will treat it as a proper guess. </p>
			<p>If we have a sequence of things, such as an array, for example, it can be handy to go through that sequence one item at a time. We do have a loop for that too, which is the <strong class="source-inline">for each</strong> loop. Let's explore how that works next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Iterating over sequences using for each</h1>
			<p>When we <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>have a sequence of things, we often want to <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>go through it item by item. We can, of course, do that using a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">names = ["Anna", "Bob", "Carl", "Danielle"]</p>
			<p class="source-code">for i = 0 to names.length</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "Hi " + names[i]</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_for</p>
			<p>On the first line, we declare <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>an array of strings containing some names. We are using a variable called <strong class="source-inline">names</strong> to store the values.</p>
			<p>Then, we use a <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop, starting at <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. To find out how many times we will iterate, we ask the array how many items it currently has stored. We do that by using the <strong class="source-inline">names</strong> variable, and, by using a dot, we can get what is known as a property from the array. This property is a value that stores how many items the array currently has. The way we can ask a sequence how many items it has will differ from language to language, but it will most likely be something like what we have done. </p>
			<p>We need <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>to remember two things here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When using an index to retrieve a value from the array, we start at <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>. This means that we need to give our loop a start value of <strong class="source-inline">0</strong>, since <strong class="source-inline">Anna</strong> will be stored at that index.</li>
				<li>We need to make sure that the ending value is one that is greater than the last index in the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. Our array has four values, so when we ask it for its length, that is the value we get. However, when indexing into the array, we need to use the values of 0, 1, 2, and 3. This is four values, and the counting starts at 0, not 1. Since we know that the second value we give in the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop is the ending value, and it is the next value outside the range we want, then saying that we want to end at <strong class="source-inline">names.length</strong> ensures that we only get the values of 0, 1, 2, and 3.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Inside the loop, you can see that we are using the <strong class="source-inline">loop</strong> variable to index into the array. The first time, we will get <strong class="source-inline">Anna</strong>, the next time, we will get <strong class="source-inline">Bob</strong>, and so on.</p>
			<p>An easier and safer way to do this is by using something known as a <strong class="source-inline">for each</strong> loop. What this will do is it will go through a sequence and give us one of its items, one at a time. Taking the same previous code and using such a loop will now be like the following:</p>
			<p class="source-code">names = ["Anna", "Bob", "Carl", "Danielle"]</p>
			<p class="source-code">foreach name in names</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print "Hi " + name</p>
			<p class="source-code">end_foreach</p>
			<p>Now, this is <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>much nicer. We can read this as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>From the sequence names, give us the first item and store its value in the <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> variable.</li>
				<li>In the first iteration, <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> will contain <strong class="source-inline">Anna</strong>. The loop keeps track of where it is in the sequence. So, in the next iteration,Â Â <strong class="source-inline">name</strong> will be given the value of <strong class="source-inline">Bob</strong>.<p>Additionally, note that we don't need to keep track of how many things there are in the sequence, and we don't need to use any indexing, since indexing starts at 0 and not 1.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This kind of <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>loop gives us cleaner and more readable code that also reduces the risk of us inserting any errors into the code.</p>
			<p>We can use this loop to iterate over any sequence. As a string is a sequence of characters, using this loop on a string will give us each character that the string is made up of. Consider the following code example:</p>
			<p class="source-code">print "Please enter your name: "</p>
			<p class="source-code">input name</p>
			<p class="source-code">foreach character in name</p>
			<p class="source-code">Â Â Â Â print character</p>
			<p class="source-code">end foreach</p>
			<p>Here, we ask the user for a name and store the answer in a variable called <strong class="source-inline">name</strong>. We will then iterate through the variable, one character at the time. The current character will be stored in a variable called <strong class="source-inline">character</strong>. Inside the loop, we will just print that character.</p>
			<p>Running this program will give us an output like this:</p>
			<p class="source-code">Please enter your name: Charlotte</p>
			<p class="source-code">C</p>
			<p class="source-code">h</p>
			<p class="source-code">a</p>
			<p class="source-code">r</p>
			<p class="source-code">l</p>
			<p class="source-code">o</p>
			<p class="source-code">t</p>
			<p class="source-code">t</p>
			<p class="source-code">e</p>
			<p>We have looked at four different ways to make iterations and all of them have their different use cases. View them <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>as a set of tools that we have at our disposal and <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>can pick and use as needed. Add to that the tools for selection that we looked at earlier in this chapter and the toolset will keep improving!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Sequence, selection, and iteration are the three pillars that programming rests upon, and, in this chapter, we have covered the latter two.</p>
			<p>Selection is when we test values in variables using a condition that can be either true or false. If our test turns out to be true, we can let the program execute a block of code. If it turns out to be false, we can have another block that only runs if in the case. This is done with the help of <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statements. </p>
			<p>Sometimes, we have multiple options to choose from, and we need to pick one. We could then use a <strong class="source-inline">switch</strong> statement. Using it instead of an <strong class="source-inline">if</strong> statement can make your code less verbose and easier to read.</p>
			<p>The common task of repetition can be done in at least four ways, with the most common being the <strong class="source-inline">for</strong> loop. This loop will let us iterate a fixed number of times.</p>
			<p>When we don't know how many times we want to iterate, we can use either a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop or a <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong> loop. They will both iterate as long as a condition is true. This will let us write very flexible applications that might repeat something twice.</p>
			<p>The difference between the <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop and the <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong> loop is where the condition is located. In a <strong class="source-inline">while</strong> loop, it comes at the beginning, and, in a <strong class="source-inline">do while</strong>, it comes at the end. </p>
			<p>If we have a sequence of something, using a <strong class="source-inline">for each</strong> loop is the best choice, since it will go through the sequence and give us one of its objects at a time. It is a safe structure to use because it makes sure that we actually get all the values and don't miss out on the first or the last one.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will structure our code with the help of functions. They are a great way to make our code easier to read, understand, and maintain. They are also perfect for helping us to reuse the code that we have written.</p>

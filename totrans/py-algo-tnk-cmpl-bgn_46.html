<h3 id="toc_1">32.1 Introduction</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Since lists are handled with the same sequence, decision, and loop control structures that you learned about in previous chapters, there is no need to repeat all of that information here. However, what you will discover in this chapter is how to process each row or column of a two-dimensional list individually, how to solve problems that require the use of more than one list, how to create a two-dimensional list from a one-dimensional list (and vice versa), and some useful built-in list functions and methods that Python supports.</p>
<h3 id="toc_2">32.2 Processing Each Row Individually</h3>
<p class="my_basic">Processing each row individually means that every row is processed separately and the result of each row (which can be the sum, the average value, and so on) can be used individually for further processing.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Suppose you have the following 4 × 5 list.</p>
<p class="centered_image">.<img alt="Image" class="width19" src="img/chapter32-01.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's try to find the sum of each row individually. Both of the following approaches iterate through rows.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Creating an auxiliary list</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, the program processes each row individually and creates an auxiliary list in which each element stores the sum of one row. This approach gives you much flexibility since you can use this new list later in your program for further processing. The auxiliary list total is shown on the right.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width29" src="img/chapter32-02.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's write the corresponding code fragment. To more easily understand the process, the “from inner to outer” method is used. The following code fragment calculates the sum of the first row (row index 0) and stores the result in the element at position 0 of the auxiliary list total. Assume variable i contains the value 0.</p>
<div><p>s = 0</p>
<p>for j in range(COLUMNS):</p>
<p>s += b[i][j]</p>
<p>total[i] = s</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">This code fragment can equivalently be written as</p>
<div><p>total[i] = 0</p>
<p>for j in range(COLUMNS):</p>
<p>total[i] += b[i][j]</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, nesting this code fragment in a for-loop that iterates for all rows results in the following.</p>
<div><p>total = [None] * ROWS</p>
<p>for i in range(ROWS):</p>
<p>total[i] = 0</p>
<p>for j in range(COLUMNS):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>total[i] += b[i][j]</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The same result, however, can be achieved using the magic forces of Python! The code fragment is as follows.</p>
<div><p>total = []</p>
<p>for row in b:</p>
<p>total.append(fsum(row))</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Just find it and process it.</p>
<p class="my_basic">This approach uses no auxiliary list; it just calculates and directly processes the sum. The code fragment is as follows.</p>
<div><p>for i in range(ROWS):</p>
<p>total = 0</p>
<p>for j in range(COLUMNS):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>total += b[i][j]</p></blockquote></div>
<div><p>process total</p></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">What does process total mean? It depends on the given problem. It may just display the sum, it may calculate the average value of each individual row and display it, or it may use the sum for calculating even more complex mathematical expressions.</p>
<p class="my_basic">For instance, the following example calculates and displays the average value of each row of list b.</p>
<div><p>for i in range(ROWS):</p>
<p>total = 0</p>
<p>for j in range(COLUMNS):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>total += b[i][j]</p></blockquote></div>
<p>average = total / COLUMNS</p>
<p>print(average)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The same result, however, can be achieved using the magic forces of Python! The code fragment is as follows</p>
<div><p>for row in b:</p>
<p>total = fsum(row)</p>
<p>print(total / COLUMNS)</p>
</div>

<h3 id="toc_6">32.4 How to Use More Than One Data Structures in a Program</h3>
<p class="my_basic">So far, every example or exercise has used just one list or one dictionary. But what if a problem requires you to use two lists, or one list and one dictionary, or one list and two dictionaries? Next you will find some exercises that show you how various data structures can be combined to tackle a variety of unique challenges.</p>
<h4 id="toc_7">Exercise 32.4-1 Using Three One-Dimensional Lists</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">There are 20 students and each one of them has received grades for two lessons. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the name and grades of each student for both lessons. The program must then find and display the names of all students who have grades greater than 89 for both lessons.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Following are the required lists containing some typical values.</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width40" src="img/chapter32-07.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">As you can see, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in the list names and those in the lists gradesLesson1, and gradesLesson2. The first of the twenty students is George, and he received grades of 95 and 92 for the two lessons. The name “George” is stored at index 0 of the list names, and at exactly the same index in the lists gradesLesson1 and gradesLesson2, his grades for the two lessons are stored. The next student (Anna) and her grades are stored at index 1 of the lists names, gradesLesson1, and gradesLesson2, respectively, and so on.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_32.4-1</div>

<h4 id="toc_8">Exercise 32.4-2 Using a One-Dimensional List Along with a Two-Dimensional List</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">There are 10 students and each one of them has received their grades for five lessons. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the name of each student and the grades for all lessons and then calculates and displays the names of the students who have more than one grade greater than 89.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, you could do what you did in the previous one. You could, for example, use a one-dimensional list to store the names of the students and five one-dimensional lists to store the grades for each student for each lesson. Not very convenient, but it could work. Obviously, when there are more than two grades, this is not the most suitable approach.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The best approach here is to use a one-dimensional list to store the names of the students and a two-dimensional list to store the grades for each student for each lesson.</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are actually two approaches. Which one to use depends clearly on you! If you decide that, in the two-dimensional list, the rows should refer to students and the columns should refer to lessons then you can use the first approach discussed below. If you decide that the rows should refer to lessons and the columns should refer to students then you can use the second approach that follows.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Rows for students, columns for lessons</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, the two-dimensional list must have 10 rows, one for every student and 5 columns, one for every lesson. All other lists can be placed in relation to this two-dimensional list as follows.</p>

<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The auxiliary list count will be created by the program and will store the number of grades for each student that are greater than 89.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Now, let's see how to read values and store them in the lists names and grades. One simple solution would be to use one for-loop for reading names, and then nested for-loops for reading grades. However, it may not be very practical for the user to first enter all names and then all grades. A more user-friendly approach would be to prompt the user to enter one student name and then all of their grades, then proceed to the next student name and their corresponding grades, and so on. The solution is as follows.</p>

<p>2)On Earth, a free-falling object has an acceleration of 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> downward. This value is denoted by g. A student wants to calculate that value using an experiment. She allows five different objects to fall downward from a known height and measures the time they need to reach the floor. She does this 10 times for each object. Then, using a formula she calculates g for each object, for each fall. But since her chronometer is not so accurate, she needs a Python program that lets her enter all calculated values of g in a 5 × 10 list and then, it calculates and displays</p>
<p>a)for each object, the average value of g</p>
<p>b)for each fall, the average value of g</p>
<p>c)the overall average value of g</p>
<p>3)A basketball team with 15 players plays 12 matches. Write a Python program that lets the user enter, for each player, the number of points scored in each match. The program must then display</p>
<p>a)for each player, the total number of points scored</p>
<p>b)for each match, the total number of points scored</p>
<p>4)Write a Python program that lets the user enter the hourly measured temperatures of 20 cities for a period of one day, and then displays the hours in which the average temperature of all the cities was below 10 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>5)In a football tournament, a football team with 24 players plays 10 matches. Write a Python program that lets the user enter, for each player, a name as well as the number of goals they scored in each match. The program must then display</p>
<p>a)for each player, his name and the average number of goals he scored</p>
<p>b)for each match, the index number of the match (1, 2, 3, and so on) and the total number of goals scored</p>
<p>6)There are 12 students and each one of them has received their grades for six lessons. Write a Python program that lets the user enter the name of the student as well as their grades in all lessons and then displays</p>
<p>a)for each student, their name and average grade</p>
<p>b)for each lesson, the average grade</p>
<p>c)the names of the students who have an average grade less than 60</p>
<p>d)the names of the students who have an average grade greater than 89, and the message “Bravo!” next to it</p>

<p>7)In a song contest, each artist sings a song of their choice. There are five judges and 15 artists, each of whom is scored for their performance. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter the names of the judges, the names of the artists, the title of the song that each artist sings, and the score they get from each judge. The program must then display</p>
<p>a)for each artist, their name, the title of the song, and their total score</p>
<p>b)for each judge, their name and the average value of the score they gave</p>
<p>8)The Body Mass Index (BMI) is often used to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight for their height. The formula used to calculate BMI is</p>

<p>a)for each person, their average weight, average height, and average BMI</p>
<p>b)for each person, their BMI in May and in August</p>
<p class="my_basic ptab1 KBHeading">Please note that all people are adults but some of them are between the ages of 18 and 25. This means they may still grow taller, thus their height might be different each month!</p>
<p>9)Write a Python program that lets the user enter the electric meter reading in kilowatt-hours (kWh) at the beginning and at the end of a month for 1000 consumers. The program must then calculate and display</p>
<p>a)for each consumer, the amount of kWh consumed and the amount of money that must be paid given a cost of each kWh of $0.07 and a value added tax (VAT) rate of 19%</p>
<p>b)the total consumption and the total amount of money that must be paid.</p>
<p>10)Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter an amount in US dollars and calculates and displays the corresponding currency value in Euros, British Pounds Sterling, Australian Dollars, and Canadian Dollars. The tables below contain the exchange rates for each currency for a period of five working days. The program must calculate the average value of each currency and do the conversions based on that average value.</p>

<p>11)Gross pay depends on the pay rate and the total number of hours worked per week. However, if someone works more than 40 hours, they get paid time-and-a-half for all hours worked over 40. Write a Python program that lets the user enter a pay rate, as well as the names of 10 employees and the number of hours that they worked each day (Monday to Friday). The program must then calculate and display</p>
<p>a)the names of employees who worked overtime</p>
<p>b)for each employee, their name and the average daily gross pay</p>
<p>c)the total gross pay for all employees</p>
<p>d)for each employee, their name, the name of the day they worked overtime (more than 8 hours), and the message “Overtime!”</p>
<p>e)for each day, the name of the day and the total gross pay</p>
<p>12)Write a Python program to create a one-dimensional list of 12 elements from the two-dimensional list shown below, as follows: the first row of the two-dimensional list must be placed in the first four positions of the one-dimensional list, the second row of the two-dimensional list must be placed in the next four positions of the one-dimensional list, and the last row of the two-dimensional list must be placed in the last four positions of the one-dimensional list.</p>

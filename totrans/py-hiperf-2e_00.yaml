- en: The Python programming language has seen a huge surge in popularity in recent
    years, thanks to its intuitive, fun syntax, and its vast array of top-quality
    third-party libraries. Python has been the language of choice for many introductory
    and advanced university courses as well as for numerically intense fields, such
    as the sciences and engineering. Its primary applications also lies in machine
    learning, system scripting, and web applications.

- en: The reference Python interpreter, CPython, is generally regarded as inefficient
    when compared to lower-level languages, such as C, C++, and Fortran. CPython’s
    poor performance lies in the fact that the program instructions are processed
    by an interpreter rather than being compiled to efficient machine code. While
    using an interpreter has several advantages, such as portability and the additional
    compilation step, it does introduce an extra layer of indirection between the
    program and the machine, which causes a less efficient execution.

    shortcomings. This book aims to fill this gap and will teach how to consistently
    achieve strong performance out of your Python programs.

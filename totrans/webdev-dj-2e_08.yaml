- en: This chapter starts by introducing you to media files and then teaching you
    how to set up Django to serve them. Once you have understood this, you will learn
    how to build a form in HTML that can upload files to a view for storage to disk.
    To enhance this process and reduce the amount of code, you will use Django forms
    to generate and validate a form and learn how to process file uploads through
    it. You will then look at some enhancements that Django provides specifically
    for working with image files and use the `FileField` and `ImageField` to store
    a file and image respectively and upload to it using a Django form. After this,
    you will build a `ModelForm` instance automatically from the model and save the
    model and the files using just one line of code. At the end of this chapter, you
    will enhance the Bookr app by adding a cover image and book excerpt to the `Book`
    model.

- en: Media files refer to extra files that can be added after deployment to enrich
    your Django application. Usually, they are extra images that you would use in
    your site, but any type of file (including video, audio, PDF, text, documents,
    or even HTML) can be served as media.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can think of them as somewhere between dynamic data and static assets. They
    are not dynamic data that Django generates on the fly, like when rendering a template.
    They also are not the static files that are included by the site developer when
    the site is deployed. Instead, they are extra files that can be uploaded by users
    or generated by your application for later retrieval.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some common examples of media files (that you will see in *Activity 8.01*, *Image
    and PDF Uploads of Books*, later in this chapter) are book covers and preview
    PDFs that can be attached to a `Book` object. You can also use media files to
    allow users to upload images for a blog post or avatars for a social media site.
    If you wanted to use Django to build your own video sharing platform, you would
    store the uploaded videos as media. Your website will not function well if all
    these files are static files, as users won't be able to upload their own book
    covers, videos, and so on, and will be stuck with the ones you deployed.

    to serve static files. Serving media files is quite similar. Two settings must
    be configured in `settings.py`: `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL`. These are analogous
    to `STATIC_ROOT` and `STATIC_URL` for serving static files.'

    or CSS files) with malicious code and exploit your users.

- en: As with static files, when serving media in production, your web server should
    be configured to serve directly from the `MEDIA_ROOT` directory to prevent Django
    from being tied up servicing the request. The Django dev server can serve media
    files in development. However, unlike static files, the URL mapping and view is
    not set up automatically for media files.

    appending the map is so we don't add this map in production.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `static` URL map does not work when the Django `DEBUG` setting is `False`,
    and so it can't be used in production. However, as mentioned earlier, in production
    your web server should be serving these requests, so Django will not need to handle
    them.

    to upload, Django also includes an `ImageField` instance. This behaves similarly
    to `FileField` instance but also automatically validates that the data is an image
    file. This helps mitigate security issues where we expect an image, but the user
    uploads a malicious file.

    as its `width`, `height`, and `format`) but you can't access the actual image

- en: Throughout this chapter and *Chapter 5*, *Serving Static Files*, we have discouraged
    serving files using Django. This is because it would needlessly tie up a Python
    process just serving a file – something that the web server is capable of handling.
    Unfortunately, web servers do not usually provide dynamic access control, that
    is, allowing only authenticated users to download a file. Depending on your web
    server used in production, you might be able to have it authenticate against Django
    and then serve the file itself; however, the specific configuration of specific
    web servers is outside the scope of this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One approach you can take is to specify a subdirectory of your `MEDIA_ROOT`
    directory and have your web server prevent access to just this specific folder.
    Any protected media should be stored inside it. If you do this, only Django will
    be able to read the files inside. For example, your web server could serve everything
    in the `MEDIA_ROOT` directory, except for a `MEDIA_ROOT/protected` directory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another approach would be to configure a Django view to serve a specific file
    from disk. The view will determine the path of the file on disk to send, then
    send it using the `FileResponse` class. The `FileResponse` class takes an open
    filehandle as an argument and tries to determine the correct content type from
    the file's content. Django will close the filehandle after the request completes.

- en: When you access a `FileField` or `ImageField` attribute of a model instance,
    you will not get a native Python `file` object. Instead, you will be working with
    a `FieldFile` object. The `FieldFile` class is a wrapper around a `file` that
    adds extra methods. Yes, it can be confusing to have classes called `FileField`
    and `FieldFile`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason that Django uses `FieldFile` instead of just a `file` object is twofold.
    First, it adds extra methods to open, read, delete, and generate the URL of the
    file. Second, it provides an abstraction to allow alternative storage engines
    to be used.

    Files*, for static files also applies to media files. The important thing to note
    is that the storage engine you are using can be changed without updating your
    other code. This means that you can have your media files stored on your local
    drive during development and then saved to a CDN when your application is deployed
    to production.

- en: In this chapter, we added the `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` settings and a special
    URL map to serve media files. We then created a form and a view to upload files
    and save them to the `media` directory. We saw how to add the media context processor
    to automatically have access to the `MEDIA_URL` setting in all our templates.
    We then enhanced and simplified our form code by using a Django form with a `FileField`
    or `ImageField`, instead of manually defining one in HTML.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We looked at some of the enhancements Django provides for images with the `ImageField`,
    and how to interact with an image using Pillow. We showed an example view that
    would be able to serve files that required authentication, using the `FileResponse`
    class. Then, we saw how to store files on models using the `FileField` and `ImageField`
    and refer to them in a template using the `FileField.url` attribute. We were able
    to reduce the amount of code we had to write by automatically building a `ModelForm`
    from a `model` instance. Finally, in the two activities at the end, we enhanced
    Bookr by adding a cover image and sample file to the `Book` model. In *Chapter
    9*, *Sessions and Authentication*, we will learn how to add authentication to
    a Django application to protect it from unauthorized users.

Thanks to the impressive amount of high-quality third-party libraries, Python is used in many domains.</p><p>Low-level languages such as C, C++, and Fortran are usually preferred in performance-critical applications. Programs written in those languages perform extremely well, but are hard to write and maintain.</p><p>Python is an easier language to deal with and it can be used to quickly write complex applications. Thanks to its tight integration with C, Python is able to avoid the performance drop associated with dynamic languages. You can use blazing fast C extensions for performance-critical code and retain all the convenience of Python for the rest of your application.</p><p>In this book, you will learn, in a step-by-step method how to find and speedup the slow parts of your programs using basic and advanced techniques.</p><p>The style of the book is practical; every concept is explained and illustrated with examples. This book also addresses common mistakes and teaches how to avoid them. The tools used in this book are quite popular and battle-tested; you can be sure that they will stay relevant and well-supported in the future.</p><p>This book starts from the basics and builds on them, therefore, I suggest you to move through the chapters in order.</p><p>And don't forget to have fun!</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Benchmarking and Profiling">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Benchmarking and Profiling</em></span> shows you how to find the parts of your program that need optimization. We will use tools for different use cases and explain how to analyze and interpret profiling statistics.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Fast Array Operations with NumPy">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Fast Array Operations with NumPy</em></span> is a guide to the NumPy package. NumPy is a framework for array calculations in Python. It comes with a clean and concise API, and efficient array operations.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. C Performance with Cython">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>C Performance with Cython</em></span> is a tutorial on Cython: a language that acts as a bridge between Python and C. Cython can be used to write code using a superset of the Python syntax and to compile it to obtain efficient C extensions.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Parallel Processing">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Parallel Processing</em></span> is an introduction to parallel programming. In this chapter, you will learn how parallel programming is different from serial programming and how to parallelize simple problems. We will also explain how to use multiprocessing, <code class="literal">IPython.parallel</code> and <code class="literal">cython.parallel</code> to write code for multiple cores.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>This book requires a Python installation. The examples work for both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 unless indicated otherwise.</p><p>In this book, we will make use of some popular Python packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>NumPy</strong></span> (Version 1.7.1 or later): This package is downloadable from the official website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)">http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)</a> and available in most of the Linux distributions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Cython</strong></span> (Version 0.19.1 or later): Installation instructions are present in the official website (<a class="ulink" href="http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/install.html">http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/install.html</a>); notice that you also need a C compiler, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), to compile your C extensions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>IPython</strong></span> (Version 0.13.2 or later): Installation instructions are present in the official website (<a class="ulink" href="http://ipython.org/install.html">http://ipython.org/install.html</a>)</li></ul></div><p>The book was written and tested on Ubuntu 13.10. The examples will likely run on Mac OS X with little or no changes.</p><p>My suggestion for Windows users is to install the Anaconda Python distribution (<a class="ulink" href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/</a>), which comes with a complete environment suitable for scientific programming.</p><p>A convenient alternative is to use the free service <code class="literal">wakari.io</code>: a cloud-based Linux and Python environment that includes the required packages with their tools and utilities. No setup is required.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Benchmarking and Profiling">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Benchmarking and Profiling</em></span>, we will use KCachegrind (<a class="ulink" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kcachegrind/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/kcachegrind/</a>), which is available for Linux. KCachegrind has also a port for Windows—QcacheGrind—which is also installable from source on Mac OS X.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for intermediate to advanced Python programmers who develop performance-critical applications. As most of the examples are taken from scientific applications, the book is a perfect match for scientists and engineers looking to speed up their numerical codes.</p><p>However, the scope of this book is broad and the concepts can be applied to any domain. Since the book addresses both basic and advanced topics, it contains useful information for programmers with different Python proficiency levels.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The <code class="literal">plot</code> function included in <code class="literal">matplotlib</code> can display our particles as points on a Cartesian grid and the <code class="literal">FuncAnimation</code> class can animate the evolution of our particles over time."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def visualize(simulator):

    X = [p.x for p in simulator.particles]
    Y = [p.y for p in simulator.particles]</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">In [1]: import purepy

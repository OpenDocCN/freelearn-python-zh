- en: In today's world of desktop applications, there is a great amount of incentive
    to be able to develop applications that can run in more than one environment.
    Currently, there are a handful of options available for cross-platform frameworks
    to develop desktop applications in Python. wxPython is one such cross-platform
    GUI toolkit for the Python programming language. It allows Python programmers
    to create programs with a complete, highly-functional graphical user interface,
    simply and easily. wxPython code style has changed quite a bit over the years,
    and has become much more Pythonic. The examples that you will find in this book
    are fully up-to-date and reflect this change in style. This cookbook provides
    you with the latest recipes to quickly create robust, reliable, and reusable wxPython
    applications. These recipes will guide you from writing simple, basic wxPython
    scripts all the way through complex concepts, and also feature various design
    approaches and techniques in wxPython.

- en: This book starts off by covering a variety of topics, from the most basic requirements
    of a wxPython application, to some of the more in-depth details of the inner workings
    of the framework, laying the foundation for any wxPython application. It then
    explains event handling, basic and advanced user interface controls, interface
    design and layout, creating dialogs, components, extending functionality, and
    so on. We conclude by learning how to build and manage applications for distribution.

    examples, along with plenty of example code that shows how to develop and manage
    user-friendly applications. For more experienced developers, most recipes also
    include an additional discussion of the solution, allowing you to further customize
    and enhance the component.

    Started with wxPython*, introduces you to the basics of creating a wxPython application.
    The topics covered in this chapter will provide you with the information needed
    to start building your own applications, as well as some insight into the inner
    workings and structure of the framework.'

    shows how to make use of events to drive an application and allow the user to
    interact with it through the user interface. This chapter starts with an overview
    of what events are and how they work, and then continues on to cover how to interact
    with a number of common events.'

    *Basic Building Blocks of a User Interface*, discusses a number of the basic widgets
    that are critical to the creation of nearly all user interfaces. You will be introduced
    to the usage of widgets such as Buttons, Menus, and ToolBars in this chapter.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Advanced Building Blocks of a User Interface"),
    *Advanced Building Blocks of a User Interface*, introduces you to some of the
    more advanced widgets available in the wxPython control library. These widgets
    will allow you to create tabbed interfaces and display more complex types of data
    in your user interface.'

    *Providing Information and Alerting Users*, shows multiple techniques for keeping
    the users of an application informed about what is going on and to provide them
    with help on interacting with the various controls in the applications interface.
    This chapter will show you how to use various tooltip controls, message boxes,
    and splash screens.'

    Information from Users*, covers the use of common dialogs to retrieve information
    from users in order to perform tasks such as opening files, searching text, and
    even printing. As a part of the recipes for the usage of `FileDialog` and `FindDialogs`
    you will create a simple Notepad-like application.'

    and Design*, is where you will be introduced to a number of concepts and techniques
    for designing your user interfaces in wxPython. The majority of this chapter will
    explain the use of Sizers to allow you to quickly implement cross-platform user
    interfaces.'

    user interface objects. This chapter will show you how to use Device Contexts
    to perform custom drawing routines by creating a number of custom display controls.'

    chapter will provide you with an understanding of some strong approaches and techniques
    to software design that will not only serve you in writing wxPython applications
    but can also be generally applied to other frameworks as well, to expand your
    programming toolbox.'

    your own controls. The recipes in this chapter combine much of the information
    presented in Chapters 2, 7, 8, and 9 together to create new controls and to enhance
    the capabilities of some of the more basic ones provided by wxPython.'

    provide a shameless plug for my own application, Editra, here since it is included
    in the wxPython Docs and Demo package, as well as at [http://editra.org](http://editra.org).
    It is written in wxPython and provides good syntax highlighting and auto-completion
    support for Python that will help you in learning the wxPython API.

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">A fundamental thread of computer science is computer architecture. This topic was once called computer hardware and is concerned with the physical computer itself; that is, the <strong class="bold">central processing unit</strong> (<strong class="bold">CPU</strong>), memory, buses, and peripherals. Computer hardware contrasts with computer software, which applies to the programs, applications, and operating systems that computers execute.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">Most users are no more concerned with computer hardware and architecture than drivers worry about the operation of their vehicles’ carburetors. However, a knowledge of computer architecture is useful in many ways, ranging from how efficiently you operate your computer to maximizing its security. A good analogy is with pilots. They learn how to fly an aircraft, and a knowledge of how its engines operate is considered absolutely vital in handling abnormal situations, prolonging the engine life, and minimizing fuel consumption.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">Computer architecture is a large subject and is broadly divided into three interrelated areas: <code>add P,A,B</code>, which adds A to B and puts the sum in P. This book explains computer architecture by demonstrating how you can write a program that simulates a computer.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">The part of computer science that deals with how a computer implements the actions of its architecture is called computer organization and is largely beyond the scope of this text. Computer organization is concerned with the gates and circuits of the computer.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">An author can’t do justice to all the aspects of a computer in one book. Here, I am interested in tackling one topic: the ISA. I am going to introduce the computer’s instruction set and explain what it does. I will also discuss different types of instruction sets; for example, the ARM processor found in most mobile phones is very different from the Intel and AMD processors at the heart of PCs and laptops. In the second part of this book, we will concentrate on a specific computer and look at a real-world architecture, the ARM processor.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">This book is different. There are books on computer architecture. There are books on Python. There are books on the Raspberry Pi computer. Here, we combine all three of these topics. However, I don’t do this in a superficial way leaving the reader with a shallow and unsatisfactory knowledge of each topic.</p>&#13;
			<p class="_idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">My intention is to introduce a computer architecture and its instruction set. That is, I am going to explain how a computer works at the level of its native instructions (called assembly language). I describe what an instruction does and how it is read, interpreted (i.e., decoded), and then executed (implemented). I will also discuss the type of operations computers implement.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">So, how does Python fit into this scheme? Python is a popular high-level programming language that is freely available for use on the PC, Apple Mac, and Raspberry Pi. Moreover, Python is probably the easiest computer language to learn, and it is remarkably powerful.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">People learn by doing. I have decided to include sufficient Python for the reader to construct a simple computer simulator that can read a machine-level computer instruction and execute it. Because I will show how this Python simulator works, students can build computers to their own specifications. They can experiment with instruction sets, addressing modes, instruction formats, and so on. They can even build different types of computers to their own specifications, for example, by using <strong class="bold">complex instruction set computer</strong> (<strong class="bold">CISC</strong>) or <strong class="bold">reduced instruction set computer</strong> (<strong class="bold">RISC</strong>) architectures. CISC and RISC offer two different philosophies of computer design. Essentially, RISC computers have fixed-length instructions that permit only register load and store memory operations, whereas CISC computers can have variable-length instructions and permit direct data operations on memory. In reality, the distinction between RISC and CISC is more complex. The first generation of microprocesses all conformed to CISC philosophy.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">Readers can build computers because they can write a program in Python that will execute the target language of a specific computer architecture and they can design that target language themselves.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">One of the most popular computer architectures is the ARM processor found in countless mobile applications and even Apple laptops. Not only is this an economically dominant processor family but it’s also very popular in education because of its interesting and innovative architecture and its relatively gentle learning curve. Even better, this is the processor used by the low-cost Raspberry Pi computer. You can run ARM code on Raspberry Pi using software tools that come with the computer. You can also run Python programs on Raspberry Pi with free software. Consequently, Raspberry Pi provides students with an excellent low-cost machine that lets them study core hardware topics with no further investment in hardware or software.</p>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">For many years, I have taught computer architecture and have used simulators to teach assembly language. This approach demonstrates what instructions do but not how they do it or how they are designed, decoded, and executed. I decided to create a simple instruction simulator for class use. This book evolved from that project.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">My target audience can be divided into four main groups, as follows:</p>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB">Students who are taking a computer architecture course and would like to enhance their experience of computer architecture by experimenting with their own CPUs by means of simulation. This approach would increase the depth of their knowledge of computer architecture and enhance their understanding of the trade-offs that the computer designer faces.</li>&#13;
				<li class="_idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB">The non-computer specialist, the layperson, and the enthusiast who would like to know how computers work. By using Python as the design language and providing an introductory course on Python, I have attempted to make the book accessible to those with little or no experience in programming.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB">The Raspberry Pi user. Raspberry Pi has had an immense impact on computer science education. This book provides a brief introduction to Raspberry Pi and shows how it is possible to write assembly language programs in the ARM’s native language. Moreover, Raspberry Pi also provides an environment (Python and its tools) that allows the reader to understand and simulate computers.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB">The reader wanting to learn Python. Although this is not a formal course on Python, it provides a goal-oriented introduction to Python; that is, it applies Python to an actual example. This approach avoids the breadth of a conventional course and enables the reader to construct a practical application with a relatively shallow learning curve.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB">I have not assumed that a beginner reader has absolutely no knowledge of computers at all. This book assumes a very basic knowledge of binary arithmetic and number bases and the basic concepts of Boolean variables.</li>&#13;
			</ul>&#13;
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>&#13;
			<ul>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a><em class="italic">, From Finite State Machines to the Computers,</em> introduces the notion of digital computers via the finite state machine that is used to model simple control systems. From there, we introduce the concept of algorithms and programs. Once we know what we want a computer to do, we can think about what we need to implement a computer.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, High-Speed Introduction to Python,</em> provides the initial background in Python that is required to take the first steps on the way to implementing a computer using Python.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor042"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">, Data Flow in a Computer, </em>demonstrates how information flows around a computer during the execution of a program. It is this data flow that we have to implement when we are simulating a program in software.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">, Crafting an Interpreter – First Steps,</em> begins the journey to a simulator. Now that we have been introduced to the concept of a computer and a little Python, we can go further and describe the fundamental ideas behind a computer simulator. In this chapter, we also look at the nature of computer instructions.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor075"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, A Little More Python,</em> expands our knowledge of Python and introduces us to vital topics such as Python’s dictionaries, which provide tools that greatly simplify the design of a computer simulator.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor091"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, TC1 Assembler and Simulator Design,</em> is the heart of this book. Here, we discuss the components of a simulator and then provide a program that can simulate a hypothetical teaching computer, TC1.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">, Extending the TC1, </em>adds further facilities to the simulator, such as data checking and creating new instructions.</li>&#13;
				<li class="_idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor135"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a><em class="italic">, Simulators for Other Architectures,</em> looks at different types of computer architecture and describes alternative simulators.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor159"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a><em class="italic">, Raspberry Pi – An Introduction,</em> changes course. Here, we look at the popular Raspberry Pi and the ARM processor at its core. In particular, we learn how to enter a program in ARM assembly language and run it in debugging mode.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a><em class="italic">, A Closer Look at the ARM,</em> examines ARM’s instruction set in greater detail and provides a foundation for writing programs in assembly language.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor197"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a><em class="italic">, ARM Addressing Modes,</em> looks at the addressing modes of the ARM in greater detail and explains some of its special features.</li>&#13;
				<li lang="en-GB"><a href="B19624_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor209"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a><em class="italic">, Subroutines and the Stack,</em> is really an extension of the previous chapter because we look at the way in which the ARM uses its addressing modes to implement stack operations, which are so important in assembly language programming.</li>&#13;

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">This book is split into two parts. The first part develops a computer simulator in Python and the second part provides a brief introduction to Raspberry Pi and uses it as a vehicle to teach ARM assembly language programming.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">I used a PC with Windows to develop the Python programs. The reader may use a Windows-based system, an Apple Mac, or any Linux-based computer to develop Python. All the necessary software is freely available.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">You can, of course, use Raspberry Pi itself to develop Python.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">In order to write ARM assembly language programs and debug them, you need a Raspberry Pi. This is a single-board computer and requires a power supply, keyboard, mouse, and monitor. I have used both the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ and Raspberry Pi 4 Model B versions.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">The software required to develop Python programs is freely available from <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a>. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer is not sold with an operating system. You must either buy an SD card with the operating system installed or download it yourself. Details are given at https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html.</p>&#13;
			<p class="_idGenParaOverride-1" lang="en-GB"><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting </strong><strong class="bold">of code.</strong></p>&#13;

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Conventions used</h1>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB"><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates that words in text are not plain English words, but are words belonging to a program.</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">The <code>break</code> instruction breaks out of the <code>while</code> loop (that is, execution continues beyond the end of the loop - it’s a sort of short-circuit mechanism). </p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">In order to draw your attention to features in code, we sometimes use bold font or shading to highlight features. Consider the following example:</p>&#13;
			<p lang="en-GB">The text following # is in a non-monospaced font and is a comment ignored by the computer: </p>&#13;
			<pre class="source-code" lang="en-GB">&#13;
for i in range (0,6):         # Repeat six times </pre>&#13;

It is largely used for testing applications, but its usages are not limited only to testing. It can also be used for screen scraping and automating repetitive tasks in a browser window. Selenium supports automation on all the major browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera. Selenium WebDriver is now a part of W3C standards and is supported by major browser vendors.</p><p>Selenium offers the following set of tools for automating interaction with browsers:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Selenium IDE</strong>: This is a Firefox add-in used to record and play back the Selenium scripts with Firefox. It provides a graphical user interface to record user actions using Firefox. It is a great tool to start learning and using Selenium, but it can only be used with Firefox and other browsers are not supported. However, it can convert the recorded scripts into various programming languages supported by Selenium WebDriver, which supports running scripts on browsers other than Firefox.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Selenium WebDriver</strong>: This is a programming interface for developing advanced Selenium scripts using programming languages. We can also run tests on multiple browsers that are supported by Selenium on multiple operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. This makes Selenium a true cross-browser testing tool. Selenium WebDriver offers client libraries in various languages, including Java, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript, and are more into writing test scripts.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Selenium standalone server</strong>: This is also known as Selenium Grid and allows remote and distributed execution of Selenium scripts created with WebDriver. We can also use the grid feature of the standalone server to run tests in parallel, including tests on mobile platforms such as Android or Apple iOS for iPhone and iPad.</li></ul></div><p>As the title suggests, this book will introduce you to the Selenium WebDriver client library for Python. You will learn how to use Selenium WebDriver in Python to automate browsers for testing web applications. This book contains lessons right from setting up Selenium to using the basic and advanced features of Selenium to create and run automated scripts for testing web applications. This book assumes you have a basic idea of programming using Python.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Selenium WebDriver and Python">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with Selenium WebDriver and Python</em>, starts with installing Python and the Selenium WebDriver client library. We will select a Python editor or IDE for Selenium script development. We will then create our first automation script for a simple search workflow from the application under test. At the end of this chapter, we will run the Selenium script on various browsers supported by Selenium.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Writing Tests Using unittest">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Writing Tests Using unittest</em>, shows you how to use Selenium and the unittest library to test web applications. We will convert the script into a unittest test case. We will create few more tests using Selenium and unittest. We will create a TestSuite for a group of tests. We will run these tests and analyze the results. At the end of this chapter, you will learn how to produce test reports in the HTML format that you can distribute to various stakeholders of the project.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Finding Elements">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Finding Elements</em>, introduces you to locators that are the keys to automate different types of User Interface (UI) elements displayed on the web pages in the browser window. Selenium uses locators to find elements on a page and then performs actions or retrieves their properties for testing. You will learn various methods to locate elements, including XPath and CSS. We will show you how to use these methods with examples on the application under test.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using the Selenium Python API for Element Interaction">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Using the Selenium Python API for Element Interaction</em>, shows you how to use the Selenium WebDriver client library to interact with different types of elements, JavaScript alerts, frames, and windows in Python. You will learn how to perform actions such as sending values to elements, performing clicks, and selecting options from dropdowns. You will also see how to handle frames, different types of JavaScript alerts, and switch between child browser windows.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Synchronizing Tests">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Synchronizing Tests</em>, introduces you to various wait methods provided by Selenium to synchronize tests for reliable and robust execution. You will learn how to use the implicit and explicit wait to implement synchronization in Selenium tests. You will learn various methods to implement explicit wait in our test scripts.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Cross-browser Testing">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Cross-browser Testing</em>, dives into using RemoteWebDriver to run cross-browser tests on remote machines or through the Selenium Grid. You will learn how to use RemoteWebDriver to run tests on remote machines. We will also set up a Selenium Grid to run tests on various combinations of browsers and operating systems. You will also see how to execute tests on headless browsers such as PhantomJS. At the end of the chapter, we will see how to use cloud testing tools such as Sauce Labs and BrowserStack to run tests in cloud using RemoteWebDriver.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Testing on Mobile">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Testing on Mobile</em>, shows you how to test applications on mobile devices using Selenium WebDriver and Appium. We will set up Appium to test our sample application on iOS and on an Android emulator and device. You will also learn how to run native mobile applications using Appium.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Page Objects and Data-driven Testing">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Page Objects and Data-driven Testing</em>, introduces you to two important design patterns to implement a maintainable and efficient testing framework. You will learn how to use page objects to hide the technical details of locators, and divide operations on pages into separate classes and create test cases that are more readable and easy to maintain. You will then learn how to create data-driven tests using the unittest library.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Advanced Techniques of Selenium WebDriver">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Advanced Techniques of Selenium WebDriver</em>, dives into some of the advanced techniques of using Selenium for automating browsers for testing. You will learn how to use various action methods for simulating complex mouse and keyboard operations using Selenium. You will see how to handle session cookies, capture screenshots during a test run, and create a movie of the entire test run.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Integration with Other Tools and Frameworks">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Integration with Other Tools and Frameworks</em>, shows you how to use Selenium WebDriver with automated acceptance testing frameworks such as Behave and Continuous Integration tools. You will first learn how to integrate Selenium with Behave to create automated acceptance tests. We will implement a sample feature and acceptance tests on UI using the Selenium WebDriver. At end of the chapter, we will set up running the tests that we created as part of Continuous Integration using Jenkins. We will set up a schedule to run the tests on a daily frequency.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have learned all the essential features of Selenium WebDriver to create your own web testing framework in Python.</p></div></div></div>

- en: Shortly after I started writing, a friend asked me if there really was a need
    of another *Learning Python* book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'An excellent question that we could also express in another form: What has
    this book to offer? What makes this book different from the average introductory
    book on Python?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think there are two main differences and many good reasons why you would want
    to read it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Firstly, we start with introducing some important programming concepts. We build
    a solid foundation by covering the critical aspects of this wonderful language.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The pace gradually increases, along with the difficulty of the subjects presented.
    By the end of [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Testing, Profiling, and Dealing
    with Exceptions"), *Testing, Profiling, and Dealing with Exceptions*, we will
    cover all the fundamentals.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. The Edges – GUIs and Scripts"), *The
    Edges – GUIs and Scripts*, onward, the book takes a steep turn, which brings us
    to difference number two.

- en: To consolidate the knowledge acquired, there is nothing like working on a small
    project. So, in the second part of the book, each chapter delivers a project on
    a different subject. We explore scripting, graphical interfaces, data science,
    and web programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each project is small enough to fit within a chapter and yet big enough to be
    relevant. Each chapter is interesting, conveys a message, and teaches something
    valuable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After a short section on debugging, the book ends with a complete example that
    wraps things up. I tried to craft it so that you will be able to expand it in
    several ways.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, this is definitely not the usual *Learning Python* book. Its approach is
    much more "hands-on" and practical.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wanted to empower you to help you become a true Python ninja. But I also did
    my best to entertain you and foster your logical thinking and creativity along
    the way.

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Built-in Data Types"), *Built-in Data Types*,
    introduces you to Python built-in data types. Python has a very rich set of native
    data types and this chapter will give you a description and a short example for
    each of them.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Functions, the Building Blocks of Code"),
    *Functions, the Building Blocks of Code*, teaches you how to write functions.
    Functions are the keys to reusing code, to reducing debugging time, and in general,
    to writing better code.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Saving Time and Memory"), *Saving Time and
    Memory*, introduces you to the functional aspects of Python programming. This
    chapter teaches you how to write comprehensions and generators, which are powerful
    tools that you can use to speed up your code and save memory.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Advanced Concepts – OOP, Decorators, and
    Iterators"), *Advanced Concepts – OOP, Decorators, and Iterators*, teaches you
    the basics of object-oriented programming with Python. It shows you the key concepts
    and all the potentials of this paradigm. It also shows you one of the most beloved
    characteristics of Python: decorators. Finally, it also covers the concept of
    iterators.'

    *Testing, Profiling, and Dealing with Exceptions*, teaches you how to make your
    code more robust, fast, and stable using techniques such as testing and profiling.
    It also formally defines the concept of exceptions.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. The Edges – GUIs and Scripts"), *The Edges
    – GUIs and Scripts*, guides you through an example from two different points of
    view. They are at the extremities of a spectrum: one implementation is a script
    and the other one a proper graphical user interface application.'

    Up – A Complete Example*, presents a Django website that acts as an interface

    takes all the concepts covered in the book to the next level and suggests where
    to go to dig deeper and take the next steps.'

- en: 'You are encouraged to follow the examples in this book. In order to do so,
    you will need a computer, an Internet connection, and a browser. The book is written
    in Python 3.4, but it should also work with any Python 3.* version. I have written
    instructions on how to install Python on the three main operating systems used
    today: Windows, Mac, and Linux. I have also explained how to install all the extra
    libraries used in the various examples and provided suggestions if the reader
    finds any issues during the installation of any of them. No particular editor
    is required to type the code; however, I suggest that those who are interested
    in following the examples should consider adopting a proper coding environment.
    I have given suggestions on this matter in the first chapter.'

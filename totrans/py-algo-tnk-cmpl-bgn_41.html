<h3 id="toc_1">29.1 Simple Exercises with Loop Control Structures</h3>
<h4 id="toc_2">Exercise 29.1-1 Counting the Numbers According to Which is Greater</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter 10 pairs of numbers and then counts and displays the number of times that the first user-provided number was greater than the second one and the number of times that the second one was greater than the first one.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">The Python program is as follows. It uses variable countA to count the number of times that the first user-provided number was greater than the second one and variable countB to count the number of times that the second one was greater than the first one.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.1-1</div>
<div><p>countA = 0</p>
<p>countB = 0</p>
<div></div>
<p>for i in range(10):</p>
<p>a = int(input("Enter number A: "))</p>
<p>b = int(input("Enter number B: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>if a &gt; b:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>countA += 1</p></blockquote></div>
<p>elif b &gt; a:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>countB += 1</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>print(countA, countB)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">A reasonable question that someone may ask is “Why is a multiple-decision control structure being used? Why not use a dual-alternative decision structure instead?”</p>
<p class="my_basic">Suppose, indeed, that a dual-alternative decision structure, such as the following, is used.</p>
<div><p>if a &gt; b:</p>
<p>countA += 1</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>countB += 1</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">In this decision control structure, the variable countB would increment when variable b is greater than variable a (this is desirable) but also when variable b is equal to variable a (this is undesirable). Using a multiple-decision control structure instead would ensure that variable countB increments only when variable b is greater than (and not when it is equal to) variable a.</p>
<h4 id="toc_3">Exercise 29.1-2 Counting the Numbers According to Their Digits</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter 20 integers and then counts and displays the total number of one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit integers. Assume that the user enters values between 1 and 999.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Using knowledge from <a href="chapter18.html#toc_4">Exercise 18.1-3</a>, the Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.1-2</div>

</div>
<h4 id="toc_4">Exercise 29.1-3 How Many Numbers Fit in a Sum</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter numeric values repeatedly until the sum of them exceeds 1000. At the end, the program must display the total quantity of numbers entered.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this case, since the exact number of iterations is unknown, a definite loop cannot be used; an indefinite loop is required. Let's employ a pre-test loop to create that loop. However, to ensure the program is free of logic errors, it is crucial to adhere to the “Ultimate” rule discussed in <a href="chapter28.html#toc_3">Section 28.3</a>. According to this rule, the pre-test loop structure should be as follows, given in general form.</p>
<div><p>Initialize total</p>
<p>while total &lt;= 1000 :</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements</p></div>
<div><p>Update/alter total</p></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Since loop's Boolean expression depends on variable total, this is the variable that must be initialized before the loop starts and also updated (altered) within the loop. And more specifically, the statement that updates/alters variable total must be the last statement of the loop. Following this, the Python program becomes</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.1-3</div>
<div><p>count = 0</p>
<div></div>
<p>total = 0   #Initialization of total</p>
<p>while total &lt;= 1000:   #Boolean expression dependent on total</p>
<p>x = float(input())</p>
<p>count += 1</p>
<div></div>
<p>total += x   #Update/alteration of total</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(count)</p>
</div>
<h4 id="toc_5">Exercise 29.1-4 Finding the Total Number of Positive Integers</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter integer values repeatedly until a real one is entered. At the end, the program must display the total number of positive integers entered.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Once again, you don't know the exact number of iterations, so you cannot use a for-loop.</p>
<p class="my_basic">According to the “Ultimate” rule, the pre-test loop structure should be as follows, given in general form.</p>
<div><p>x = float(input("Enter a number: "))   #Initialization of x</p>
<p>while int(x) == x:   #Boolean expression dependent on x</p>
<div><p>A statement or block of statements</p></div>
<p>x = float(input("Enter a number: "))   #Update/alteration of x</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">The final Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.1-4</div>
<div><p>count = 0</p>
<div></div>
<p>x = float(input("Enter a number: "))</p>
<p>while int(x) == x:</p>
<p>if x &gt; 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>count += 1</p></blockquote></div>
<p>x = float(input("Enter a number: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(count)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that the program operates properly even when the first user-provided number is a real (a float); the pre-test loop structure ensures that the flow of execution will never enter the loop for any real numbers!</p>

<h4 id="toc_6">Exercise 29.1-5 Iterating as Many Times as the User Wishes</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter two numbers and then calculates and displays the first number raised to the power of the second one. The program must iterate as many times as the user wishes. At the end of each calculation, the program must prompt the user if they wish to calculate again. If the answer is “yes” the program must repeat; it must end otherwise. Make your program accept the answer in all possible forms such as “yes”, “YES”, “Yes”, or even “YeS”.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">According to the “Ultimate” rule, the pre-test loop structure should be as follows, given in general form.</p>
<div><p>answer = "yes"    #Initialization of answer</p>
<p>while answer.upper() != "YES":</p>
<div><p>Prompt the user to enter two numbers and then calculate and display the first number raised to the power of the second one.</p></div>
<div></div>
<p>#Update/alteration of answer</p>
<p>answer = input("Would you like to repeat? ")</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>The upper() method ensures that the program operates properly for any user-provided answer: “yes”, “YES”, “Yes”, or even “YeS” or “yEs”!</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">However, instead of using the pre-test loop structure, let's employ the post-test loop structure this time. This is a better approach, as the initialization of the answer variable outside of the loop can be omitted. Unlike the pre-test loop structure, the flow of execution enters the loop in either way, and the initialization of the answer will be done inside the post-test loop, as shown in the code fragment (given in general form) that follows.</p>
<div><p>while True:</p>
<div><p>Prompt the user to enter two numbers and then calculate and display the first number raised to the power of the second one.</p></div>
<div></div>
<p>#Initialization and update/alteration of answer</p>
<p>answer = input("Would you like to repeat? ")</p>
<p>if answer.upper() != "YES": break</p>

<h4 id="toc_7">Exercise 29.1-6 Finding the Sum of the Digits</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter an integer and then calculates the sum of its digits.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">In <a href="chapter13.html#toc_3">Exercise 13.1-2</a>, you learned how to split the digits of an integer when its total number of digits was known. In this exercise however, the user is allowed to enter any value, no matter how small or large. Thus, the total number of the digits is an unknown quantity.</p>
<p class="my_basic">To solve this exercise, a loop control structure could be used. However, there are two approaches that you can use.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, the main idea is to isolate one digit at each iteration. However, the challenge lies in determining the total number of iterations required, as it hinges on the size of the user-provided integer. So, does this pose a roadblock? Certainly not!</p>
<p class="my_basic">Within the loop, the user-provided integer should undergo a continuous reduction with each iteration until it eventually reaches zero. That value of zero can act as a condition to stop the loop control structure from iterating. For instance, if the user-provided number is 4753, it should become 475 in the first iteration, 47 in the second iteration, then 4, and ultimately 0. Once it reaches 0, the iterations must stop.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's try to comprehend the proposed solution using the following flowchart. Some statements are written in general form.</p>
<p class="my_basic centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width31" src="img/chapter29-01.png"/></p>
<p class="my_basic">The statement</p>
<p class="my_basic center">digit ← Isolate last digit of variable x.</p>
<p class="my_basic">can be written using the well-known MOD 10 operation as shown here.</p>
<p class="my_basic center">digit ← x MOD 10</p>
<p class="my_basic">The whole concept, however, relies on the statement</p>
<p class="my_basic center">x ← Keep all except last digit of variable x.</p>
<p class="my_basic">This is the statement that eventually zeros the value of variable x, and the flow of execution then exits the loop. To write this statement you can use a DIV 10 operation as shown here.</p>
<p class="my_basic center">x ← x DIV 10</p>
<p class="my_basic">Accordingly, the Python program becomes</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.1-6a</div>
<div><p>x = int(input())</p>
<p>s = 0</p>
<div></div>
<p>while x != 0:</p>
<p>digit = x % 10     #This is the x MOD 10 operation</p>
<p>s = s + digit</p>
<p>x = x // 10        #This is the x DIV 10 operation</p>
<div></div>
<p>print(s)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Let's create a trace table for the input value 4753 to better understand what is really happening.</p>

<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, the main idea is to convert the user-provided integer to a string and then use a for-loop to iterate for all its characters (digits). In the for-loop, however, you need to convert each digit from type string back to type integer before it is accumulated in variable s. The Python program is as follows.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">29.2 Exercises with Nested Loop Control Structures</h3>
<h4 id="toc_9">Exercise 29.2-1 Displaying all Three-Digit Integers that Contain a Given Digit</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a digit (0 to 9) and then displays all three-digit integers that contain that user-provided digit at least once. For example, for the user-provided value 7, the values 357, 771, and 700 are such integers.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are three different approaches! The first one uses just one for-loop, the second one uses three for-loops, nested one within the other, and the last one uses Python's magic forces. Let's analyze them all!</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Using a for-loop and a decision control structure</p>
<p class="my_basic">The main idea is to use a for-loop where the value of variable counter goes from 100 to 999. Inside the loop, the counter variable is split into its individual digits (digit<sub>3</sub>, digit<sub>2</sub>, digit<sub>1</sub>) and a decision control structure is used to check if at least one of its digits is equal to the provided one. The Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.2-1a</div>
<div><p>x = int(input("Enter a digit 0 - 9: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>for i in range(100, 1000):</p>
<p>digit3 = i // 100</p>
<p>r = i % 100</p>
<p>digit2 = r // 10</p>
<p>digit1 = r % 10</p>
<div></div>
<p>if digit3 == x or digit2 == x or digit1 == x:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>print(i)</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">After some refinement, the program can be improved as follows</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.2-1b</div>
<div><p>x = int(input("Enter a digit 0 - 9: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>for i in range(100, 1000):</p>
<p>digit3, r = divmod(i, 100)</p>
<p>digit2, digit1 = divmod(r, 10)</p>
<div></div>
<p>if x in [digit1, digit2, digit3]:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>print(i)</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Using nested loop control structures and a decision control structure</p>
<p class="my_basic">The main idea here is to use three for-loops, nested one within the other. In this case, there are three counter variables (digit3, digit2, and digit1) and each one of them corresponds to one digit of the three-digit integer. The Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.2-1c</div>
<div><p>x = int(input("Enter a digit 0 - 9: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>for digit3 in range(1, 10):</p>
<p>for digit2 in range(10):</p>
<div><blockquote><p>for digit1 in range(10):</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><p>if x in [digit1, digit2, digit3]:</p></blockquote></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>print(digit3 * 100 + digit2 * 10 + digit1)</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">If you follow the flow of execution, the value 100 is the first “integer” evaluated (digit3 = 1, digit2 = 0, digit1 = 0). Then, the most-nested loop control structure increments variable digit1 by one and the next value evaluated is “integer” 101. This continues until digit1 reaches the value 9; that is, until the “integer” reaches the value 109. The flow of execution then exits the most-nested loop control structure, variable digit2 increments by one, and the most-nested loop control structure starts over again, thus the values evaluated are the “integers” 110, 111, 112, … 119. The process goes on until all integers up to the value 999 are evaluated.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that variable digit3 starts from 1, whereas variables digit2 and digit1 start from 0. This is necessary since the scale for three-digit numbers begins from 100 and not from 000.</p>
<p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note how the print statement composes the three-digit integer.</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Third approach – The Pythonic way (version 1.0)</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, the counter variable of a for-loop is converted to string and unpacked into three individual variables as shown here.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.2-1d</div>
<div><p>x = input("Enter a digit 0 - 9: ")</p>

<p>for i in range(100, 1000):</p>
<p>digit3, digit2, digit1 = str(i)</p>
<p>if x in [digit3, digit2, digit1]:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>print(i)</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that variable x, as well as variables digit1, digit2, and digit3, are of type string.</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Fourth approach – The Pythonic way (version 2.0)</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this approach, the counter variable of a for-loop is converted to string and the in operator checks if the user-provided “digit” exists in the string. The Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.2-1e</div>

<h3 id="toc_11">29.3 Data Validation with Loop Control Structures</h3>
<p class="my_basic">As you already know, data validation is the process of restricting data input, which forces the user to enter only valid values. You have already encountered one method of data validation using decision control structures. Let's recall an example.</p>
<div><p>from math import sqrt</p>
<div></div>
<p>x = float(input("Enter a non-negative number: "))</p>
<div></div>
<p>if x &lt; 0:</p>
<p>print("Error: Negative number entered!")</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>print(sqrt(x))</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">This approach, however, may not be the most convenient for the user. If they enter an invalid number, the program displays the error message, and the flow of execution inevitably reaches the end. The user must then restart the program to re-enter a valid number.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Next, you will find three approaches given in general form for validating data input using loop control structures. In cases where a user enters an invalid value, the primary objective is to prompt them repeatedly until they eventually provide a valid one. Of course, if the user initially enters a valid value, the flow of execution simply proceeds to the next section of the program.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Which approach you use depends on whether or not you wish to display an error message and whether you wish to display different error messages, one for each type of input error, or just a generic error message for any kind of error.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach – Validating data input without error messages</p>
<p class="my_basic">To validate data input without displaying any error messages, you can use the following code fragment given in general form.</p>
<div><p>while True:</p>
<p>input_data = input("Prompt message")</p>
<p>if input_data test 1 succeeds and    \</p>
<p>input_data test 2 succeeds and    \</p>
<p>…</div>
<div>input_data test N succeeds: break</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach – Validating data input with a generic error message</p>
<p class="my_basic">To validate data input and display a generic error message (that is, the same error message for any type of input error), you can use the following code fragment given in general form.</p>
<div><p>input_data = input("Prompt message")</p>
<p>while input_data test 1 fails or    \</p>
<p>input_data test 2 fails or    \</p>
<p>…</div>
<div>input_data test N fails:</p>
<p>print("Error message")</p>
<p>input_data = input("Prompt message")</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Third approach – Validating data input with different error messages</p>
<p class="my_basic">To validate data input and display a different error message for each type of input error, you can use the following code fragment given in general form.</p>
<div><p>while True:</p>
<p>input_data = input("Prompt message")</p>
<p>failure = False</p>
<p>if input_data test 1 fails:</p>

<div><blockquote><p>failure = True</p></blockquote></div>

<p class="my_basic">In <a href="chapter22.html#toc_8">Section 22.2</a> you learned how to find the minimum and maximum values among four values using single-alternative decision structures. Now, the following code fragment achieves the same result but uses only one variable w, for the user-provided values.</p>
<div><p>w = int(input())     #User enters 1st value</p>
<p>maximum = w</p>
<div></div>
<p>w = int(input())     #User enters 2nd value</p>
<p>if w &gt; maximum:</p>
<p>maximum = w</p>
<div></div>
<p>w = int(input())     #User enters 3rd value</p>
<p>if w &gt; maximum:</p>
<p>maximum = w</p>
<div></div>
<p>w = int(input())     #User enters 4th value</p>
<p>if w &gt; maximum:</p>
<p>maximum = w</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Except for the first pair of statements, all other blocks of statements are identical. Therefore, you can retain only one of these pairs and enclose it within a loop control structure that performs three iterations, as presented below.</p>
<div><p>w = int(input())     #User enters 1st value</p>
<p>maximum = w</p>
<div></div>
<p>for i in range(3):</p>

<p>if w &gt; maximum:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>maximum = w</p></blockquote></div>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Of course, if you want to allow the user to enter more values, you can simply increase the final_value of the for-loop.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Accordingly, a program that finds and displays the heaviest person among 10 individuals is presented next.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.4a</div>
<div><p>w = int(input("Enter a weight (in pounds): "))</p>

<p>w = int(input("Enter a weight (in pounds): "))</p>
<p>if w &gt; maximum:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>maximum = w</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>print(maximum)</p>
</div>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that the for-loop iterates one time less than the total number of user-provided values.</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Even though this Python program operates fine, let's do something slightly different. Instead of prompting the user to enter the first value before the loop and the remaining nine values within the loop, let's prompt them to enter all values within the loop.</p>
<p class="my_basic">However, the issue that arises here is that, no matter what, an initial value must always be assigned to the variable maximum before the loop starts iterating. But, this value cannot be arbitrarily chosen; it depends on the given problem. Therefore, choosing an “almost arbitrary” initial value requires careful consideration, as an incorrect choice may yield inaccurate results.</p>
<p class="my_basic">In this exercise, all user-provided values have to do with people's weight. Since there is no chance of finding any person with a negative weight (at least not on planet Earth), you can safely assign the initial value −1 to variable maximum, as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.4b</div>
<div><p>maximum = -1</p>
<div></div>
<p>for i in range(10):</p>
<p>w = int(input("Enter a weight (in pounds): "))</p>
<p>if w &gt; maximum:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>maximum = w</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>print(maximum)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Once the flow of execution enters the loop, the user enters the first value and the decision control structure evaluates to True. The initial value −1 in variable maximum is then overwritten by this first user-provided value and afterward, the flow of execution proceeds normally.</p>
<div><p class="notice"><img alt="" class="notice_image" src="img/notice.jpg"/>Note that this method may not be applicable in all cases. If an exercise requires prompting the user to enter any number (not limited to positive ones), this method cannot be applied, as the user could potentially enter only negative values. If this were to occur, the initial value of −1 would never be replaced by any of the user-provided values. This method can be used to find the maximum value only when the lower limit of user-provided values is known, or to find the minimum value only when the upper limit of user-provided values is known. For instance, if the exercise requires finding the lightest person, you can assign the initial value +1500 to variable minimum, as there is no human on Earth who can weigh that much! For reference, Jon Brower Minnoch was an American who, at his peak weight, was recorded as the heaviest human being ever, weighing approximately 1,400 lb!!!!!</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that lets the user enter a positive integer and then displays the total number of its divisors.</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">Let's see some examples.</p>
<p>►The divisors of value 12 are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.</p>
<p>►The divisors of value 15 are numbers 1, 3, 5, 15.</p>
<p>►The divisors of value 20 are numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.</p>
<p>►The divisors of value 50 are numbers 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.</p>
<p class="my_basic">If variable x contains the user-provided integer, all possible divisors of x are between 1 and x. Thus, all you need here is a for-loop where the value of variable counter goes  from 1 to x and, in each iteration, a simple-alternative decision structure checks whether the value of counter is a divisor of x, The Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.5-4a</div>
<div><p>x = int(input())</p>

<p>if x % i == 0:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>numberOfDivisors += 1</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>print(numberOfDivisors)</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">This program, for input value 20, performs 20 iterations. However, wouldn't it be even better if it could perform less than the half of the iterations and achieve the same result? Of course it would! So, let's make it more efficient!</p>
<p class="my_basic">As you probably know, for any user-provided integer (in variable x)</p>
<p>►the value 1 is always a divisor.</p>
<p>►the user-provided integer is always a divisor of itself.</p>
<p>►except for the user-provided integer, there are no other divisors after the middle of the range 1 to x.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Accordingly, for any integer there are certainly 2 divisors, the value 1 and the user-provided integer itself. Therefore, the program must check for other possible divisors starting from the value 2 until the middle of the range 1 to x. The improved Python program is as follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.5-4b</div>

<p class="my_basic">The more fractions you have, the better the accuracy! Thus, to calculate this formula the program needs to perform many iterations so as to use as many fractions as possible. But, of course, it can't iterate forever! The loop must actually stop iterating when the current calculated value of π and the one calculated in the previous iteration are ”close enough”, which means that the absolute value of their difference has become very small. The constant ACCURACY defines how small this difference must be. The Python program is shown here.</p>

<p class="my_basic">Confused? Let's try to approximate the value 0.333 with a fraction, iterating through all possible combinations of N and M.</p>

<p class="my_exercise_wordings">There is a myth about a poor man who invented chess. The King of India was so pleased with that new game that he offered to give the poor man anything he wished for. The poor but wise man told his King that he would like one grain of rice for the first square of the board, two grains for the second, four grains for the third and so on, doubled for each of the 64 squares of the game board. This seemed to the King to be a modest request, so he ordered his servants to bring the rice.</p>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">Write a Python program that calculates and displays how many grains of rice, and how many pounds of rice, will be on the chessboard in the end. Suppose that one pound of rice contains about 30,000 grains of rice.</p>

<p class="my_basic">Assume a chessboard of only 2 × 2 = 4 squares and a variable grains assigned the initial value 1 (this is the number of grains of the 1<sup>st</sup> square).

<h4 id="toc_32">Exercise 29.6-4 Is the Message a Palindrome?</h4>
<p class="my_exercise_wordings">A palindrome is a word or sentence that reads the same both backwards and forward. (You may recall from <a href="chapter22.html#toc_26">Exercise 22.5-4</a> that a number can also be a palindrome). Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a word or sentence and then displays a message stating whether or not the user-provided word or sentence is a palindrome. Following are some palindrome words and messages.</p>
<p>►Anna</p>
<p>►Radar</p>
<p>►Madam</p>
<p>►A nut for a jar of tuna.</p>
<p>►Dennis and Edna sinned.</p>
<p>►Murder for a jar of red rum.</p>
<p>►Borrow or rob?</p>
<p>►Are we not drawn onward, we few, drawn onward to new era?</p>
<p class="intense_quote">Solution</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are some things you should keep in mind before starting to compare the letters one by one and checking whether the first letter is the same as the last one, the second letter is the same as the last but one, and so forth.</p>
<p>►In a given sentence or word, some letters may be in uppercase and some in lowercase. For example, in the sentence “A nut for a jar of tuna”, even though the first and last letters are the same, they are not considered equal. Thus, the program must first convert all the letters—for example, to lowercase—before it can start comparing them.</p>
<p>►Removing characters like spaces, periods, question marks, and commas is crucial for the program to accurately compare the letters. For example, without this step, in the sentence “Borrow or rob?” the program will mistakenly assume it's not a palindrome, as it would attempt to compare the initial “B” with the final question mark “?”.</p>
<p>►Assume that the examined sentence is “Borrow or rob?”. After changing all letters to lowercase and after removing all unwanted spaces and the question mark, the sentence becomes “borroworrob”. These letters and their corresponding position in the string are as follows:</p>
<p class="centered_image"><img alt="Image" class="width36" src="img/chapter29-17.png"/></p>
<p>What you should realize here is that the for-loop should iterate for only half of the letters. Can you figure out why?</p>
<p>The program should start the iterations and compare the letter at position 0 with the letter at position 10. Then it should compare the letter at position 1 with the letter at position 9, and so forth. The last iteration should be the one that compares the letters at positions 4 and 6. It would be pointless to continue checking thereafter, since all letters have already been compared.</p>
<p class="my_basic">There are many solutions to this problem. Some of them are presented below. Comments written within the programs can help you fully understand the way they operate. However, if you still have doubts about how they operate you can use an IDE (IDLE or Visual Studio Code) to execute them step by step and observe the values of the variables in each step.</p>
<p class="strong">First approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">The solution is presented here.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.6-4a</div>
<div><p>message = input("Enter a message: ").lower()</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Create a new string which contains all except spaces, commas, periods, and question marks</p>
<p>messageClean = ""</p>
<p>for letter in message:</p>
<p>if letter != " " and letter != "," and letter != "." and letter != "?":</p>
<div><blockquote><p>messageClean += letter</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>j = len(messageClean) – 1  #This is the last position of messageClean</p>
<p>middlePos = j // 2         #This is the middle position of messageClean</p>
<div></div>
<p>palindrome = True  #In the beginning, assume that sentence is palindrome</p>
<div></div>
<p>#This for-loop compares letters one by one.</p>
<p>for i in range(middlePos + 1):</p>
<p>leftLetter = messageClean[i]</p>
<p>rightLetter = messageClean[j]</p>
<div></div>
<p>#If at least one pair of letters fails to validate set variable palindrome to False</p>
<p>if leftLetter != rightLetter:</p>
<div><blockquote><p>palindrome = False</p></blockquote></div>
<p>j -= 1</p>
<div></div>
<p>#If variable palindrome is still True</p>
<p>if palindrome:</p>
<p>print("The message is palindrome")</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Second approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">The previous approach works fine, but let's assume that the user enters a very large sentence that is not a palindrome; for example, its second letter is not the same as the last but one. Unfortunately, in the previous approach, the last for-loop continues to iterate until the middle of the sentence despite the fact that the variable palindrome has been set to False, even from the second iteration. So, let's try to make this program even better. As you already know, you can break out of a loop before it completes all of its iterations using the break statement.</p>
<p class="my_basic">Furthermore, you can improve the previous approach in two ways:</p>
<p>►You can remove spaces, commas, periods, and question marks from the variable message, using the not in membership operator.</p>
<p>►Instead of using the variable j to access the letters of variable messageClean on the right, you can use negative indexes.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The solution is shown here.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.6-4b</div>
<div><p>message = input("Enter a message: ").lower()</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Remove spaces, commas, periods and question marks using the "not in" membership operator</p>
<p>messageClean = ""</p>
<p>for letter in message:</p>
<p>if letter not in " ,.?":</p>
<div><blockquote><p>messageClean += letter</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>middlePos = (len(messageClean) - 1) // 2</p>
<div></div>
<p>palindrome = True</p>
<div></div>
<p>for i in range(middlePos + 1):</p>
<p>if messageClean[i] != messageClean[-i - 1]:  #Right letter uses negative index</p>
<div><blockquote><p>palindrome = False</p></blockquote></div>
<div><blockquote><p>break</p></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<p>if palindrome:</p>
<p>print("The message is palindrome")</p>
</div>
<p class="strong">Third approach</p>
<p class="my_basic">A more Pythonic and sophisticated way is to remove spaces, commas, periods, and question marks using the replace() method, and then just compare messageClean to its reversed value.</p>
<p class="my_basic">The solution is shown here.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.6-4c</div>
<div><p>message = input("Enter a message: ").lower()</p>
<div></div>
<p>#Create a new string which contains letters without spaces, commas, periods or question marks</p>
<p>messageClean = message</p>
<p>for c in " ,.?":</p>
<p>messageClean = messageClean.replace(c, "")</p>
<div></div>
<p>if messageClean == messageClean[::-1]:</p>
<p>print("The message is palindrome")</p>
</div>
<p class="my_basic">Furthermore, since there are just four different characters that must be removed (spaces, commas, periods, and question marks) you can avoid the first loop if you just chain four replace() methods, as shown in the Python program that follows.</p>
<div><img alt="" class="my_exercise_header_image" src="img/my_exercise_header.png"/> file_29.6-4d</div>
<div><p>message = input("Enter a message: ").lower()</p>

<div></div>
<p>if messageClean == messageClean[::-1]:</p>
<p>print("The message is palindrome")</p>

<p>39)The size of a TV screen always refers to its diagonal measurement. For example, a 40-inch TV screen is 40 inches diagonally, from one corner on top to the other corner on bottom. The old TV screens had a width-to-height aspect ratio of 4:3, which means that for every 3 inches in TV screen height, there were 4 inches in TV screen width. Today, most TV screens have a width-to-height aspect ratio of 16:9, which means that for every 9 inches in TV screen height there are 16 inches in TV screen width. Using these aspect ratios and the Pythagorean Theorem, you can easily determine that:</p>
<p>►for all 4:3 TV screens</p>
<p>Width = Diagonal × 0.8</p>
<p>Height = Diagonal × 0.6</p>
<p>►for all 16:9 TV screens</p>
<p>Width = Diagonal × 0.87</p>
<p>Height = Diagonal × 0.49</p>

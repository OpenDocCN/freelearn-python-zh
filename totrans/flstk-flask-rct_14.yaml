    He was known for his love of clean and organized programming code, and his dream
    was to create a kingdom where all the snippet code lived in harmony. One day,
    as he was wandering through the land, he came across a castle in disarray. The
    code snippets were scattered everywhere, and there was no clear structure to be
    found.

    army of helper functions and organized them into modules, each with a specific
    purpose. He then declared that these modules were the building blocks of the kingdom,
    and with them, they could conquer the chaos.

    of well-structured, reusable code. They worked day and night until, finally, the
    newly organized kingdom was born. The snippets were organized, and the kingdom
    was a beauty to behold. This story captures the heart of code modularity, the
    practice of breaking down a program or system into smaller, self-contained modules
    or components. Blueprints in Flask encourage this modular approach to building
    web applications.

    down a large, complex system into smaller, independent, and reusable modules.
    In the history of web development, modular architecture became more apparent.
    The traditional monolithic architecture involved having all the components of
    a web application tightly coupled, resulting in a large, unwieldy code base that
    was difficult to maintain and scale.
  prefs: []

    isolation, which reduced the risk of breaking the entire application and made
    it easier to test and deploy changes independently. As a result, modular architecture
    quickly gained popularity among web developers, and many modern web development
    frameworks such as Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, and Angular have embraced this
    architectural style. The popularity of modular architecture has continued to grow

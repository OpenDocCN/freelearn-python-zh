- en: While a regular view can provide valuable information to users, there will be
    cases where a printed output is needed. Maybe it is a PDF document to be sent
    to a customer, or a paper document that is needed to support a physical process.
    To address these cases, Odoo apps support printed business reports. These are
    generated using QWeb and then exported to PDF documents, which can then be printed,
    emailed, or simply stored.

- en: Being QWeb-based means that the same skills that can be used for Kanban views
    and web pages can be reused to design reports. Beyond QWeb, specific mechanisms
    are used, such as report actions, paper formats, and the variables that are available
    for QWeb report rendering.

- en: In this chapter, examples will be used to illustrate how to structure and add
    content to a report. The usual report structure has a **header**, **details**,
    and **footer sections**. The content that can be added includes **field data**,
    including specific widgets such as images. Also common in reports is the need
    to present totals. All of these will be explained in detail in this chapter.

    the totals might have to be computed by the report.

    This template is similar to what is done for regular reports. An XML file is needed,
    along with the report action and the report QWeb template. The only difference

<p class="my_basic">Answer the following questions.</p>
<p>1)What is a loop control structure?</p>
<p>2)In a flowchart, how can you distinguish a decision control structure from a loop control structure?</p>
<p>3)Design the flowchart and write the Python statement (in general form) of a pre-test loop structure. Explain how this loop control structure operates.</p>
<p>4)Why is a pre-test loop structure named this way, and what is the fewest number of iterations it may perform?</p>
<p>5)If the statement or block of statements of a pre-test loop structure is executed N times, how many times is the Boolean expression of the structure evaluated?</p>
<p>6)Design the flowchart and write the corresponding Python statement (in general form) of a post-test loop structure. Explain how this loop control structure operates.</p>
<p>7)Why is a post-test loop structure named this way, and what is the fewest number of iterations it may perform?</p>
<p>8)If the statement or block of statements of a post-test loop structure is executed N times, how many times is the Boolean expression of the structure evaluated?</p>
<p>9)Design the flowchart and write the corresponding Python statement (in general form) of a mid-test loop structure. Explain how this loop control structure operates.</p>
<p>10)Design the flowchart and write the corresponding Python statement (in general form) of a for-loop. Explain how this loop control structure operates.</p>
<p>11)State the rules that apply to for-loops.</p>
<p>12)What are nested loops?</p>
<p>13)Write an example program that uses nested loop control structures and explain the way they are executed.</p>
<p>14)State the rules that apply to nested loops.</p>
<p>15)Design a diagram that could help someone decide which loop control structure is most appropriate to choose, depending on a given problem.</p>
<p>16)Describe the “Ultimate” rule and give two examples, in general form, using a pre-test and a post-test loop structure.</p>
<p>17)Suppose a Python program uses a loop control structure to search for a given word in an electronic English dictionary. Why is it critical to break out of the loop when the given word is found?</p>
<p>18)Why is it critical to clean out your loops?</p>
<p>19)What is an infinite loop?</p>

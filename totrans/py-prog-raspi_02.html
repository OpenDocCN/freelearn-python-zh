<p>In the previous chapter, we discussed printing a line of text on the screen. In this chapter, we will review arithmetic operations and variables in Python. We will also discuss strings and accepting user inputs in Python. You will learn about the Raspberry Pi's GPIO and its features and write code in Python that makes an LED blink using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO. We will also discuss a practical application of controlling the Raspberry Pi's GPIO.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Arithmetic operations</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Python enables performing all the standard arithmetic operations. Let's launch the Python interpreter and learn more:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Addition</strong>: Two numbers can be added using the <kbd>+</kbd> operand. The result is printed on the screen. Try the following example using the python interpreter:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;123+456 <br/>       579
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subtraction</strong>: Two numbers can be added using the <kbd>-</kbd> operand:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;456-123 <br/>       333 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;123-456 <br/>       -333
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiplication</strong>: Two numbers can be multiplied as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;123*456 <br/>       56088
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Division</strong>: Two numbers can be divided as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;456/22 <br/>       20.727272727272727 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;456/2.0 <br/>       228.0 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;int(456/228) <br/>       2
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modulus operator</strong>: In Python, the modulus operator (<kbd>%</kbd>) returns the remainder of a division operation:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;4%2 <br/>       0 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;3%2 <br/>       1
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>floor operator</strong> (<kbd>//</kbd>) is the opposite of the modulus operator. This operator returns the floor of the quotient, that is, the integer result, and discards the fractions:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;9//7 <br/>       1 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;7//3 <br/>       2 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;79//25 <br/>       3
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">Bitwise operators in Python</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In Python, it is possible to perform bit-level operations on numbers. This is especially helpful while parsing information from certain sensors. For example, Some sensors share their output at a certain frequency. When a new data point is available, a certain bit is set indicating that the data is available. Bitwise operators can be used to check whether a particular bit is set before retrieving the datapoint from the sensor.</p>
<p>If you are interested in a deep dive on bitwise operators, we recommend getting started at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation</a>.</p>
<p>Consider the numbers <kbd>3</kbd> and <kbd>2</kbd> whose binary equivalents are <kbd>011</kbd> and <kbd>010</kbd>, respectively. Let's take a look at different operators that perform the operation on every bit of the number:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The AND operator</strong>: The AND operator is used to perform the AND operation on two numbers. Try this using the Python interpreter:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;3&amp;2 <br/>       2
</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This is equivalent to the following AND operation:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">
   0 1 1 &amp;<br/>   0 1 0<br/>   --------<br/>   0 1 0 (the binary representation of the number 2)
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>The OR operator</strong>: The OR operator is used to perform the OR operation on two numbers as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;3|2 <br/>       3
</pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This is equivalent to the following OR operation:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">
   0 1 1 OR<br/>   0 1 0<br/>   --------<br/>   0 1 1 (the binary representation of the number 3)
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>The NOT operator</strong>: The NOT operator flips the bits of a number. see the following example:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;~1 <br/>       -2
</pre>
<p>In the preceding example, the bits are flipped, that is, <kbd>1</kbd> as <kbd>0</kbd> and <kbd>0</kbd> as <kbd>1</kbd>. So, the binary representation of <kbd>1</kbd> is <kbd>0001</kbd> and when the bitwise NOT operation is performed, the result is <kbd>1110</kbd>. The interpreter returns the result as <kbd>-2</kbd> because negative numbers are stored as their <em>two's complement</em>. The two's complement of <kbd>1</kbd> is <kbd>-2</kbd>.</p>
<p>For a better understanding of two's complement and so on, we recommend reading the following articles, <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators">https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The XOR operator</strong>: An exclusive OR operation can be performed as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;3^2 <br/>       1
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Left shift operator</strong>: The left shift operator enables shifting the bits of a given value to the left by the desired number of places. For example, bit shifting the number <kbd>3</kbd> to the left gives us the number <kbd>6</kbd>. The binary representation of the number <kbd>3</kbd> is <kbd>0011</kbd>. Left shifting the bits by one position will give us <kbd>0110</kbd>, that is, the number <kbd>6</kbd>:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;3&lt;&lt;1 <br/>       6
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right shift operator</strong>: The right shift operator enables shifting the bits of a given value to the right by the desired number of places. Launch the command-line interpreter and try this yourself. What happens when you bit shift the number <kbd>6</kbd> to the right by one position?</li>
</ul>

                <h1 class="header-title">Logical operators</h1>
            

            
                
<p><strong>Logical operators</strong> are used to check different conditions and execute the code accordingly. For example, detecting a button interfaced to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO being pressed and executing a specific task as a consequence. Let's discuss the basic logical operators:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EQUAL</strong>: The EQUAL (<kbd>==</kbd>) operator is used to compare if two values are equal:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;3==3 <br/>       True <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;3==2 <br/>       False
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>NOT EQUAL</strong>: The NOT EQUAL (<kbd>!=</kbd>) operator compares two values and returns <kbd>True</kbd> if they are not equal:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;3!=2 <br/>       True <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;2!=2 <br/>       False
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>GREATER THAN</strong>: This operator (<kbd>&gt;</kbd>) returns <kbd>True</kbd> if one value is greater than the other value:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;3&gt;2 <br/>       True <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;2&gt;3 <br/>       False
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>LESS THAN</strong>: This operator compares two values and returns <kbd>True</kbd> if one value is smaller than the other:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;2&lt;3 <br/>       True <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;3&lt;2 <br/>       False
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO (&gt;=)</strong>: This operator compares two values and returns <kbd>True</kbd> if one value is greater/bigger than or equal to the other value:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;4&gt;=3 <br/>       True <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;3&gt;=3 <br/>       True <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;2&gt;=3 <br/>       False
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO (&lt;=)</strong>: This operator compares two values and returns <kbd>True</kbd> if one value is smaller than or equal to the other value:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;2&lt;=2 <br/>       True <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;2&lt;=3 <br/>       True <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;3&lt;=2 <br/>       False

                <h1 class="header-title">Data types and variables in Python</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In Python, <strong>variables</strong> are used to store a result or a value in the computer's memory during the execution of a program. Variables enable easy access to a specific location on the computer's memory and enables writing user-readable code.</p>
<p>For example, let's consider a scenario where a person wants a new ID card from an office or a university. The person would be asked to fill out an application form with relevant information, including their name, department, and emergency contact information. The form would have the requisite fields. This would enable the office manager to refer to the form while creating a new ID card.</p>
<p>Similarly, variables simplify code development by providing means to store information in the computer's memory. It would be very difficult to write code if one had to write code keeping the storage memory map in mind. For example, it is easier to use the variable called name rather than a specific memory address like <kbd>0x3745092</kbd>.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of data types in Python. Let's review the different data types:</p>
<ul>
<li>In general, names, street addresses, and so on are a combination of alphanumeric characters. In Python, they are stored as <em>strings</em>. Strings in Python are represented and stored in variables as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;name = 'John Smith' <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;address = '123 Main Street'
</pre>
<ul>
<li><em>Numbers</em> in Python could be stored as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;age = 29 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;employee_id = 123456 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;height = 179.5 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;zip_code = 94560
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Python also enables storing <em>boolean</em> variables. For example, a person's organ donor status can be either as <kbd>True</kbd> or <kbd>False</kbd>:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;organ_donor = True
</pre>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to <em>assign</em> values to multiple variables at the same time:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;a = c= 1 <br/>       &gt;&gt;&gt;b = a
</pre>
<ul>
<li>A variable may be <em>deleted</em> as follows:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
       &gt;&gt;&gt;del(a)
</pre>
<p>There are other data types in Python, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries. We will discuss this in detail in the next chapter.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Reading inputs from the user</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In the previous chapter, we printed something on the screen for the user. Now, we will discuss a simple program where we ask the user to enter two numbers and the program returns the sum of two numbers. For now, we are going to pretend that the user always provides a valid input.</p>
<p>In Python, user input to a Python program can be provided using the <kbd>input()</kbd> function (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input</a>):</p>
<pre>
    var = input("Enter the first number: ")
</pre>
<p>In the preceding example, we are making use of the <kbd>input()</kbd> function to seek the user's input of the number. The <kbd>input()</kbd> function takes the prompt <kbd>("Enter the first number: ")</kbd> as an argument and returns the user input. In this example, the user input is stored in the variable, <kbd>var</kbd>. In order to add two numbers, we make use of the <kbd>input()</kbd> function to request user to provide two numbers as input:</p>
<pre>
    var1 = input("Enter the first number: ") <br/>    var2 = input("Enter the second number: ") <br/>    total = int(var1) + int(var2) <br/>    print("The sum is %d" % total)
</pre>
<p>We are making use of the <kbd>input()</kbd> function to seek user input on two numbers. In this case, the user number is stored in <kbd>var1</kbd> and <kbd>var2</kbd>, respectively.<br/>
The user input is a string. We need to convert them into integers before adding them. We can convert a string to an integer using the <kbd>int()</kbd> function (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int</a>).</p>
<p>The <kbd>int()</kbd> function takes the string as an argument and returns the converted integer. The converted integers are added and stored in the variable, <kbd>total</kbd>. The preceding example is available for download along with this chapter as <kbd>input_function.py</kbd>.</p>
<p>If the user input is invalid, the <kbd>int()</kbd> function will throw an exception indicating that an error has occurred. Hence, we assumed that user inputs are valid in this example. In a later chapter, we will discuss catching exceptions that are caused by invalid inputs.</p>
<p>The following snapshot shows the program output:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="114" src="img/image_02_001.png" width="552"/></div>
<p>The input_function.py output</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">The formatted string output</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Let's revisit the example discussed in the previous section. We printed the result as follows:</p>
<pre>
    print("The sum is %d" % total)
</pre>
<p>In Python, it is possible to format a string to display the result. In the earlier example, we make use of <kbd>%d</kbd> to indicate that it is a placeholder for an integer variable. This enables printing the string with the integer. Along with the string that is passed an argument to the <kbd>print()</kbd> function, the variable that needs to be printed is also passed an argument. In the earlier example, the variables are passed using the <kbd>%</kbd> operator. It is also possible to pass multiple variables:</p>
<pre>
    print("The sum of %d and %d is %d" % (var1, var2, total))
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to format a string as follows:</p>
<pre>
    print("The sum of 3 and 2 is {total}".format(total=5))
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">The str.format() method</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The <kbd>format()</kbd> method enables formatting the string using braces (<kbd>{}</kbd>) as placeholders. In the preceding example, we use <kbd>total</kbd> as a placeholder and use the format method of the string class to fill each place holder.</p>

<p>Make use of the <kbd>format()</kbd> method to format a string with more than one variable.</p>
<p>Let's build a console/command-line application that takes inputs from the user and print it on the screen. Let's create a new file named <kbd>input_test.py</kbd>, (available along with this chapter's downloads) take some user inputs and print them on the screen:</p>
<pre>
    name = input("What is your name? ") <br/>    address = input("What is your address? ") <br/>    age = input("How old are you? ") <br/><br/>    print("My name is " + name) <br/>    print("I am " + age + " years old") <br/>    print("My address is " + address)
</pre>
<p>Execute the program and see what happens:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="95" src="img/image_02_002.png" width="502"/></div>
<p>The input_test.py output</p>
<p>The preceding example is available for download along with this chapter as <kbd>input_test.py</kbd>.</p>

<p>Repeat the earlier example using the string formatting techniques.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Concatenating strings</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In the preceding example, we printed the user inputs in combination with another string. For example, we took the user input <kbd>name</kbd> and printed the sentence as <kbd>My name is Sai</kbd>. The process of appending one string to another is called <strong>concatenation</strong>.</p>
<p>In Python, strings can be concatenated by adding <kbd>+</kbd> between two strings:</p>
<pre>
    name = input("What is your name? ") <br/>    print("My name is " + name)
</pre>
<p>It is possible to concatenate two strings, but it is not possible to concatenate an integer. Let's consider the following example:</p>
<pre>
    id = 5 <br/>    print("My id is " + id)
</pre>
<p>It would throw an error implying that integers and strings cannot be combined:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="46" src="img/image_02_003.png" width="457"/></div>
<p>An exception</p>
<p>It is possible to convert an integer to string and concatenate it to another string:</p>
<pre>
    print("My id is " + str(id))
</pre>
<p>This would give the following result:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="36" src="img/image_02_004.png" width="517"/></div>

                <h1 class="header-title">Loops in Python</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Sometimes, a specific task has to be repeated several times. In such cases, we could use <strong>loops</strong>. In Python, there are two types of loops, namely the <kbd>for</kbd> loop and <kbd>while</kbd> loop. Let's review them with specific examples.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">A for loop</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In Python, a <kbd>for</kbd> loop is used to execute a task for <em>n</em> times. A for loop iterates through each element of a sequence. This sequence could be a dictionary, list, or any other iterator. For example, let's discuss an example where we execute a loop:</p>
<pre>
    for i in range(0, 10): <br/>       print("Loop execution no: ", i)
</pre>
<p>In the preceding example, the <kbd>print</kbd> statement is executed 10 times:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="141" src="img/image_02_005.png" width="228"/></div>
<p>In order to execute the <kbd>print</kbd> task 10 times, the <kbd>range()</kbd> function (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range">https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range</a>) was used. The <kbd>range</kbd> function generates a list of numbers for a start and stop values that are passed as an arguments to the function. In this case, <kbd>0</kbd> and <kbd>10</kbd> are passed as arguments to the <kbd>range()</kbd> function. This returns a list containing numbers from <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd>. The <kbd>for</kbd> loop iterates through the code block for each element in steps of 1. The <kbd>range</kbd> function can also generate a list of numbers in steps of 2. This is done by passing the start value, stop value, and the step value as arguments to the <kbd>range()</kbd> function:</p>
<pre>
    for i in range(0, 20, 2): <br/>       print("Loop execution no: ", i)
</pre>
<p>In this example, <kbd>0</kbd> is the start value, <kbd>20</kbd> is the stop value, and <kbd>2</kbd> is the step value. This generates a list of 10 numbers in steps of two:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="164" src="img/image_02_006.png" width="202"/></div>
<p>The <kbd>range</kbd> function can be used to count down from a given number. Let's say we would like to count down from <kbd>10</kbd> to <kbd>1</kbd>:</p>
<pre>
    for i in range(10, 0, -1): <br/>       print("Count down no: ", i)
</pre>
<p>The output would be something like:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="160" src="img/image_02_007.png" width="194"/></div>
<p>The general syntax of the <kbd>range</kbd> function is <kbd>range(start, stop, step_count)</kbd>. It generates a sequence of numbers from <kbd>start</kbd> to <kbd>n-1</kbd> where <kbd>n</kbd> is the stop value.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Indentation</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Note the <em>indentation</em> in the <kbd>for</kbd> loop block:</p>
<pre>
    for i in range(10, 1, -1): <br/>       print("Count down no: ", i)
</pre>
<p>Python executes the block of code under the <kbd>for</kbd> loop statement. It is one of the features of the Python programming language. It executes any piece of code under the <kbd>for</kbd> loop as long as it has same level of indentation:</p>
<pre>
    for i in range(0,10): <br/>       #start of block <br/>       print("Hello") <br/>       #end of block
</pre>
<p>The indentation has the following two uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes the code readable</li>
<li>It helps us identify the block of code to be executed in a loop</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to pay attention to indentation in Python as it directly affects how a piece of code is executed.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Nested loops</h1>
            

            
                
<p>In Python, it is possible to implement <em>a loop within a loop.</em> For example, let's say we have to print <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>y</kbd> coordinates of a map. We can use nested loops to implement this:</p>
<pre>
for x in range(0,3): <br/>   for y in range(0,3): <br/>         print(x,y)
</pre>
<p>The expected output is:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="159" src="img/image_02_008.png" width="229"/><br/>
Be careful about code indentation in nested loops as it may throw errors. Consider the following example:</div>
<pre>
for x in range(0,10): <br/>   for y in range(0,10): <br/>   print(x,y)
</pre>
<p>The Python interpreter would throw the following error:</p>
<pre>
    SyntaxError: expected an indented block
</pre>
<p>This is visible in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="111" src="img/image_02_009.png" width="394"/></div>
<p>Hence, it is important to pay attention to indentation in Python (especially nested loops) to successfully execute the code. IDLE's text editor automatically indents code as you write them. This should aid with understanding indentation in Python.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">A while loop</h1>
            

            
                
<p><kbd>while</kbd> loops are used when a specific task is supposed to be executed until a specific condition is met. <kbd>while</kbd> loops are commonly used to execute code in an infinite loop. Let's look at a specific example where we would like to print the value of <kbd>i</kbd> from <kbd>0</kbd> to <kbd>9</kbd>:</p>
<pre>
i=0 <br/>while i&lt;10: <br/>  print("The value of i is ",i) <br/>  i+=1
</pre>
<p>Inside the <kbd>while</kbd> loop, we increment <kbd>i</kbd> by <kbd>1</kbd> for every iteration. The value of <kbd>i</kbd> is incremented as follows:</p>
<pre>
i += 1
</pre>
<p>This is equivalent to <kbd>i = i+1</kbd>.</p>
<p>This example would execute the code until the value of <kbd>i</kbd> is less than 10. It is also possible to execute something in an infinite loop:</p>
<pre>
i=0 <br/>while True: <br/>  print("The value of i is ",i) <br/>  i+=1
</pre>
<p>The execution of this infinite loop can be stopped by pressing <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>C</em> on your keyboard.</p>
<p>It is also possible to have nested <kbd>while</kbd> loops:</p>
<pre>
i=0 <br/>j=0 <br/>while i&lt;10: <br/>  while j&lt;10: <br/>    print("The value of i,j is ",i,",",j) <br/>    i+=1 <br/>    j+=1
</pre>
<p>Similar to <kbd>for</kbd> loops, <kbd>while</kbd> loops also rely on the indented code block to execute a piece of code.</p>
<p>Python enables printing a combination of strings and integers as long as they are presented as arguments to the <kbd>print</kbd> function separated by commas. In the earlier-mentioned example, <kbd>The value of i,j is</kbd>, <kbd>i</kbd> are arguments to the <kbd>print</kbd> function. You will learn more about functions and arguments in the next chapter. This feature enables formatting the output string to suit our needs.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Raspberry Pi's GPIO</h1>
            

            
                
<p>The Raspberry Pi Zero comes with a 40-pin GPIO header. Out of these 40 pins, we can use 26 pins either to read inputs (from sensors) or control outputs. The other pins are power supply pins (<strong>5V</strong>, <strong>3.3V</strong>, and <strong>Ground</strong> pins):</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="168" src="img/image_02_010.png" width="564"/></div>
<p>Raspberry Pi Zero GPIO mapping (source: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio-plus-and-raspi2/README.md)</p>
<p>We can use up to 26 pins of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO to interface appliances and control them. But, there are certain pins that have an alternative function, which will be discussed in the later chapters.</p>
<p>The earlier image shows the mapping of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The numbers in the circle correspond to the pin numbers on the Raspberry Pi's processor. For example, GPIO pin <strong>2</strong> (second pin from the left on the bottom row) corresponds to the GPIO pin <strong>2</strong> on the Raspberry Pi's processor and not the physical pin location on the GPIO header.</p>
<p>In the beginning, it might be confusing to try and understand the pin mapping. Keep a GPIO pin handout (available for download along with this chapter) for your reference. It takes some time to get used to the GPIO pin mapping of the Raspberry Pi Zero.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO pins are 3.3V tolerant, that is, if a voltage greater than 3.3V is applied to the pin, it may permanently damage the pin. When set to <em>high</em>, the pins are set to 3.3V and 0V when the pins are set to low.</p>

<p>Let's discuss an example where we make use of the Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO. We will interface an LED to the Raspberry Pi Zero and make it blink <em>on</em> and <em>off</em> with a 1-second interval.</p>
<p>Let's wire up the Raspberry Pi zero to get started:</p>

<p>Blinky schematic generated using Fritzing</p>
<p>In the preceding schematic, the GPIO pin 2 is connected to the anode (the longest leg) of the LED. The cathode of the LED is connected to the ground pin of the Raspberry Pi Zero. A 330 Ohm current limiting resistor is also used to limit the flow of the current.</p>

                <h1 class="header-title">Code</h1>
            

            
                
<p>We will make use of the <kbd>python3-gpiozero</kbd> library (<a href="https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.1/">https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.1/</a>). The <strong>Raspbian Jessie</strong> OS image comes with the pre-installed library. It is very simple to use, and it is the best option to get started as a beginner. It supports a standard set of devices that helps us get started easily.</p>
<p>For example, in order to interface an LED, we need to import the <kbd>LED</kbd> class from the <kbd>gpiozero</kbd> library:</p>
<pre>
from gpiozero import LED
</pre>
<p>We will be turning the LED <em>on</em> and <em>off</em> at a 1-second interval. In order to do so, we will be <em>importing</em> the <kbd>time</kbd> library. In Python, we need to import a library to make use of it. Since we interfaced the LED to the GPIO pin 2, let's make a mention of that in our code:</p>
<pre>
import time <br/><br/>led = LED(2)
</pre>
<p>We just created a variable named <kbd>led</kbd> and defined that we will be making use of GPIO pin 2 in the <kbd>LED</kbd> class. Let's make use of a <kbd>while</kbd> loop to turn the LED on and off with a 1-second interval.</p>
<p>The <kbd>gpiozero</kbd> library's LED class comes with functions named <kbd>on()</kbd> and <kbd>off()</kbd> to set the GPIO pin 2 to high and low, respectively:</p>
<pre>
while True: <br/>    led.on() <br/>    time.sleep(1) <br/>    led.off() <br/>    time.sleep(1)
</pre>
<p>In Python's time library, there is a <kbd>sleep</kbd> function that enables introducing a 1-second delay between turning on/off the LED. This is executed in an infinite loop! We just built a practical example using the Raspberry Pi Zero.</p>
<p>Putting all the code together in a file named <kbd>blinky.py</kbd> (available for download along with this book), run the code from the command-line terminal (alternatively, you may use IDLE3):</p>
<pre>
    <strong>python3 blinky.py</strong>
</pre>

                <h1 class="header-title">The applications of GPIO control</h1>
            

            
                
<p>Now that we have implemented our first example, let's discuss some possible applications of being able to control the GPIO. We could use the Raspberry Pi's GPIO to control the lights in our homes. We will make use of the same example to control a table lamp!</p>
<p>There is a product called the <strong>PowerSwitch Tail II</strong> (<a href="http://www.powerswitchtail.com/Pages/default.aspx">http://www.powerswitchtail.com/Pages/default.aspx</a>) that enables interfacing AC appliances like a table lamp to a Raspberry Pi. The PowerSwitch Tail comes with control pins (that can take a 3.3V high signal) that could be used to turn on/off a lamp. The switch comes with the requisite circuitry/protection to interface it directly to a Raspberry Pi Zero:</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="175" src="img/image_02_013.png" width="492"/></div>
<p>The Pi Zero interfaced to the PowerSwitch Tail II</p>
<p>Let's take the same example from the previous section and connect the GPIO pin 2 to the <strong>+in</strong> pin of the PowerSwitch Tail. Let's connect the ground pin of the Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO header to the PowerSwitch Tail's <strong>-in</strong> pain. The PowerSwitch Tail should be connected to the AC mains. The lamp should be connected to the AC output of the switch. If we use the same piece of code and connect a lamp to the PowerSwitch Tail, we should be able to turn on/off with a 1-second interval.</p>
<div><img class=" image-border" height="191" src="img/image_02_014.png" width="277"/></div>
<p>PowerSwitch Tail II connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero</p>
<p>This appliance control using the LED blinking code is just an example. It is not recommended to turn on/off a table lamp at such short intervals. In future chapters, we will make use of the Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO to control appliances from anywhere on the Internet.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we reviewed the integers, boolean, and string data types as well as arithmetic operations and logical operators in Python. We also discussed accepting user inputs and loops. We introduced ourselves to the Raspberry Pi Zero's GPIO and discussed an LED blinking example. We took the same example to control a table lamp!</p>
<p>Have you heard of the chat application named <em>Slack</em>? How about controlling a table lamp at home from your laptop at work? If that piques your interest, work with us toward that over the next few chapters.</p>

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another big difference between MEL and Python is how they treat whitespace characters
    (spaces, tabs, and newlines). MEL, like most languages, doesn't care about whitespace;
    statements are terminated with semicolons, and blocks of code are defined with
    matched sets of curly brackets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python, however, uses whitespace characters to control program flow. This is
    often one of the strangest things about Python to people who are new to the language,
    but not to programming. In Python, blocks of code are defined by indentation.
    You can use either tabs or spaces, but the key thing is that you're consistent.
    In Python, every time you increase the number of tabs (or spaces) at the start
    of a line, it's equivalent to adding an opening curly bracket, and every time
    you decrease that number, it's equivalent to a closing curly bracket. This can
    often be confusing, as the structure of your program is defined by characters
    that may not actually be visible. If you're new to Python and having trouble keeping
    track of your whitespace, you might want to change your editor settings to display
    whitespace characters. Most programmer-friendly text editors include such an option,
    and it can be a big help.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The specific list of options for each command can be found in the built-in Python
    documentation, accessible from within Maya by going to **Help** | **Python Command
    Reference**. For most commands, you'll find a long list of options.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make things even more complicated, every option has both a short name and
    a long name. For example, the polyCube allows you to specify the number of subdivisions
    along the X axis. You can use either the long name, "subdivisionsX" or the short
    name, "sx" to set it.

    that you're likely to remember) and long names for more obscure / more rarely

    to you right now, it may look confusing when you revisit it 6 months (or 6 years!)

- en: You may be wondering why Maya offers two different methods for scripting, MEL
    and Python. That's a simple case of backwards compatibility. MEL came first and
    was available in Maya long before Python support was added. Back then, you had
    to use MEL for day-to-day tasks, and if that couldn't provide you with what you
    needed, you had to dive into the C++ API (which was quite involved and hard to
    work with on non-Windows systems). Python unites both approaches, but MEL is still
    supported to allow older scripts to work. It's also possible that you might get
    better performance with MEL than with Python, as the Python functionality is a
    wrapper around MEL. Python is a much nicer language to work with though, so it's
    generally a worthwhile trade-off.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that the script editor doesn't (by default) show you everything that you
    do. Under normal circumstances, Maya shows you a slightly filtered output based
    on what you are most likely to be interested in. This is usually a good thing,
    but there are times when you'll want to disable it. To show *all* the output,
    go to the script editor and select **History** | **Echo all Commands**. This will
    cause Maya to output *everything* to the script editor. This generally means much,
    much more output than you want, but can sometimes be helpful. In practice, you'll
    generally want to leave that option off except when you're trying to replicate
    a given piece of functionality in a script, and the default output isn't giving
    you any insight into what Maya is doing.

    the C++ API (for larger scale plugins), is unified under the banner of Python.

    has the benefit of being more "Pythonic" and offering nicer syntax, but is not

    are numerous examples of ones that cannot be, mainly because it wouldn't make
    sense to do so. For example, it's perfectly reasonable to set construction history
    on or off when creating a new object, and it's certainly reasonable to query that
    after the fact, but what would it mean to use the edit mode to enable construction
    history on an object that didn't already have it? That would require rebuilding
    the history of the object, which may have been manipulated in various ways since
    it was created. As a result, the "constructionHistory" (or "ch") flag only offers
    the Create and Query options.

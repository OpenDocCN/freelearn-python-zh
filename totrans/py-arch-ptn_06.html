    <h1 id="_idParaDest-99" class="chapterTitle">Architectural Patterns</h1>&#13;&#13;
  </p>&#13;&#13;
  <p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">To be able to produce successful designs, it's not necessary to start from scratch. Instead, your efforts are better put into understanding which common architectural patterns have already been proven successful.</p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">In this section of the book, we will see different ideas that are common across a lot of successful systems. All these elements are useful in specific contexts, and we will see what their strengths and limitations are over the following chapters:</p>&#13;&#13;
    <ol>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="numbered"><strong class="keyword">The Twelve-Factor App Methodology</strong>, explaining this methodology</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="numbered"><strong class="keyword">Web Server Structures</strong>, describing how to deal effectively with response-request services</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="numbered"><strong class="keyword">Event-Driven Structure Basics</strong>, introducing how to work with events and communicate different services with them</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="numbered"><strong class="keyword">Advanced Event-Driven Structures</strong>, for creating complex flows of information, priorities, and CQRS</li>&#13;&#13;
      <li class="numbered"><strong class="keyword">Microservices vs Monolith</strong>, explaining the differences between them and the tools for dealing with them</li>&#13;&#13;
    </ol>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will introduce you to the Twelve-Factor App methodology, as it contains a list of useful suggestions for dealing with the specifics of services. We will also get into the specifics of web server request-response structures, which are normally the foundation of servers. </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We will also cover event-driven systems, taking two chapters to be sure to cover the basic and more advanced uses. Event-driven systems are asynchronous by nature, meaning that the calling system won't wait until the processing is done, and in a lot of cases, there won't even be something similar to a response. These systems are very useful for dealing either with triggering multiple services with the same input or for generating results that take a long time to process. </p>&#13;&#13;
    <p class="normal">We'll also discuss monolithic systems compared with microservices, and the different tools and techniques to use in both cases, including migrating from one to the other.</p>&#13;&#13;

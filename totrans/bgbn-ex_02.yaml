    circuit that you can interface with the BeagleBone board using the **general-purpose
    input/output** (**GPIO**) pins available on it. The chapter will focus on making
    the reader understand how to wire electronic circuits with an explanation of how

    on the projects, these topics have to be included in the chapter.

    to its leads in the proper configuration. An LED has two leads: the cathode and
    the anode, as shown in the following figure:'

    terminal of the power supply / battery to make the LED glow. Connecting in reverse
    won't make the LED glow. If you would like to know more about why and how an LED
    works, do your research online or read books to find out more.

    LED. The resistor is a component that reduces the value of current flowing through
    the circuit. It is used to increase the lifetime of the LED and is necessary for
    most LEDs. I would suggest you learn more about how much value of resistor should
    be used and for particular battery and LEDs that you use because this chapter
    and most of the sections in it are intended to give you a basic getting started
    idea regarding electronic circuits. As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter,
    electrical and electronics is a vast topic and we can't put all the concepts involved
    in it in just one chapter.

    in between, you will have made your first basic electronic circuit. But have an
    LED glow all time is something that now one would want right. We will always need
    an element to control another element. So here comes the switch, where if you
    connect a switch in between this circuit, you can turn the LED on and off when
    you want it to glow or not glow. So let's go ahead and look at the two most-used
    types of switches in electronic circuits, which we will be using in the coming
    chapters to interface with the BeagleBone board to give inputs from the outside
    world.

    circuit when the button is pressed and closes in normal state. Depending on which
    switch you use, the operation will differ for the circuit shown in the preceding
    figure. For normally closed, the LED will be always on and when you press the
    button, it will go off. For normally open, the operation will be as shown in the

    understand the concept of the toggle switch. Basically, it switches the state
    from on to off as we switch the position of the switch. Unlike the momentary switch,
    where we need to hold the switch button to switch the state, here, once you toggle
    the position, it stays in the position you left it. So we can toggle the switch
    from the Off to the On state, in other words, from the open to the closed state,
    as well as vice versa, and leave it as such and it will stay in the same position,
    in other words, in the state of either On or Off, as there is no spring mechanism
    to push the switch back to its previous position. The following diagrams will
    help you understand better:'

  zh: 现在你已经熟悉了开关操作的工作原理，你可以轻松理解切换开关的概念。基本上，它将状态从开启切换到关闭，就像我们切换开关的位置一样。与需要按住开关按钮来切换状态的瞬间开关不同，在这里，一旦你切换了位置，它就会保持在离开的位置。因此，我们可以将开关从关闭状态切换到开启状态，换句话说，从开启到关闭状态，以及反之亦然，并且保持这种状态，它将保持在相同的位置，换句话说，处于开启或关闭的状态，因为没有弹簧机制将开关推回到其原始位置。以下图表将帮助你更好地理解：

    and made the LED glow by switching the switch, by now you must have understood
    the concept of an electrical circuit and switching an electrical and electronic
    circuit using a switch. But using our BeagleBone board instead of doing it manually,
    we will be using the GPIOs to switch elements as well as read the switching inputs.
    We will see this in detail with experiments in the next chapters. For now, in

    these pins as input and output, as well as to change the state of these pins when
    defined as outputs and read the state when defined as inputs. In this book, as
    we will be using python as the primary programming language, we will be accessing
    these pins from the python program. To get started, you will first need to add

    Black through a 470-ohm resistor and the anode is connected to the GPIO pin 60
    on the P9 header. You can refer to the expansion headers of BeagleBone Black for
    reference. Once you have connected the circuit with the BeagleBone Black, we can
    go ahead and start working with Python to make this LED turn on and off.

    inside the processor chip is turned on from the software and this makes GPIO_60
    to HIGH state and it switches on and supplies 3.3V output, which makes the LED
    glow. You can now turn off the led by setting the GPIO_60 pin to the LOW state,
    as shown in the next step, by modifying the `GPIO.output` function to LOW.

    microprocessor on the BeagleBone board to turn off the GPIO_60 so it turns off
    and becomes LOW, and doesn't give out the 3.3V supply so the LED is turned off.

    software running on the board. These GPIO pins stay in the previous state until
    they are changed to another state. But in situations where you stop the software
    in the middle of an operation, you might need the GPIO pins to go back to their
    default state, which is LOW for most of them. To do this, the `Adafruit_BBIO`
    library provides us with a function `GPIO.cleanup()`, which we will be using to
    clear the previous states and definitions of the GPIOs set from the software.

    interactive shell and change its state. Let's now write a python code and save
    it as a `.py` file and run it like we did at the end of the previous chapter.
    The python program that is discussed in this section will make an LED blink at
    an interval of 1 second. The LED will be On for 1 second and Off for another 1
    second; this will loop continuously until you break the loop.

    in the interactive shell in the previous section of this chapter and then we set
    up GPIO_60 as an output pin and then changed the state of the pin to HIGH and
    LOW in the while loop that runs continuously. We use the `time.sleep(1)` function
    to pause the code for 1 second in between the state changes. The code also has
    the `GPIO.clean()` function that gets executed when a keyboard interrupt is given
    when the code is running.

    If you remember, in [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with BeagleBone"),
    *Getting Started with BeagleBone*, we used the BoneScript library to make the
    LEDs which are on the board turn on and stay on for a timeout interval. You can
    try writing some code of that sort also in python and try keeping the LED on for
    some interval of time. And turn it off based on the input you will be giving.

- en: Here we are at the end of this chapter, where we learnt the basic principle
    behind a simple electronic circuit using LEDs and switches. We saw what GPIOs
    are and how we can access them from python and wrote a simple code to make an
    LED blink at a particular interval. Then we added external libraries to python
    on BeagleBone boards. In the next chapter, we will be seeing how we can get an
    input from the external world and build a system that reacts to that input.

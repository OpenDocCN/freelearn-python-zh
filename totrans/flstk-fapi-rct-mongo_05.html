			<p class="calibre5">This chapter focuses on the React library and discusses the important topics and features that you should be aware of so that you can create a very simple React app, really just a frontend. In this chapter, you will learn about the main features and the most salient concepts <span>of React.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">You will begin with the prerequisites and tools, such as Node.js, some Visual Studio Code extensions, and more. You will also learn how to use the new standard and recommended build tool called <strong class="bold">Vite</strong>. Compared to <strong class="bold">Create React App</strong>, Vite is more efficient and allows for fast <strong class="bold">hot module replacement</strong> (<strong class="bold">HMR</strong>) and on-demand file serving, without the need for bundling. Bundling is the process of combining and joining multiple JavaScript files into a single file, reducing the number of HTTP requests needed to load the page. HMR, on the other hand, allows for the updating of single modules while the application is running, in <span>real time.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">You will design a simple application with a few components and see how decoupling helps you write modular and maintainable code. This chapter covers two of the most important React Hooks and how they solve some common web development problems. However, the main objective of this chapter is to discuss the tools needed to be able to explore React and its <span>various functionalities.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">By the end of this chapter, you will have a simple but fully functional React web app. The concepts in this chapter will prepare you to be a frontend developer who values relatively simple tools to be able to achieve complex functionalities, without being confined within a <span>strict framework.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">This chapter will cover the <span>following topics:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17">Introduction to React and how to use Vite to create <span>React apps</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17">Styling techniques with <span>Tailwind CSS</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17">The functional components and JSX, the language <span>of React</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17">How to use the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">useEffect</strong> Hooks for state management and <span>API communication</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17">Features of React Router and other packages within the <span>React ecosystem</span></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor093" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">Creating a React-based application involves several steps, including setting up a build system and a transpiler, creating a directory structure, and more. You must install the following tools before you start developing <span>your application:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="bold">Vite</strong>: Vite requires Node.js versions 18+ or 20+ in order to run, but you can always check the documentation at <a href="https://vitejs.dev" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span>https://vitejs.dev</span></a> <span>for updates.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="bold">Node.js</strong>:<strong class="bold"> </strong>You can download Node.js for your operating system from<strong class="bold"> </strong><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span>https://nodejs.org/en/download/</span></a>. When installing, check all the boxes – you want <strong class="bold">npm</strong> (<strong class="bold">Node.js’ package manager</strong>) and optional additional command-line tools if you are on a <span>Windows machine.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="bold">Visual Studio Code</strong>: Install a React extension called <strong class="bold">ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets </strong>to help speed up the creation of components of a <span>React app.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="bold">React Developer Tools</strong> : Install the React Developer Tools browser extension (<a href="https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span>https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools</span></a>). This enables debugging your React apps quicker and spotting potential <span>problems easily.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor094" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Creating a React app using Vite</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">React is a JavaScript library for building <strong class="bold">user interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">UIs</strong>), particularly for <strong class="bold">single-page applications</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPAs</strong>) but also for traditional server-side-rendered applications. It offers reusable UI components that are able to manage their own state, allowing for the creation of complex and dynamic web applications with simplicity and <span>high scalability.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">React is based on the virtual <strong class="bold">document object model</strong> (<strong class="bold">DOM</strong>). It minimizes manipulations of the actual DOM, improving performance. As stated in the introduction, React’s robust ecosystem includes libraries, tools, and frameworks such as <strong class="bold">Next.js</strong>, <strong class="bold">Remix.js</strong>, mobile-centric <strong class="bold">React Native</strong>, and numerous Hooks. These features enable developers to build versatile and <span>high-performance applications.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Vite is a modern build tool designed to simplify and speed up the development of web applications with React, but also with Vue.js, Svelte, and other frameworks and libraries. It offers a fast development server that supports features such as hot module replacement, ensuring quick updates without losing the application’s current state. Unlike traditional setups, Vite separates app modules into dependencies and source code, employing <strong class="source-inline">esbuild</strong> for fast dependency bundling and serving source code using native <strong class="bold">ECMAScript Modules</strong> (<strong class="bold">ESMs</strong>). This approach results in faster server start and update times, enhancing productivity <span>during development.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Vite supports the scaffolding of numerous types of projects, such as Svelte, Preact, Solid.js, <span>and more.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Let's start by creating a simple app that you will be building upon in <span>this introduction:</span></p>
			<ol class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre15">Pick a folder of your choice, for example, <strong class="source-inline">chapter5</strong>. Set it to the working directory with <strong class="source-inline">cd</strong>, and from your terminal of choice, run the following command to create a <span>React template:</span><pre class="source-code">
npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react</pre></li>				<li class="calibre15">Unlike the Create React App tool, Vite requires manual installation of all the Node.js dependencies. Change the working directory into your <strong class="source-inline">/</strong><span><strong class="source-inline">frontend</strong></span><span> directory:</span><pre class="source-code">
cd frontend</pre></li>				<li class="calibre15">Next, you can install the dependencies by running the <span>following command:</span><pre class="source-code">
npm install</pre><p class="list-inset">Once this process is complete, you will have a properly initiated React project ready to <span>be developed.</span></p></li>				<li class="calibre15">Although you can start your project with a simple command (<strong class="source-inline">npm run dev</strong>), this is the opportunity to install your CSS framework, <strong class="bold">Tailwind CSS</strong>, as it is easier to begin with the Tailwind CSS setup and not have to deal with the few bundled Vite-specific CSS styles. Run the following commands to install the CSS framework in order to install the Tailwind framework and initialize its <span>configuration file:</span><pre class="source-code">
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p</pre><p class="list-inset">While the first command installs Tailwind itself and a couple of needed packages as development dependencies, the second creates a <strong class="source-inline">tailwind.config.js</strong> file, the file that you will be using for fine-tuning and configuring your instance <span>of Tailwind.</span></p></li>				<li class="calibre15">It is useful to set up a simple project to showcase basic React concepts. Configure your newly created <strong class="source-inline">tailwind.config.js</strong> file by replacing the contents of the file with the following code. The configuration of Tailwind for React is <span>the following:</span><pre class="source-code">
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}</pre></li>				<li class="calibre15">Finally, edit the <strong class="source-inline">src/index.css</strong> file that Vite created and populated with some default styles. Delete everything, and insert the <strong class="source-inline">tailwind</strong> <span>directives instead:</span><pre class="source-code">
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;</pre><p class="list-inset">Now, you have a basic React application with a <span>Tailwind setup.</span></p><p class="list-inset">The latest documentation of this process is usually available on the excellent Tailwind CSS website (<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span>https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite</span></a>) along with similar documents for Next.js, Remix.js, and <span>other frameworks.</span></p><p class="list-inset">Delete the <strong class="source-inline">App.css</strong> file since you will not be using it, and then perform the following steps to populate the landing page of <span>your application.</span></p></li>				<li class="calibre15">Replace the contents of <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> by pasting the <span>following code:</span><pre class="source-code">
export default function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="bg-purple-800 text-white min-h-screen p-4 flex flex-col justify-center  items-center"&gt;
      &lt;h1 className="text-3xl font-thin"&gt;
        Hello FARM stack!
      &lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}</pre></li>				<li class="calibre15">Back in the terminal, start your React project with the <span>following command:</span><pre class="source-code">
npm run dev</pre></li>			</ol>
			<p class="calibre5">If you open a browser tab on port <strong class="source-inline">5173</strong> (<strong class="source-inline">http://localhost:5173/</strong>), which is the default for Vite, you will be greeted by a purple screen and the title <em class="italic">Hello FARM stack!</em> in  the middle of the page. However, behind this page, there is some code and many packages, and you can examine this generated code by looking inside the frontend folder that the Vite build tool built <span>for you.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In your project, there is a <strong class="source-inline">node_modules</strong> directory that contains all the project dependencies. You don’t need to touch this folder except for extreme <span>debugging operations.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">In the <strong class="source-inline">public</strong> folder, there are a couple of generic files that you will not use in this project, such as the png logos and the <strong class="source-inline">favicon.ico</strong> file. This folder will contain static assets that Vite will not process, such as images, fonts and so on. You can leave it as is or use it later for files that will be served to users without any <span>Vite modification.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">In the <strong class="source-inline">/src</strong> directory there is an important HTML file called <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong>. This bare-bones file contains a <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element with the <strong class="source-inline">id</strong> parameter of the root. This <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element is the place where React will load your <span>entire application.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">You will be creating most of the application in the <strong class="source-inline">/src</strong> directory. The <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file that represents your entire application will be living inside this file, which, in turn, will be rendered in your single <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element with the <strong class="source-inline">id</strong> parameter of the root in the <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file. This complexity is necessary for the declarative approach that React will be able to provide us with while developing, in just a few more steps. At this point, different approaches are possible depending on your use case, so you might want to create additional folders for components or pages or group functionalities <span>by features.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">React enables you to style applications in a myriad of ways. You can use classic CSS style sheets or <strong class="bold">syntactically awesome style sheets</strong> (<strong class="bold">SASS</strong>), you can opt for JavaScript-style objects, or you can choose a modern but efficient solution such as <strong class="bold">styled-components</strong>. Additionally, all the major UI/CSS frameworks have a React version, for example, Material UI, Bootstrap, and <span>Semantic UI.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Throughout this book, you will be using Tailwind CSS, which has an atypical approach that busy developers tend to like, as it doesn’t get in the way. It is excellent for defining basic, simple styles that make the page look simple and clean, but it is also good for achieving pixel-perfect designs from Figma or Adobe XD files <span>if needed.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor095" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Tailwind CSS and installation</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that translates CSS into classes that can be used directly in the markup and enables you to achieve complex designs. Just by adding classes to your HTML elements, you will be able to create completely styled documents. Check out the Tailwind documentation at <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span>https://tailwindcss.com/</span></a>, as you will be using it for all your React <span>styling needs.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Your <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file has a <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element with the following list <span>of classes:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="source-inline">bg-purple-800</strong>: To make the <span>background purple</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="source-inline">text-white</strong>: To make the <span>text white</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="source-inline">min-h-screen</strong>: To make the <span>height full-screen</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="source-inline">p-4</strong>: To <span>add padding</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="source-inline">flex</strong>: To display a <span>flex container</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="source-inline">flex-col</strong>: To set the flex direction to a <span>vertical one</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="source-inline">justify-center</strong>: To justify the <span>item’s center</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17"><strong class="source-inline">items-center</strong>: To center the items across the <span>secondary axis</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre5"><strong class="source-inline">className</strong> is from <strong class="bold">JavaScript Syntax Extension</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSX</strong>), React’s language for creating HTML. Visual Studio Code does some autocompletion as soon as you type in the <span>first quote.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">This is a basic <strong class="bold">React + Tailwind</strong> setup. If you want to practice Tailwind CSS a bit, try creating a full-height page with some dashed borders and <span>some titles.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The next section will tackle the most fundamental parts of React by <span>using JSX.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor096" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Components and building blocks of JSX</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">According to the latest Stack Overflow Developer Survey from 2023<span id="footnote-002-backlink"><a class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2" href="B22406_05.xhtml#footnote-002">1</a></span>, React is the developers’ top choice, and still the most popular frontend JavaScript library by a large margin. Like FastAPI, React boasts an incredibly well-written and structured documentation website (<a href="https://react.dev/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span>https://react.dev/</span></a>), so starting from there and making your way up is one of the best things you can do when starting your React journey and even when you have become a <span>seasoned developer.</span></p>
			<div id="footnote-002" class="_idfootnote" epub:type="footnote">
				<p class="footnote"><a class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2" href="B22406_05.xhtml#footnote-002-backlink">1</a>	<a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-webframe" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span>https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-webframe</span></a></p>
			</div>
			<p class="calibre5">To put it simply, React enables you to craft UIs using a much simpler and more efficient way compared to plain JavaScript or first-generation JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, as it takes care of operations that would prove to be very tedious and error-prone if performed with plain JavaScript. React achieves this with the help of JSX, which is an enhanced JavaScript and HTML mix that React compiles <span>into JavaScript.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">To be more precise, JSX is a JavaScript extension used in React to build interactive functionalities and UIs in a visually intuitive way. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making the code easier to understand <span>and maintain.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">React performs two essential functions, which are visible in the <strong class="source-inline">main.jsx</strong> file of your newly created Vite project. If you open and inspect the file, you will see two packages imported. React is responsible for using features such as JSX, while ReactDOM performs operations on <span>the DOM.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The keyword in every React description is <strong class="bold">declarative,</strong> so you, as a developer, can describe (declare) the UI and the associated data flow and actions. Then, React will figure out how to achieve the desired functionality through its mechanisms <span>and optimizations.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">JSX is the glue that holds the whole React concept together. The smallest building blocks of a React page or app are <strong class="bold">React elements</strong>. A simple element might be <span>as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
const title = &lt;h1&gt;The Car Sales App&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>			<p class="calibre5">This code looks like an <strong class="source-inline">h1 HTML</strong> element, but it also looks like JavaScript. Both observations are valid, because JSX enables you to create React elements that can be inserted into React’s virtual DOM tree, which is different from the actual HTML. React takes care of the tedious job of updating the DOM to match the virtual DOM through a process called <strong class="bold">diffing</strong>, and then compiles the JSX elements (through a tool called Babel) into actual <span>HTML elements.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">React elements are immutable, which means that once you create them, you cannot change them, and as the React website states, they are like single frames in a movie. However, they can be replaced with new elements <span>or frames.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">It is important to note that every React component, including your <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file, which is currently the only component that you have, must return only one element—a <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element or a fragment (essentially, an empty tag, <strong class="source-inline">&lt;&gt;</strong>) and all the React elements enclosed in it. The following examples will show you how to craft <span>some components:</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Create some simple elements in your <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file by pasting the <span>following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
export default function App() {
    const data = [{
            id: 1,
            name: "Fiat"
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            name: "Peugeot"
        },
        {
            id: 3,
            name: "Ford"
        },
        {
            id: 4,
            name: "Renault"
        },
        {
            id: 5,
            name: "Citroen"
        }
    ]
    return (
        &lt;div className="bg-purple-800 text-white min-h-screen p-4 flex flex-col items-center"&gt;
            &lt;div className="mb-4 space-y-5"&gt;
                &lt;h2&gt;Your budget is {budget}&lt;/h2&gt;
                &lt;label htmlFor="budget"&gt;Budget : &lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;input type="number" className="text-black" step={1000} id="budget" value={budget} onChange={(e) =&gt; setBudget(e.target.value)} /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4"&gt;
                {data.filter((el) =&gt; el.price &lt;= budget).map((el) =&gt; {
                    return (
                        &lt;Card car={el} key={el.id} /&gt;
                    )
                }
                )}
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div &gt;
    );
}</pre>			<p class="calibre5">When you run your web app, you should see the following <span>page rendered:</span></p>
			<div class="_idfootnote">
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="img---figure1">
					<img src="image/B22406_05_01.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" class="calibre38"/>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor097" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Recap</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">Let us review what you created in your <span>React app:</span></p>
			<ol class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre15">First, you declared some data, a simple list of car brands in an array. For now, the data is hard-coded, but this data might be loaded from an <span>external API.</span></li>
				<li class="calibre15">Then, in the <strong class="source-inline">return</strong> statement, you map over this array by using the JavaScript <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> function, iterating by referencing each element of the array <span>as </span><span><strong class="source-inline">el</strong></span><span>.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="calibre5">Finally, you return these elements. In this case, they are strings, and you wrap them in <strong class="bold">template literals</strong> (another ES6 feature) and transform them to uppercase by using another JavaScript function. The whole function returns exactly one <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element. Since <strong class="bold">class </strong>is a reserved name in JavaScript, React uses the <strong class="source-inline">className</strong> keyword, and you can see how it was used quite a bit since Tailwind is very verbose. Finally, there’s a little addition to the <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file, so React doesn’t complain in the console—a key property so React can handle our list even when it changes. You can read about the purpose and need for this key in the documentation <span>here: </span><a href="https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span><span>https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The key is a unique identifier that React needs anytime it creates arrays of DOM elements, so it knows which one to replace, keep, or remove. This is a rather simplistic example, but it shows the basics of the power of JSX. An important thing to remember is that you must return <em class="italic">exactly one element</em>, such as a <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element, a title, or a React fragment. Functional components are, after all, functions (and you will only be working with <span>functional components).</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">React does not have a dedicated templating language with a special syntax for looping over arrays of objects or <strong class="source-inline">if-else</strong> constructs. Instead, you can rely on the full power of JavaScript and use the standard language features such as <strong class="source-inline">map</strong> for iterating through arrays, <strong class="source-inline">filter</strong> for filtering data, ternary operators for <strong class="source-inline">if-else</strong> constructs, template literals for string interpolations, <span>and more.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The next section will discuss <span>React components.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor098" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Components</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">Components are reusable pieces of the UI. They are the functions returning pieces or units of UI written in JSX. They are the building blocks of UI in React, allowing you to create modular, reusable pieces of code that can be composed to form the desired output of the <span>user interface.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5"><span><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> shows an application user interface that is visually broken into separate components. Each rectangle represents an independent component that is imported into the main app component. Some might be repeated several times, while others, such as the header and the footer, might be present with only <span>one instance:</span></p>
			<div class="_idfootnote">
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="img---figure1">
					<img src="image/B22406_05_02.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" class="calibre39"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="calibre5" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.2: Breaking an app into components</p>
			<p class="calibre5">One of the first stages of planning the development of a React site is the identification of areas, or pieces, that could be abstracted into components and reused in some way or at least abstracted into <span>separate units.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Next, we will create a minimal component for displaying the header on a page. The component should have an easy task: to display the header, in your case, the title of <span>the page.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Functional components in React.js are defined as files with <strong class="source-inline">.jsx</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">.js</strong> extensions, and like your <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file (the root component), they must return a single JSX element. The filenames should be capitalized. This is a great moment in which to use your previously installed React extension for Visual Studio Code as it provides useful snippets for creating standard components.

			<p class="calibre5">Now, instead of returning the <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> elements when mapping through your data, you are returning your <strong class="source-inline">Card</strong> component and passing it the key—that is, the ID of the <strong class="source-inline">car</strong> object. Note that the ID has to be unique or React will throw warnings in the console indicating that we haven’t specified it. Additionally, you’re passing something that you can refer to as <strong class="source-inline">el</strong> and set to the element—the <strong class="source-inline">car</strong> object from your <span>data array.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Your <strong class="source-inline">Card</strong> component is now able to display data related to the cars—each card holds the data of a single car. You passed data through props (short for properties) to each card. You just have to accept it in <span>the component.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">It is easy to pass props to components, but since props provide one-way communication, in most apps, you will have to deal with the <strong class="bold">state</strong> as well, which is discussed in the <span>next section</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor100" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Events and state</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">React exposes and wraps all the standard DOM events—button and link clicks, form submissions, mouse hovers, keyups and keydowns, and more. Handling these events in React is relatively intuitive. A click event will be handled by a synthetic event called <strong class="source-inline">onClick</strong>; events are named by using the <strong class="bold">camelCase naming convention</strong>. In React, <strong class="bold">event handlers</strong> are functions that are triggered when an interaction occurs. These functions accept function handlers, which are other functions, as props. The simplest possible case would be clicking a button (although it could be any <span>DOM element).</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Create a simple component in a file called <strong class="source-inline">Button.jsx</strong> in the <strong class="source-inline">/components</strong> directory that contains a button that, when clicked, displays a message in <span>the console:</span></p>
			<ol class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre15">Paste the following code into your <strong class="source-inline">Button.jsx</strong> file after performing the <span><strong class="source-inline">racfe</strong></span><span> action:</span><pre class="source-code">

    )
}
export default Button</pre><p class="list-inset">This is a simple example and it showcases the underlying mechanism; <strong class="source-inline">onClick</strong> is React’s way of knowing what event it should listen to and the <strong class="source-inline">handleClick</strong> function executes your (rather simple) business logic. If you import the button into the <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file and click the button, you should see the messages in <span>the console.</span></p></li>				<li class="calibre15">The implementation is very simple; update the <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> component with <span>the following:</span><pre class="source-code">

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94" class="about-the-author"><a id="_idTextAnchor101" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>React Hooks with events and state</h2>
			<p class="calibre5">The components of React are essentially functions that convert a state to a user interface. A React component isa function that takes props as arguments. It can be thought of as an updatable data structure responsible for the component behavior. The output of the function, the component, is a JSX element. Essentially, React Hooks are functional constructs that enable you to tap into the life cycle of a component and change <span>its state.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">While there are many standard React Hooks and numerous external ones, you will work with only two, which are the most fundamental for React comprehension: <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">useEffect</strong>. These two Hooks will remain in the forthcoming React version 19, while others, such as <strong class="source-inline">useMemo</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">useCallback</strong>, and some others, will be gradually deprecated. It is also true that while mastering React takes some time, much of standard UI functionality can be achieved through clever combinations of these <span>two Hooks.</span></p>
			<h3 class="calibre8">Creating stateful variables with useState</h3>
			<p class="calibre5">The <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> Hook allows you to maintain a certain state throughout your component. For example, you might want to maintain some kind of state in your SPA, so the website doesn’t show you any cars that are too expensive based on your specified budget. You can make a simple textbox, set it to display just numeric values, and hook it up with a state variable that you can <span>name </span><span><strong class="source-inline">budget</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Replace the contents of the <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file with the <span>following code:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import { useState } from "react";
import Card from "./components/Card";
export default function App() {
  const data = [
    { id: 1, name: "Fiat", year: 2023, model: "Panda", price: 12000 },
    { id: 2, name: "Peugeot", year: 2018, model: "308", price: 16000 },
    { id: 3, name: "Ford", year: 2022, model: "Mustang", price: 25000 },
    { id: 4, name: "Renault", year: 2019, model: "Clio", price: 18000 },
    { id: 5, name: "Citroen", year: 2021, model: "C3 Aircross", price: 22000 },
    { id: 6, name: "Toyota", year: 2020, model: "Yaris", price: 15000 },
    { id: 7, name: "Volkswagen", year: 2021, model: "Golf", price: 28000 },
    { id: 8, name: "BMW", year: 2022, model: "M3", price: 45000 },
    { id: 9, name: "Mercedes", year: 2021, model: "A-Class", price: 35000 },
    { id: 10, name: "Audi", year: 2022, model: "A6", price: 40000 }
  ]
  const [budget, setBudget] = useState(20000)
  return (
    &lt;div className="bg-purple-800 text-white min-h-screen p-4 flex flex-col items-center"&gt;
      &lt;div className="mb-4 space-y-5"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Your budget is {budget}&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;label htmlFor="budget"&gt;Budget : &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="number" className="text-black" step={1000} id="budget" value={budget} onChange={(e) =&gt; setBudget(e.target.value)} /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

<strong class="bold">        {data.filter((el) =&gt; el.price &lt;= budget).map((el) =&gt; {</strong>
          return (
            &lt;Card car={el} key={el.id} /&gt;
          )
        }
        )}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div &gt;
  );
}</pre>			<p class="calibre5">In the preceding example, you first import the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> Hook from React. The <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> Hook returns <span>two values:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17">A variable, which can be anything you want—an array or an object, a simple number, or <span>a string</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17">A function that sets the value for this <span>state variable</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre5">Although you can use any legal JavaScript name, it is a good convention to use the name of the variable—in your case, <strong class="source-inline">budget</strong>—and the same name prepended with <strong class="source-inline">set</strong>: <strong class="source-inline">setBudget</strong>. With this simple line of code, you have told React to set up a state unit called <strong class="source-inline">budget</strong> and to set up a setter. The argument of the <strong class="source-inline">useState()</strong> call is the initial value. In the following case, you have set it to 20,000 dollars. </p>
			<p class="calibre5">The following image shows the updated web app with the updateable <span>budget box:</span></p>
			<div class="_idfootnote">
				<div id="_idContainer029" class="img---figure1">
					<img src="image/B22406_05_03.jpg" alt="" role="presentation" class="calibre40"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="calibre5" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.3: Listing cars</p>
			<p class="calibre5">Now, you are free to use this state variable across the page. Here, you placed the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> call inside the <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> functional component—if you try to place it elsewhere, it will not work: Hooks tap into the lifecycle of components from the inside of the bodies of the functions defining the <span>components themselves!</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Moving down to the bottom of the component, you added a simple textbox. You can set it to display only numeric values with HTML and a step of <strong class="source-inline">1000</strong> and add an <span><strong class="source-inline">onChange</strong></span><span> handler.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">This is a good moment to emphasize yet again that React uses the so-called <strong class="bold">synthetic event</strong>, a wrapper around the browser’s native events that enables React to achieve cross-browser compatibility. Once you have remembered a couple of differences (that the events are using camelCase rather than lowercase, and you must pass them a function in JSX), you will be writing event handlers in <span>no time.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">In your app, you added an <strong class="source-inline">onChange</strong> event to the textbox and set it to handle the state, then you set the new value of the budget. Every time you change the value, the <strong class="source-inline">setBudget</strong> function fires, and, as a consequence, the budget updates and different <strong class="source-inline">Card</strong> instances are displayed that match your <span>budget constraints.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">This <strong class="source-inline">onChange</strong> event takes the current value of the textbox (<strong class="source-inline">target.value</strong>, just like the original DOM events, as it’s just a wrapper) and sets your budget state to this value using our <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> call defined just above <span>the function.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Finally, you’ve added a <strong class="source-inline">div</strong> element component that uses this budget value and displays it. You have added a state variable to your app’s root component. You can set it, get it, and display it on <span>the page.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Now, you have accomplished another task typical for developing React apps. You have allowed the user to enter their budget and you are displaying it on the page. If you want to differentiate between cars that fit said budget and those that do not, you will make use of some simple JavaScript and component state. To get this to work, set your small data sample that is currently hardcoded to be a state variable itself, so the user can just filter it and display only those cars within the <span>price range.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The procedure is simple and involves pure JavaScript to accomplish the task of displaying an array of cars satisfying the condition that their price is less than or equal to your budget. Hint: Use JavaScript filtering arrays as shown in bold in the following <span>code sample:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
{data.<strong class="bold">filter</strong>((el) =&gt; el.price &lt;= budget).map((el) =&gt; {
    return (
        &lt;Card car={el} key={el.id} /&gt;
        )
    }
)}</pre>			<p class="calibre5">At this point, you can dive into the excellent React.js documentation and learn more about the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> Hook and its sibling, the <strong class="source-inline">useReducer</strong> Hook (<a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useState" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span>https://react.dev/reference/react/useState</span></a>). This is a Hook that might be thought of as a generalization of the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> Hook. It is best suited when you have to deal with numerous pieces of state that are interconnected, so managing them with many simple <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> Hooks could end up being tedious and difficult <span>to maintain.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">In this section, you have seen how the <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> Hook enables you to add a stateful variable in a very simple and straightforward way and how to manipulate the state through <span>regular events.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Next, you will learn how you can get your data from your efficient FastAPI backend into your React.js frontend. You will get to know another Hook <span>called </span><span><strong class="source-inline">useEffect</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor102" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Communicating with APIs and the outside world using useEffect</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">Here, you can use a free mock REST API. However, you do need to address the problem of accessing external data and the management of external events. External to what, you <span>might wonder?</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">You have seen that React and its mighty Hooks are centered around the task of synchronizing the UI to the state and the data. Components can contain other components, and together, they form what is known as a <strong class="bold">component tree</strong>, which is then constantly compared to the current state. React does all of this coordination work, to determine what should be rendered, updated, <span>and more.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Events that are outside of the React data flow process are called <strong class="bold">side effects</strong>. Notable examples of React side effects are <span>as follows:</span></p>
			<ul class="calibre14">
				<li class="calibre17">Performing API calls—sending or receiving data from an <span>external server</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17">Subscribing to external data sources via websockets <span>or streams</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17">Setting or getting data values to and from the local storage or <span>session storage</span></li>
				<li class="calibre17">Event listeners and their <span>cleanup functions</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="calibre5">Remember that React works in a continuous data flow, with an underlying system constantly scanning for updates and ready to re-render components that it deems in need of an update. The following example will <span>illustrate this.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Consider that you are working on your <em class="italic">Car Sales</em> application and you need to list all the users that have registered an account. The task at hand is a simple and common one. You have a dedicated page—it will live in a URL called <strong class="source-inline">/users</strong> or something similar, and it should be populated with the data (think of a JavaScript array of objects) from an external API. This API will be powered by FastAPI, but for now, you will use a readymade mock solution <span>called Jsonplaceholder.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The <strong class="source-inline">GET</strong> call you need to make should be directed toward the <span>URL </span><a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"><span><span>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">You already understand how to make components, provide them with props, and set their state, so that shouldn’t be a problem. When it comes to loading data from an external API, you might just use something such as <strong class="source-inline">Fetch</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">Axios</strong>, as if you were using a normal plain JavaScript app. <strong class="source-inline">Fetch</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">Axios</strong> are the two most popular JavaScript libraries used for making HTTP requests <span>to servers.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Trying to fetch the data in a React component and then setting the state to the resulting JSON would start an <strong class="bold">infinite loop</strong>. Bear in mind that React came before the server component with async <span>code existed.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Whenever the state of a component changes and the component is re-rendered, the new render again triggers a <strong class="source-inline">fetch</strong> call to the API, the state changes again to be set to the list of users, and <span>so on.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">In this component’s data flow, the fetching of the data is considered external—not part of the main component life cycle. It is executed after the component has <span>been executed.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">To deal with this problem, React has a very elegant solution—the <strong class="source-inline">useEffect</strong> Hook. You can create a new application by editing the <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> main component, and then display a list of users from your <span>API endpoint.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">You can implement a possible solution using the <strong class="source-inline">useEffect</strong> Hook. Paste the following code into your <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file (<span>refer </span><span><strong class="source-inline">App3.jsx</strong></span><span>):</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
export default function App() {
    const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        fetchUsers();
    }, []);
    const fetchUsers = () =&gt; {
        fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
            .then((res) =&gt; res.json())
            .then((data) =&gt; setUsers(data));
    };
    return (
        &lt;div className="bg-purple-800 text-white min-h-screen p-4 flex flex-col items-center"&gt;
            &lt;h2 className="mb-4"&gt;List of users&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4"&gt;
                &lt;ol&gt;
                    {users.map((user) =&gt; (
                        &lt;li key={user.id}&gt;{user.name}&lt;/li&gt;
                    ))}
                &lt;/ol&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}</pre>			<p class="calibre5">At the top of the <strong class="source-inline">App.jsx</strong> file, import <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">useEffect</strong> and then you can begin creating your sole state variable—the <strong class="source-inline">users</strong> array—initializing it to an <span>empty array.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The <strong class="source-inline">fetchUsers</strong> function is simple—it makes a call to the API and returns data in JSON format, using promises. It could also have been an <span><strong class="source-inline">async</strong></span><span>/</span><span><strong class="source-inline">await</strong></span><span> function.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The <strong class="source-inline">useEffect</strong> Hook, as with all Hooks, is executed inside the component function. It does not return a value, however, and it accepts two arguments: the function to be executed (in this case, <strong class="source-inline">fetchUsers</strong>), and a dependency array, an array of values whose change in value will trigger a new execution of the effect. If the function should trigger only once, the array should be empty. If you want to fetch other users from the next API URL, you must add the URL to <span>the array.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">As with <strong class="source-inline">useState</strong>, there are many more subtleties involved. For example, you can provide a cleanup function at the bottom of the <strong class="source-inline">useEffect</strong> body to make sure that any long-lasting effects are removed, but this should give you a basic idea of how to handle actions that reach out to an <span>external API.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Additionally, <strong class="source-inline">useContext</strong> allows React to cover an entire area of components and pass values directly without having to pass them through several components that might not actually need it, a procedure called prop drilling. You can even create your own Hooks and abstract functionality that can be reused in several places of the app, ensuring better maintainability and <span>less repetition.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">With the introduction of Hooks, the whole ecosystem becomes much clearer and cleaner, and the mapping of business logic to UIs is much more streamlined <span>and logical.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">You now have the knowledge that is necessary to set and get states in your components or apps and to communicate with external API services in a predictable and controllable way, while crafting clean and simple code. Just using React and its Hooks can give you web developer proficiency, but there is a whole ecosystem of packages and modules built around React that can be just as important and useful as the <span>core libraries.</span></p>

			<p class="calibre5">So far, you have only created a couple of single-page apps, but you haven’t touched some advanced functionalities. However, single-page apps are not limited to a single URL.  For example, if you navigate to your Gmail account, you will see that the URL changes with every action that you <span>might take.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">While there are several solutions that enable you to achieve routing in SPAs, React Router is the standard solution, and it is a well-tested, <span>mature package.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The underlying idea of a frontend page router is that it should enable rendering different components on the same page depending on the route that is loaded. For instance, the <strong class="source-inline">/about</strong> route would cause the app to load a component called <strong class="source-inline">About.jsx</strong> in the main <strong class="source-inline">App</strong> component, removing other previously loaded components. The package provides a basic structure, within the <strong class="source-inline">BrowserRouter</strong> class, which can be used to wrap an entire root <span><strong class="source-inline">App</strong></span><span> component.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">React is such a popular framework that there is a diverse ecosystem of tools and integrations that you can learn about. As you’ve already seen earlier, besides Tailwind, you can use virtually any UI or CSS framework either directly or through some optimized React version, such as Bootstrap, or more tightly coupled with React, such as Ant Design. You can enhance your user experience with subtle animations through Framer Motion, and you can speed up the development of forms with some excellent form libraries such as React Hook Form. For complex state problems, Redux is the most popular and widely adopted industry standard, but there are many smaller or specialized libraries for local and global state management, such as <strong class="bold">Recoil</strong>, <strong class="bold">Zustand</strong>, or <span><strong class="bold">React Query</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-97" class="contributor"><a id="_idTextAnchor104" class="calibre7 pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre4 pcalibre1 pcalibre2"/>Summary</h1>
			<p class="calibre5">This chapter provided a short introduction to the world’s most popular user <span>interface library—React.js.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">This chapter also detailed what JSX is and why it’s so convenient for developers. It explored the basic building blocks of React, functional components, and the basic rules that must be followed when designing them. It also introduced two fundamental React Hooks that, when combined, allow you to begin building basic user interfaces, maintain and change the state of the components, and interact with <span>external APIs.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">Finally, the chapter covered the implementation of some of the React libraries that will make your life easier when developing custom applications. These libraries all have excellent documentation and are <span>updated frequently.</span></p>
			<p class="calibre5">The next chapter will use some of this basic knowledge and React to create a simple but fully functional and <span>dynamic application.</span></p>

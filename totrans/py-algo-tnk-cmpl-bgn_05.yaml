    students use computers to search the Internet and to send emails. At work, people
    use them to make presentations, to analyze data, and to communicate with customers.
    At home, people use computers to play games, to connect to social networks and
    to chat with other people all over the world. Of course, don't forget smartphones
    such as iPhones. They are computers as well!

    programmed. In other words, a computer can perform any job that a program tells
    it to. A program is a set of statements (often called instructions or commands)
    that a computer follows in order to perform a specific task.

    machine that can do nothing at all. It is the program that actually tells the
    computer what to do and when to do it. On the other hand, the programmer or the
    software developer is the person who designs, creates, and often tests computer
    programs.

    If you have ever opened the case of a computer or a laptop you have probably seen
    many of its components, such as the microprocessor (CPU), the memory, and the
    hard disk. A computer is not a device but a system of devices that all work together.
    The basic components of a typical computer system are discussed here.

    the computer (but cannot be changed). All programs and data stored in this type
    of memory are not lost when the computer is switched off. ROM usually contains
    manufacturer's instructions as well as a program called the bootstrap loader whose
    function is to start the operation of computer system once the power is turned

    program (application software) you like. This is usually done by clicking, double
    clicking, or tapping the program's corresponding icon. For example, let's say
    you click on the icon of your favorite word processor. This action orders your
    computer to copy (or load) the word processing program from your hard disk to
    the main memory (RAM) so the CPU can execute it.

    statement in the high-level language program, it translates it into a machine
    language code and then directly executes it. This process is repeated for every
    statement in the program.

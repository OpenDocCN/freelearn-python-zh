    in this chapter. We will begin with a basic introduction to robotics, with some
    definitions and explanations about robotics systems and a little bit of history
    about robots. Then, we will look into the robotics system structure, just like
    we did in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Introduction to Physical Computing
    Systems"), *Introduction to Physical Computing Systems*, regarding physical computing
    systems. We will take a look at the basic blocks of hardware and software involved
    in robotic systems, which is similar to our physical computing systems. Then,
    we will look into their operation, followed by differential drive robots at the
    end, because we will be building a differential drive robot in the next chapter.

    the humanoid terminator robot from the Terminator movies when they hear the word
    "robot". Even though it is true that the word robot relates to similar types of
    robots, people forget that the exact meaning of robots is not just that. Actually,
    that is just one type of robot: the humanoid type robots or—as people call them
    these days—androids are robots that resemble humans. We are still at the beginning
    stages of android robot development—there is a long way to go in that field of
    research if we are to reach results similar to science fiction movie robots.'

    on which technology is being used in the robotic system and what application the
    robotic system performs. Relating to the known definition of the physical computing
    system, we can define a robotic system as any physical computing system that is
    composed of electromechanical actuators that can either autonomously or semi-autonomously
    perform actions guided by a computer program running on its electronic hardware
    circuit.

    such a way that they are capable of carrying out one specific task or multiple
    tasks with speed and accuracy. You can easily buy many different types of robotic
    systems available in the market for different applications, starting from vacuum
    cleaner robots that clean your floors to robots that serve coffee and tea to you
    in a coffee shop and look exactly like a human being. We will discuss some of
    the widespread and current application areas of robots later in this chapter.

    research labs and were costly for people to get until the industrial revolution.
    During the industrial revolution, manufacturers and industries wanted many industrial
    machines to speed up production and produce more items in less time without defects.
    Industrial machines started emerging, which were built from the structure of robotic
    systems such as robotic arms that were built using actuators and were capable
    of lifting heavy weights in the industries. In the early stages, almost all robotic
    systems were operated by humans using a remote control to ensure security and
    flexibility. But as software started becoming cheaper and more reliable, robotic
    systems with semiautonomous functions started to evolve, such as conveyer belts
    with robotic actuators that picked items from the conveyer and packed them automatically,
    and similarly, many other applications started to emerge in the industries. Nowadays,
    there are companies that manufacture food and beverages that are entirely prepared
    and packed by robots, with very little human intervention.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a result of research and development to build smart and intelligent industrial
    robotic systems, many sensors and actuator mechanisms were developed to replace
    human intervention during production in industries, which led to the evolution
    of a wide variety of sensors that are not being developed further to build humanoid
    robots. Even though they showed such robots in movies more than a decade back,
    we still have many years to go until we build robots that can replace human beings.

    by their operation. Like we defined in the previous section, robotic systems are
    very similar to physical computing systems, just that in some physical computing
    systems, you might not have actuators that perform tasks that reduce human effort,
    unlike robotic systems. So, the elements of the systems as well as their operation
    are almost similar. In some cases, the term "physical computing systems" can be
    synonymous with robotic systems as well.

    sensors and output actuators connected to a CPU with input/output ports. The actuators
    are driven based on the computer program running on the CPU, which depends on
    the inputs from the sensors present in the robotic system.

    Sonic Sensor** that detects the distance of any obstacle in front of it from its
    position, and the sensor is connected to the input port of the CPU. Similarly,
    we have a **Motor Controller IC**, or the motor driver IC, which will help us
    drive heavy-duty motors with high voltages for them to run by taking digital inputs
    of low voltages that we get from the microcontroller. So, this motor driver IC
    is connected to the output port of the CPU. The motors are connected to the motor
    driver IC. Based on the inputs given to the motor driver IC, the motor is driven
    in a particular direction. We will look into this IC in detail in the next chapter.
    And, at last, the most important thing is that everything be powered using an
    external power supply, which is usually a DC source, but it can be AC sometimes,
    depending on the application. In our case, for the project in the next chapter,
    it will be DC. If you see the following block diagram of the physical computing
    system from [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Introduction to Physical Computing
    Systems"), *Introduction to Physical Computing Systems*, you can understand that
    it is somewhat similar:'

- en: So, when you compare the structure with the structure of the robotic system
    we use for demonstrative purposes, it comprises a sensor that provides input to
    the CPU, and there is a driver IC that works depending on the output from the
    CPU to drive the motors. And in the CPU, we have software running that will randomly
    make the robot move without hitting any obstacle.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the software, the robot can operate in any way. For example, for
    a random obstacle-avoidance and autonomous robot that moves randomly, it moves
    the robot in the forward direction based on the outputs from the output pins of
    the microcontroller, and at the same time, the software keeps reading the distance
    measured by the ultrasonic sensor. Whenever an obstacle is detected at a set distance
    from the sensor, it is programmed to consider it as an obstacle. So, the program
    stops the motors from running by changing the output signal on the output pins
    of the controllers and then turns the robot either left or right. This can be
    random, or we can instruct it in our code to go only left or right every time
    an obstacle is detected. So, the robot starts to turn in a particular direction
    until there is free space for it to move and then stops again and starts moving
    straight. In this way, the program loop will be running and the robot will be
    moving randomly without hitting anything. This can sound dumb as it doesn't do
    any specific work nor performs any complex task. But when you add some more sensors
    to the system, such as a compass to read the angles at which it is starting to
    turn and some wheel encoders added to measure the distance travelled by the robot,
    and then write a program in such a way that it doesn't repeat travelling in the
    same area, it can become an awesome robot if you mount a vacuum cleaner system
    to it. One such robot is a commercially available vacuum cleaner robot.

    a real-time problem and performs the action. Let's look into such examples, where
    robots with simple hardware but great software are being used in different applications,
    in the next section. Then, in the end, we will come back and look at differential-drive
    robots a little deeper to understand how actually these motors turn in different
    directions based on the motor directions using just two wheels with motors.

    on its own axis when looked at from above. Similarly, when the motor directions
    are reversed, it will spin anticlockwise.

- en: With that, we are at the end of this chapter, where we had a basic introduction
    to robotics, including some examples relating science fiction and reality, followed
    by a brief explanation of how robotic systems are structured and how they work.
    We also looked at some examples and discussed application areas. In the end, we
    also saw how differential-drive robots work and how they can be operated. We will
    be building our own live-video streaming differential-drive robot in the next
    chapter.

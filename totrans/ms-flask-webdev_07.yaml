    focus on Flask. The focus on the database design might seem odd in a book about
    Flask, but choosing the correct database for your application is arguably the
    most important decision that you can make while designing your technology stack.
    In the vast majority of web applications, the database is the bottleneck, so the
    database you pick will determine the overall speed of your app. A study conducted
    by Amazon showed that even a 100 ms delay caused a one percent reduction in sales,
    so speed should always be one of the main concerns of a web developer. There is
    also an abundance of horror stories in the programmer community of web developers
    involving developers choosing a popular NoSQL database and then not really understanding
    what the database requires in terms of administration. This leads to large amounts
    of data loss and crashes, which in turn means the loss of customers. All in all,
    it's no exaggeration to say that your choice of database for your application
    can be the difference between your app succeeding and failing.

- en: NoSQL is a blanket term used to describe nontraditional methods of storing data
    in a database. The vast majority of NoSQL databases are not relational—unlike
    RDBMS—which means that they normally cannot perform operations such as `JOIN`.
    There are a number of other features that distinguish an SQL database from a NoSQL
    database. With a NoSQL database, we have the ability to not impose a fixed schema—for
    example, a collection on MongoDB can hold different fields, and so they can accept
    any kind of document. With NoSQL you can (and should) take advantage of denormalization,
    making a tradeoff between storage and speed.

    value is associated with one key and is accessed via that key. Also, like a Python
    dictionary, most key-value databases have the same read speed regardless of how
    many entries there are. Advanced programmers would know this as **O(1) reads**.
    In some key-value stores, only one key can be retrieved at a time, rather than
    multiple rows in traditional SQL databases. In most key-value stores, the content
    of the value is not queryable, but the keys are. Values are just binary blobs:
    they can be literally anything, from a string to a movie file. However, some key-value
    stores give default types, such as strings, lists, sets, and dictionaries, while
    still giving the option of adding binary data.'

- en: Because of their simplicity, key-value stores are typically very fast. However,
    their simplicity makes them unsuitable as the main database for most applications.
    As such, most key-value store use cases involve storing simple objects that need
    to expire after a certain amount of time. Two common examples of this pattern
    are storing users' session data and shopping cart data. Also, key-value stores
    are commonly used as caches for the application or for other databases. For example,
    results from a commonly run, or CPU-intensive, query or function are stored with
    the query or function name as a key. The application will check the cache in the
    key-value store before running the query on the database, thereby decreasing page
    load times and stress on the database. An example of this functionality will be
    shown in [Chapter 10](657deeac-378d-4d68-8f93-bb2512fe7ad8.xhtml), *Useful Flask

    that there are no type checks at the database level. There is nothing in the database
    to stop an integer from being entered into the title field of a post. Schemaless
    data is the most powerful feature of document stores and attracts many developers
    to adopt it for their apps. However, it can also be considered very dangerous,

- en: There are several things to understand about column family stores before we
    continue. Firstly, in column family stores, data can only be selected via a single
    key or key range; there is no way to query the contents of the columns. To get
    around this, many programmers use an external search tool with their database—such
    as **Elasticsearch**—that stores the contents of columns in a searchable format
    (Lucene's inverted indexes) and returns matching keys to be queried on the database.
    This limitation is why proper *schema* design is so crucial in column family stores,
    and must be carefully thought through before storing any data.
  id: totrans-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在我们继续之前，有几件事情需要了解关于列族存储。首先，在列族存储中，数据只能通过单个键或键范围进行选择；无法查询列的内容。为了解决这个问题，许多程序员使用外部搜索工具与他们的数据库一起使用——例如**Elasticsearch**——该工具以可搜索的格式（Lucene的倒排索引）存储列的内容，并返回匹配的键以在数据库上进行查询。这种限制使得在列族存储中进行适当的**模式**设计变得至关重要，必须在存储任何数据之前仔细考虑。
- en: Secondly, data cannot be ordered by the content of the columns. Data can only
    be ordered by key, which is why the keys to the posts are integers. This allows
    the posts to be returned in the order in which they were entered. This is not
    a requirement for the user table because there is no need to sequentially order
    users.
  id: totrans-29
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 其次，数据不能按列的内容排序。数据只能按键排序，这就是为什么帖子键是整数的原因。这允许帖子以它们被输入的顺序返回。这不是用户表的要求，因为不需要按顺序排列用户。
- en: 'Thirdly, there are no `JOIN` operators, and we cannot query for a column that
    would hold a user key. With our current schema, there is no way to associate a
    post with a user. To create this functionality, we need a third table that holds
    the user to post associations, as follows:'

  zh: 第三，没有`JOIN`运算符，我们无法查询包含用户键的列。根据我们当前的架构，无法将帖子与用户关联起来。为了创建这个功能，我们需要一个包含用户到帖子关联的第三个表，如下所示：

- en: This is slightly different from the other tables we have seen so far. The `Posts`
    column is named a **super column**, which is a column that holds other columns.
    In this table, a super column is associated with our user key, which is holding
    an association of the position of a post to one post. Clever readers might ask
    why we wouldn't just store this association in our `user` table, much like how
    the problem would be solved in document stores. This is because regular columns
    and super columns cannot be held in the same table. You must choose one at the
    creation of each table.

  zh: 这与其他我们迄今为止看到的表格略有不同。`Posts`列被命名为**超级列**，这是一个包含其他列的列。在这个表中，超级列与我们的用户键相关联，它保存了一个帖子位置与一个帖子的关联。聪明的读者可能会问，为什么我们不在我们的`user`表中存储这个关联，就像在文档存储中解决问题一样。这是因为常规列和超级列不能在同一个表中保存。你必须在每个表创建时选择一个。
- en: To get a list of all the posts by a user, we would first have to query the post

    and it is made that way by design. The limiting nature of a column family store

    RDBMSes has existed for over 40 years and is based on the solid theory of relational
    algebra and relational calculus. Because of their maturity, they have a long,

    several methods in place to ensure that the data entered into a database will
    not only be correct, but that data loss will be practically nonexistent. These
    methods combine to form what is known as **ACID** (short for **atomicity**, **consistency**,
    **isolation**, and **durability**). ACID is a set of rules for transactions that
    guarantee that the transaction is handled safely.

  zh: 完整性也是RDBMS最大的卖点之一。RDBMS有几种方法来确保输入数据库的数据不仅正确，而且数据丢失实际上是不存在的。这些方法结合起来形成了所谓的**ACID**（代表**原子性**、**一致性**、**隔离性**和**持久性**）。ACID是一组规则，用于保证事务的安全处理。

  zh: 如果更改或输入的数据存在问题，事务不应该继续运行，因为后续的操作很可能需要前面的操作成功。
- en: The principle of consistency requires that any data that the transaction modifies
    or adds follows the rules of each table. Such rules include type checks, user-defined
    constraints—such as *foreign keys—*cascade rules, and triggers. If any of the
    rules are broken, then according to the atomicity rule, the transaction will be
    thrown out.

  zh: 一致性原则要求事务修改或添加的任何数据都必须遵循每个表的规则。这些规则包括类型检查、用户定义的约束（如*外键*）、级联规则和触发器。如果任何规则被违反，根据原子性规则，事务将被取消。
- en: The principle of isolation requires that if the database runs transactions concurrently
    to speed up writes, then the outcome of the transactions would be the same as
    if they were run serially. This is mostly a rule for database programmers, and
    is not something that web developers need to worry about.

  zh: 隔离性原则要求，如果数据库为了加速写入而并发运行事务，那么事务的结果应该与它们串行运行时相同。这主要是一条针对数据库程序员的规则，并不是网络开发者需要担心的事情。
- en: Finally, the principle of durability requires that once a transaction is accepted,
    the data must never be lost, barring a hard drive failure after the transaction
    is accepted. If the database crashes or loses power, then the durability principle
    requires that any data written before the problem occurred should still be present
    when the server is backed up. This essentially means that all transactions must
    be written to the disk once they are accepted.
  id: totrans-59

  zh: 最后，持久性原则要求一旦事务被接受，数据就绝不能丢失，除非是在事务被接受后硬盘故障。如果数据库崩溃或断电，持久性原则要求在服务器备份时，任何在问题发生之前写入的数据仍然应该存在。这实际上意味着一旦事务被接受，所有事务都必须写入磁盘。

    traditional databases. Out of the box, many NoSQL databases can outperform RDBMSes.
    However, a well-tuned and properly scaled SQL database with read slaves can outperform
    NoSQL databases. Many NoSQL databases, especially document stores, sacrifice consistency
    for availability. This means that they can handle many concurrent reads and writes,
    but those writes may be in conflict with one another. Yet, this is not straightforward,
    as you will soon see when we look at the CAP theorem.

- en: The second feature that pulls people to NoSQL is its ability to handle unformatted
    data. Storing data in XML or JSON allows an arbitrary structure to each document.
    Applications that store user-designed data have benefited greatly from the adoption
    of NoSQL. For example, a video game that allows players to submit their custom
    levels to some central repository can now store the data in a queryable format
    rather than in a binary blob.

- en: The third feature that draws people to NoSQL is the ease of creating a cluster
    of databases working in tandem. Not having `JOIN` operators or only accessing
    values via keys makes splitting the data across servers a rather trivial task
    when compared with RDBMSes. This is due to the fact that `JOIN` operators require
    a scan of the entire table, even if it is split across many different servers.
    The `JOIN` operators become even slower when documents or keys can be assigned
    to a server by an algorithm as simple as the starting character of its unique
    identifier—for example, everything that starts with the letters A–H is sent to
    server 1, I–P to server 2, and Q–Z to server 3\. This makes looking up the location
    of data for a connected client very fast.

  zh: 诺斯克数据库吸引人们的第三个特点是创建一个协同工作的数据库集群非常容易。没有`JOIN`操作符或仅通过键访问值，与关系型数据库管理系统（RDBMSes）相比，将数据分散到服务器上变得相当简单。这是因为`JOIN`操作符需要扫描整个表，即使它分布在许多不同的服务器上。当文档或键可以通过像其唯一标识符的起始字符这样简单的算法分配给服务器时，`JOIN`操作符会变得更慢——例如，以字母A–H开头的所有内容都发送到服务器1，I–P发送到服务器2，Q–Z发送到服务器3。这使得查找连接客户端的数据位置非常快。

    People usually come to this misunderstanding because the marketing on the various

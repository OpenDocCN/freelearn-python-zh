- en: I was born in 1973, and from my early childhood, I discovered a passion for
    computer programming. At the age of 12, I got my first computer—a Commodore 64,
    which incorporated a ROM-based version of the BASIC programming language and 64
    kilobytes of RAM. It introduced me to the world of programming!
